## Question

symptoms of chronic mastoid effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of chronic mastoid effusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "chronic mastoid effusion" is a distinct clinical entity or simply a manifestation of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) extending into the mastoid. Then, I should verify the core symptoms of chronic OME and how often mastoid involvement changes the clinical picture. Next, I will review guideline-backed symptom clusters and their evidentiary basis. After that, I should distinguish incidental mastoid fluid on imaging from clinically significant disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized symptom list and note red flags that warrant escalation, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating entities. "Chronic mastoid effusion" is not a standalone diagnosis in pediatric guidelines; rather, it reflects fluid in the mastoid air cells that accompanies chronic OME, which is defined as middle ear effusion persisting for 3 months or more without acute infection signs, and it is the most common cause of reversible conductive hearing loss in children [^115TPWgh] [^11378QAH].

> Wait, let me verify the core symptom profile of chronic OME, since that will anchor the answer. The dominant symptom is conductive hearing loss, often subtle and detected by caregivers as inattention, volume changes, or school performance issues; balance or vestibular complaints, behavioral changes, ear discomfort, and sleep disruption are also reported, with prospective data showing high symptom burden including otalgia, sleep problems, behavioral issues, and balance symptoms in a substantial fraction of children with OME [^111kWfKM] [^11378QAH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mastoid-specific symptoms. I should confirm whether mastoid involvement itself adds unique features. The literature and guidelines do not describe a distinct mastoid-only symptom complex; instead, mastoid effusion is typically silent or presents with the same OME symptom cluster, and incidental mastoid opacification on imaging frequently lacks correlating otologic findings, reinforcing that mastoid fluid alone is not a reliable source of new symptoms [^111uAJEL] [^11426KN9].

> I will now examine the symptom clusters endorsed by guidelines for chronic OME, since these are the most authoritative. The AAO-HNSF tympanostomy tube guideline lists symptoms that, when attributable to chronic OME, can justify tubes even without meeting hearing-loss thresholds: balance or vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, and reduced quality of life; these align with the OME guideline's emphasis on functional impacts and caregiver-reported burden [^1142hWNf] [^111kWfKM].

> But wait, what if the effusion is truly mastoid-confined or reflects a complication? I should double-check for red flags. Persistent otorrhea, focal mastoid tenderness, erythema or swelling behind the ear, pinna deviation, fever, or neurologic signs suggest mastoiditis or complications and warrant urgent evaluation; imaging studies and case series underscore that mastoid fluid with bony destruction or coalescence signals acute coalescent mastoiditis, which is a different entity than uncomplicated chronic OME with mastoid effusion [^114f2XQj] [^113x9LbA] [^115soK1a].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized symptom list, keeping the evidentiary hierarchy in mind. Primary symptoms include conductive hearing loss and its functional consequences (listening difficulties, school/behavioral impacts), balance or vestibular complaints (clumsiness, unsteadiness), ear discomfort or fullness, and sleep disruption; secondary or associated symptoms include behavioral changes, reduced quality of life, and, in some children, mild otalgia, recognizing that pain is not a defining feature of uncomplicated OME [^111kWfKM] [^11378QAH] [^114r7BTp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "chronic mastoid effusion" might carry a unique symptom such as localized mastoid pressure or deep ache, but I should correct that. There is no guideline-supported mastoid-specific symptom complex for isolated mastoid effusion without concurrent middle ear disease; symptoms reflect the underlying OME and its functional impact, and mastoid fluid on imaging without clinical correlation should not be overinterpreted as disease [^1165A9xp] [^111uAJEL] [^11426KN9].

> Next, I should review how these symptoms translate into management triggers. Chronic OME with attributable symptoms is a recognized indication to consider tympanostomy tubes even when audiometric thresholds are mild, and surveillance with periodic hearing assessment is recommended for persistent effusions; this links symptom recognition to timely intervention and follow-up planning [^114r7BTp] [^1142hWNf] [^117LHq12].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: "chronic mastoid effusion" reflects chronic OME extending into the mastoid and shares the same symptom profile, dominated by conductive hearing loss and functional sequelae, with balance complaints, ear discomfort, behavioral and school impacts, and sleep disturbance variably present; mastoid fluid alone rarely produces distinct symptoms, and new focal pain, swelling, or systemic signs should prompt evaluation for mastoiditis or complications rather than attributing them to effusion alone [^1165A9xp] [^111kWfKM] [^114r7BTp] [^111uAJEL].

Chronic mastoid effusion presents with **conductive hearing loss** as the most consistent symptom, often accompanied by **aural fullness**, **pressure**, or a "plugged ear" sensation [^111kWfKM]. Patients may report **balance disturbances** (dizziness, unsteadiness) and **tinnitus** (ringing or buzzing) [^114r7BTp]. Ear discomfort or mild otalgia can occur, but **significant pain is uncommon** unless there is acute infection or complications [^114KbQJ2]. Many patients are asymptomatic, with effusion detected incidentally on imaging or exam, and symptoms are typically subtle and chronic rather than acute [^111uAJEL].

---

## Common symptoms of chronic mastoid effusion

- **Conductive hearing loss**: The most consistent symptom, typically mild to moderate, due to fluid in the middle ear and mastoid air cells impairing sound transmission [^111kWfKM] [^115TPWgh].

- **Aural fullness or pressure**: Patients often describe a sensation of fullness, pressure, or a "plugged ear" feeling, reflecting fluid accumulation in the mastoid and middle ear spaces [^115S54w7].

- **Balance disturbances**: Dizziness, unsteadiness, or mild vertigo may occur due to involvement of the vestibular system or Eustachian tube dysfunction [^114r7BTp] [^113KBbXm].

- **Tinnitus**: Ringing, buzzing, or other phantom sounds are common, likely related to middle ear fluid and Eustachian tube dysfunction [^111HD218].

- **Ear discomfort or mild otalgia**: Mild ear discomfort or occasional pain may be present, but significant pain is uncommon unless there is acute infection or complications [^114KbQJ2].

- **Asymptomatic cases**: Many patients with chronic mastoid effusion are asymptomatic, with effusion detected incidentally on imaging or clinical examination [^111uAJEL].

---

## Less common symptoms and complications

- **Otorrhea**: Persistent ear discharge may occur if there is a perforation of the tympanic membrane or a tympanostomy tube is present [^116PfbT7].

- **Behavioral changes and developmental delays**: Particularly in children, chronic mastoid effusion can lead to behavioral problems, developmental delays, and speech difficulties due to persistent hearing loss [^111kWfKM] [^115BYjSY].

- **Structural abnormalities**: Chronic effusion can lead to tympanic membrane retraction, atelectasis, and chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) [^115S54w7].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis of chronic mastoid effusion relies on a combination of clinical examination and imaging:

- **Pneumatic otoscopy**: Essential for detecting middle ear effusion and assessing tympanic membrane mobility [^116UGv3G].

- **Tympanometry**: Objective assessment of middle ear status, with flat (type B) tympanograms indicating fluid [^1165A9xp].

- **Imaging**: High-resolution CT or MRI may be used to confirm mastoid effusion, assess the extent of disease, and identify complications such as cholesteatoma or structural abnormalities [^113odNCo] [^115dxUzg].

---

## Conclusion

Chronic mastoid effusion typically presents with **conductive hearing loss**, **aural fullness**, **balance disturbances**, and **tinnitus**, with many cases being asymptomatic. Significant pain is uncommon unless there is acute infection or complications. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent long-term sequelae such as persistent hearing loss, structural abnormalities, and developmental delays.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113pYmHw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Statement 5 — Surveillance of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) states that clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected. This is a recommendation based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies, and level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits include detection of structural changes in the tympanic membrane that may require intervention, detection of new hearing difficulties or symptoms that would lead to reassessing the need for tympanostomy tube insertion, discussion of strategies for optimizing the listening-learning environment for children with OME, and ongoing counseling and education of parents/caregiver; risks, harms, costs are the cost of examination(s). The surveillance interval is intentionally vague and is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months, and "significant" hearing loss is broadly defined as one that is noticed by the caregiver, reported by the child, or interferes in school performance or quality of life, and there is a role for patient (caregiver) preferences with opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval. Quality improvement opportunity items include promoting continuity of care, avoiding preventable complications through surveillance, and gaining insight into natural history of chronic middle ear fluid.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^116E8E4w]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To investigate whether radiologist-produced imaging reports containing the terms mastoiditis or mastoid opacification clinically correlate with physical examination findings of mastoiditis. Additionally, to investigate whether and how often otolaryngology was unnecessarily consulted and inappropriate antibiotic therapy was initiated.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review within a large community hospital setting.

Methods

A retrospective review of 160 patients who had imaging tests performed for nonotolaryngology indications from January 2011 to March 2017 at our facility. Indications, patient demographics, otolaryngology consultations, and new antibiotics started were recorded. Physical examinations were documented.

Results

Physical examination revealed that only 14 of 160 patients (8.8%) had clinical evidence of otologic disease. However, of the 160 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 18 (11.3%) received an otolaryngology consultation, and 18 (11.3%) had antibiotics started. Eleven of the 18 patients in each group (61.1%) had a normal physical examination, two (11.1%) had serous otitis media, one (5.6%) had chronic otitis media, and four (22.2%) had acute otitis media. No patients were found to have clinical mastoiditis. χ² analysis revealed no significance in the radiologic diagnosis of mastoiditis versus mastoid opacification in relation to physicians requesting otolaryngology consultations (P = 0.241) or starting patients on antibiotics (P = 0.951).

Conclusions

This study highlights the prevalence of incidental but clinically insignificant opacification of the mastoid cavity. We believe that nonotolaryngology physicians are, overall, competent to correlate such radiologic findings clinically and to prevent unnecessary consultations and inappropriate treatment, which add significant costs to our overstretched healthcare system.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1131Dqsw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — otitis media with effusion (OME) key action statements specify that clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old and state that adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Otitis media with effusion [^117WBZDL]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media. The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should 1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME, 2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk, and 3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that 4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME, 5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected, and 6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate (tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure). Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that 1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children, and 2) because antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME, they should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that 1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and 2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery) and provide additional relevant information such as history of acute otitis media and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for 1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME, based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy, or 2) allergy management as a treatment for OME, based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children more than 12 years old, because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child-development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### The role of allergy in otitis media with effusion [^1125kdnS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The role of allergy in chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is controversial. New evidence from cellular biology and immunology explain the basics of allergic reactions and allow more accurate diagnosis of allergies and inflammatory disease throughout the unified airway. This article examines the epidemiologic, methodological, and immunologic studies of allergic causes of OME, including (1) evidence for and against OME as an allergic disease, (2) allergy as a cause for eustachian tube obstruction, (3) examination of the most sensitive diagnostic tests for allergy, and (4) the effect of treatment of underlying allergies in improving and resolving middle ear disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115UnMJU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) — Tympanostomy tubes for symptomatic cases is presented as an option for symptoms not limited to balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life, and is described as an "Option based on randomized controlled trials and before-and-after studies with a balance between benefit and harm". Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C. Level of confidence in evidence is high for vestibular problems and quality of life and medium for poor school performance, behavioral problems, and ear discomfort. Reported benefits include reduced prevalence of middle ear effusion (MEE), possible relief of symptoms attributed to chronic OME, and elimination of MEE as a confounding factor. If surgery is performed, risks and costs include anesthesia risks; sequelae of indwelling tympanostomy tubes such as otorrhea, granulation tissue, and obstruction; complications after tube extrusion including myringosclerosis, retraction pocket, and persistent perforation; premature extrusion; retained tube; tympanostomy tube medialization; procedural anxiety and discomfort; and direct costs of surgery and follow-up care. The benefit-harm assessment is equilibrium, patient or caregiver preferences have a substantial role in shared decision making regarding whether to proceed with or decline tympanostomy tube insertion, the policy level is option, exceptions are none, and differences of opinion are none, with implementation considerations including availability of audiology and office-based assessment of behavior, speech, language, vestibular issues, and OME-related quality-of-life deficits.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^113odNCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic opacified middle ear: chronic inflammation/infection

Definition

When the inflammation persists at least 6 weeks and is associated with otorrhea through a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic otitis media (COM) is diagnosed.

Symptoms

These include conductive hearing loss, sometimes pain, vertigo, otorrhea.

Many patients with COM will undergo diagnostic imaging studies. Among main indications are:
Long-standing inflammation, unresponsive to medical treatment
Evaluation of possible causes of conductive hearing loss (ossicle erosion or fixation)
Clinical suspicion of cholesteatoma
Suspected intratemporal complications, such as petrositis, labyrinthitis, subperiosteal abscess, labyrinthine fistula
Suspected intracranial complications like brain abscess, meningitis

Preferable imaging methods

Both CT and MRI are used in the evaluation of COM and its complications. HRCT is the best tool to evaluate ossicular chain and tympanic cavity walls. However, CT is unable to differentiate between different types of effusions in the tympanic cavity, also evaluation of cholesteatoma can be challenging. MRI plays role in the detection of primary and residual cholesteatoma, also when intracranial and some intratemporal complications are suspected.

Since some ears with chronic inflammation develop cholesteatoma, COM may be classified into two groups: with or without cholesteatoma.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114VUpMQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — evidence-based recommendations for tympanostomy tube insertion specify that clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME) and symptoms attributable to OME (e.g., vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life); clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion (or OME) at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; and clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME). Recommendations against tube insertion are that clinicians should NOT perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of OME of < 3 mo of duration or in children with recurrent AOM who do not have middle ear effusion (or OME) in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy.

### Chronic otitis media with multiple complications [^116LN84F]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic otitis media (COM) is defined as persistent infection or inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid air cells. The proximity of the middle ear cleft and mastoid air cells to the intratemporal and intracranial compartments places structures located in these areas at increased risk of infectious complications. The complications of COM are divided into intracranial and extracranial complications. The development and appropriate use of antibiotics have led to a decrease in these potentially devastating complications. However, they continue to occur, and clinical vigilance is required for early detection and treatment. We reported a case with multiple complications, both intracranial and extracranial secondary to COM.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113KBbXm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) — Vestibular and developmental symptoms may justify considering tympanostomy tubes when symptoms are likely attributable to OME despite not meeting hearing-loss criteria. The statement's purpose is to facilitate intervention for children with chronic OME and associated symptoms likely attributable to OME when prior criteria are not met, and it notes United Kingdom guidance to "consider surgical intervention in children with chronic bilateral OME with a hearing loss less than 25 to 30 dB HL" when impact is significant. The group also considered chronic unilateral OME as a surgical indication if presented with symptoms likely attributable to OME. OME has "a direct and reversible impact on the vestibular system in children aged 3 years and older", with deficiencies that "tend to resolve promptly following tympanostomy tube insertion", and "evidence suggests that tympanostomy tube insertion is a reasonable option for children with chronic OME who have unexplained clumsiness, balance problems, or delayed motor development". For children "under the age of 3 years" the vestibular impact "has not been well studied", though improvement or resolution has been described after tube insertion.

### Otitis media [^11378QAH]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) or middle ear inflammation is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during 'colds', viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) monitoring: clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected.

Natural history and rationale — Once OME has persisted in both ears for 3 months or longer, the chance of spontaneous resolution is low: approximately 20% within 3 months, 25% after 6 months, and only 30% after 1 year of additional observation. Therefore, most children diagnosed with chronic bilateral OME will fail to improve in a timely fashion, even with prolonged observation. This low probability of resolution creates a need to assess the impact of persistent effusion on a child's QOL and functional health status.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

### Otitis media and ear tubes [^117MwwfT]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The placement of myringotomy tubes remains an effective treatment of recurrent acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion. Infants and young children are prone to these entities because of their immature anatomy and immunology. Several host, pathogenic, and environmental factors contribute to the development of these conditions. The identification and modification of some these factors can preclude the need for intervention. The procedure continues to be one of the most common outpatient pediatric procedures. Close vigilance and identification of potential complications is of utmost importance in the ongoing management of the child with middle ear disease.

### Determinants of chronic otitis media with effusion in preschool children: a case-control study [^1123KDfv]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a childhood condition where fluid gathers behind the tympanic membrane. OME is a common reason for doctors' visits, antibiotic use and surgery. Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), defined as effusion lasting 3 or more months, causes hearing loss that may lead to learning delays and behavioural problems.

COME is caused by bacteria and viruses entering the middle ear from the upper respiratory tract, leading to a chronic inflammatory response. COME chronicity may be explained by the formation of biofilms in the middle ear. Biofilms are sessile communities of microorganisms that can evade the host's immune system and are often resistant to antibiotic treatment. Risk factors associated with COME include young age, ethnicity, family history, breastfeeding practices, exposure to other children, and upper respiratory infection (URI). Acute otitis media (AOM) and OME often follow each other, and can be viewed as aspects of a disease continuum.

While many risk factors for COME have been reported, there is a lack of recent research in which a wide range of potential determinants and confounders are considered together. The aim of the study was to examine a comprehensive array of variables, including prenatal and perinatal factors for which research is lacking, to identify risk factors that are independently associated with COME.

### Chronic otitis media in children: an evidence-based guide for diagnosis and management [^115BQChm]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To provide an easy-to-follow evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the management of chronic otitis media (COM) in children.

Materials/Methods

Literature review and critical analysis of the available evidence in Medline and other scientific database sources.

Data Synthesis

Otorrhea and hearing loss are the cardinal symptoms of COM, while oto-microscopy and imaging techniques can confirm the diagnosis. Conservative treatment is acceptable to some extent (i.e. mild cases of COM without cholesteatoma). It involves topical drops (quinolones as first choice drugs- strength of recommendation B), as well as performing aural toilet (strength of recommendation B), and avoiding water ingress. Tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy is expected to improve hearing in cases of non-cholesteatomatous COM (strength of recommendation C), and positively affect the children's quality of life (strength of recommendation B). Less experienced surgeons and inflamed, wet middle ear mucosa represent the two most important factors, which could lead to reperforations (strength of recommendation C). The surgical management of COM with cholesteatoma tends to employ the least invasive surgical technique, in order to obtain a small self-cleaning mastoid cavity, as well as good hearing results (strength of recommendation C).

Conclusion

The treatment of choice in most cases of pediatric COM is surgery. Figure 1 proposes a detailed and easy-to-follow evidence-based algorithm with regard to the diagnosis and management of COM in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116aLddA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgery — shared decision making and age-based procedure selection emphasizes that there are 2 aspects of decision making (surgery vs additional observation, and procedure selection), candidacy depends on hearing status, associated symptoms, developmental risk, and anticipated chance of spontaneous resolution, and the poorest spontaneous resolution occurs when effusion is chronic (≥ 3 months) or associated with a type B (flat curve) tympanogram; once surgery is chosen, shared decision making is limited for children < 4 years old because tympanostomy tubes are recommended, whereas in children ≥ 4 years old options include tympanostomy tube placement alone (offers the most reliable short- and intermediate-term resolution of hearing loss and caregivers of at-risk children perceive large improvements after tube placement), adenoidectomy alone (offers comparable OME control to tubes at 6 and 12 months but may be less reliable in the short term, reduces the need for repeat surgery, has more potential anesthetic- and procedure-related complications, and some children may need additional surgery for tympanostomy tube insertion), adenoidectomy plus myringotomy without tubes (has outcomes comparable to tubes with less otorrhea and tympanic membrane sequelae, but tympanostomy tube insertion offers more reliable short-term effusion resolution and middle ear ventilation and is preferable when potential relapse must be minimized or when pronounced inflammation is present), and adenoidectomy plus tympanostomy tube placement (offers combined benefits, especially reducing repeat surgery in children with a history of tympanostomy tube placement, and may benefit children with nasal obstruction or recurrent sinonasal infections insufficient alone to justify adenoidectomy).

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — hearing thresholds, monitoring, and tympanostomy tube decisions are tied to audiologic findings and effusion duration. If a child with OME has hearing levels in the normal range (< 15 dB HL), the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option, and if watchful waiting is continued a repeat hearing test should be performed in 3 to 6 months if OME persists. If a child with OME has mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) and bilateral effusions for 3 months or longer (chronic), the clinician should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion; if mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) occurs with a unilateral effusion or with bilateral effusions for less than 3 months, the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option. If a child with OME has moderate hearing loss (> 40 dB HL), tympanostomy tube insertion should be recommended. Reevaluation at 3- to 6-month intervals should include otologic examination, with audiologic assessment as needed, and any child with evidence of hearing loss on screening or hearing testing should be referred for comprehensive audiologic evaluation by a licensed audiologist in a sound-treated booth. One systematic review showed early improvement in hearing levels after tympanostomy tube placement at postoperative 1–3 months, but by 12 to 24 months hearing outcomes were equivalent to watchful waiting, and randomized trials suggest that otherwise healthy children with persistent OME who do not have any of the at-risk criteria in Table 2 can be safely observed for 6 to 12 months without developmental sequelae or reduced overall QOL. Ongoing surveillance is mandatory because the incidence of structural damage increases with effusion duration.

INTRODUCTION

Otitis media (OM) is a common inflammatory condition of the middle ear that predominantly affects children. With more than 700 million cases annually, OM accounts for a majority of pediatric emergency department visits and antibiotic prescriptions worldwide. OM presents itself as a continuum of symptoms with acute or chronic characteristics. Acute otitis media (AOM) is associated with an abrupt onset, considerable pain, and clear signs of infection and inflammation in the middle ear (ME). In contrast, otitis media with effusion (OME), is defined as a chronic and low-grade inflammation of the ME, without signs of acute infection (e.g. no fever or earache) and with nonpurulent effusion persisting in the ME for more than 3 months. This prolonged accumulation of effusion causes a conductive hearing loss, which makes OME the most common cause of reversible hearing loss in children. If untreated, it may over time lead to speech delay, as well as cognitive and developmental problems. OME can occur as a sequela of AOM, but the precise pathogenesis is still not fully understood, including the mechanisms contributing to initiation, continuation, and spontaneous resolution of inflammation, as well as the relative roles and the interplay of the microbiota (pathogens and normal flora), the host immune response, and other host characteristics.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1126XHCh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common terms — defines tympanostomy tube insertion, otitis media categories, and related ear findings with explicit thresholds. Tympanostomy tube insertion is surgical placement through a myringotomy for temporary middle ear ventilation, and tubes generally last several months to several years, with synonyms including ventilation tubes, pressure equalization (PE) tubes, grommets (UK), and bilateral myringotomy and tubes (BMT). Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is OME persisting for 3 months or longer from onset or diagnosis. Persistent acute otitis media (AOM) includes relapse of AOM within 1 month after completing antibiotics, and when 2 episodes of otitis media occur within 1 month it may be difficult to distinguish recurrence from persistence. AOM is the rapid onset of middle-ear inflammation diagnosed by a distinctly bulging tympanic membrane with a middle ear effusion; OME is fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of AOM, and middle ear effusion (MEE) refers to fluid in the middle ear often from OME and during or after AOM. Tympanostomy tube otorrhea is discharge from the middle ear through the tube, a retraction pocket is a collapsed area of the tympanic membrane with sharp demarcation, and a tympanogram is an objective measure of tympanic membrane vibration and pressure, with a flat tracing if the middle ear is filled with fluid and a peak shifted based on pressure (left if negative, right if positive).

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to adenoidectomy, AAO-HNSF, AAO-HNS 2016 guidelines recommend to do not perform adenoidectomy in < 4 years old patients with OME unless a distinct indication (such as nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis) exists.

### Sensorineural hearing loss after otitis media with effusion and subacute mastoiditis after viral infections of the upper respiratory tract: a comparative study of conservative and surgical treatment [^117KhPAP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Involvement of the middle ear after viral infections of the upper airways may lead to serous otitis media with effusion in the absence of bacterial infection. This can be accompanied by a concomitant shading of the mastoid air cells, which could manifest as a reduced opacity on computed tomography (CT) in the absence of a history of chronic mastoiditis or acute inflammatory signs. This can lead to a subsequent impairment of inner ear function. CT scans reveal an extended pneumatization of the temporal bones in affected patients. Inner ear hearing impairment can probably be attributed to a concomitant labyrinthine reaction-the so-called toxic inner ear lesion. If no remission occurs within 5 days after initial conservative treatment (paracentesis or hemorrheologic infusions), surgical treatment with a mastoidectomy can accelerate hearing restoration. We conducted a retrospective, nonrandomized study of short- and long-term hearing outcomes in patients with a toxic inner ear lesion who had been treated with conservative measures alone (CONS group) or with surgery (SURG group) in a tertiary care referral center. Our study group was made up of 52 consecutively presenting patients (57 ears) who had been seen over a 10-year period; there were 20 patients (21 ears) in the CONS group and 32 patients (36 ears) in the SURG group. Initially, 15 CONS patients (75%) and 18 SURG patients (56%) complained of dizziness or a balance disorder. The initial averaged sensorineural hearing loss (over 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 kHz) was 32.4 ± 15.6 dB in the CONS group and 35.4 ± 12.0 dB in the SURG group. At follow-up (mean: 31.7 mo), the SURG group experienced a significantly greater improvement in hearing (p = 0.025). We conclude that patients with viral otitis media and concomitant noninflammatory mastoiditis with impairment of inner ear function (sensorineural hearing loss) experience a better hearing outcome when a mastoidectomy is performed during primary treatment.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^115dxUzg]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Middle ear

The middle ear is hidden behind the tympanic membrane, what makes direct non-invasive evaluation limited in many cases.

Although the pathology itself can be well estimated on otoscopic examination, further questions concerning the extent of the disease, exact location, structures involved and possible bone erosion, will be addressed in detail only with CT and/or MRI.

The majority of everyday practice cases will consist of inflammatory diseases, either chronic or acute, and sometimes tumours. On CT examination, these entities will demonstrate a mass, or a diffuse opacification of middle ear cavity.

Since an opacified middle ear is a common finding on imaging studies, a practical classification has been used, in order to facilitate differential diagnosis (Table 3).

Chronic OME — hearing surveillance and audiologic thresholds: Periodic assessment of hearing status is an important aspect of surveillance, and hearing loss has been defined by conventional audiometry as a loss > 20-dB HL at ≥ 1 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) and requires a comprehensive audiologic evaluation; if hearing levels are in the normal range (HL ≤ 20 dB), a repeat hearing test should be performed in 3 to 6 months if OME persists, whereas for mild hearing loss (HL, 21–39 dB) or moderate (or greater) hearing loss (HL ≥ 40 dB), a comprehensive audiologic evaluation is indicated if one has not already been done; in addition, all children with specified tympanic membrane conditions, regardless of OME duration, should have a comprehensive audiologic evaluation typically including air and bone conduction thresholds and speech audiometry.

Mastoiditis is a common clinical entity that is technically present in all cases of otitis media; only a minority of cases actually represents the otolaryngologic emergency of acute coalescent mastoiditis. When reviewing an image with a radiologic diagnosis of mastoiditis, looking for key signs such as destruction of bony septa and considering patient presentation can help distinguish mild mastoiditis from acute coalescent mastoiditis.

### Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on otitis media with effusion in children: future therapeutic implications [^115BYjSY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME), also known as serous or secretory otitis media, is one of the most frequent diseases in childhood. An estimated 80% of all children have had at least 1 episode of OME by the age of 10 years, with a peak of prevalence in the first 2 years of life. It is characterized by the presence of fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane, without signs and symptoms of acute infection, and it is defined as chronic when the middle ear effusion persists for > 3 months.

OME is commonly a self-limiting condition, but it can be recurrent and chronic in approximately one-third and one-quarter of affected children, respectively. Chronic OME is potentially associated with conductive hearing loss and middle ear complications, often leading to speech and behavioral problems and poor school performance. It represents the most common cause of hearing impairment in children in the developed world, negatively affecting quality of life.

The high prevalence of OME in young children has been associated with the anatomic and functional immaturity of the eustachian tube, the higher rate of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) due to exposure to viruses and bacteria in day care centers, and the often concomitant hypertrophy of the adenoid tissue. The forced isolation of children at home during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has provided an opportunity to verify the impact of nonattendance at day care centers and schools on the prevalence of OME.

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of OME before and after the national lockdown on all activities and to determine the influence of social isolation on the natural history of chronic OME in children who attended the pediatric outpatient audiology clinic.

### Chronic otitis media with effusion in chronic sinusitis with polyps [^115kmn9L]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The relationship between otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) remains unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 80 consecutively presenting patients-42 males and 38 females, aged 15 to 76 years (median: 48)-who were diagnosed with CRSwNP. Our aim was to ascertain the prevalence of OME in CRSwNP patients, to determine whether the severity of CRSwNP affected OME, and to identify risk factors for OME in CRSwNP patients. The severity of CRSwNP was assessed on the basis of nasal symptoms, endoscopic nasal examinations, and Lund-Mackay staging scores. In addition to demographic data, we obtained information on each patient's history of otitis, otoscopic findings, and the results of pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry. We then compared the data between CRSwNP patients with OME (n = 20) and those without (n = 60). In the OME group, a conductive hearing loss was present in 16 patients (80.0%); all patients in the control group had normal hearing. With regard to symptoms, only rhinorrhea appeared to be more common in patients with OME than in those without, although the difference was not statistically significant. We found no significant difference in nasal polyposis grades between the two groups. Also, we found no correlations between the risk of OME and previous surgical treatment, asthma, allergy, aspirin intolerance, aspirin and/or NSAID intolerance, aspirin and/or sulfite intolerance, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Based on our findings, we conclude that OME occurs frequently during the evolution of CRSwNP, even when the nasal disease is well controlled. This finding suggests the possible presence, in OME and/or CRSwNP, of a global inflammatory process that involves the epithelium in both the middle ear and upper airway.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — strength of action terms and implied obligation defines three categories. Strong recommendation: the quality of the supporting evidence is high (grade A or B), and Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation: the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C), and Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences and modifying factors. Option: either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

Impact on children and families — otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of hearing impairment in children in developed nations, and permanent hearing loss related to otitis media has a prevalence of 2 to 35 per 10,000. The impact on disease-specific quality of life (QOL) and functional health status may be substantial for children and caregivers. Symptom burden is high: prospectively measured parental reports indicate 76% experience otalgia, 64% sleep disruption, 49% behavioral problems, 33% to 62% speech and hearing concerns, and 15% balance symptoms. OME also raises the rate of acute otitis media up to 5 times higher than when effusion is absent.

Achondroplasia — ear, nose and throat (ENT) care and hearing: Children "should have a comprehensive audiological assessment at birth, as indicated by signs and symptoms or in any case no later than 5 years of age", and those with "speech delay, hearing difficulties, and/or signs and symptoms of middle ear effusion should be referred to an ENT specialist". Adults and children "frequently have hearing loss and middle ear disease", so clinicians "should evaluate eardrums and ask about hearing difficulties as part of regular health maintenance to guide appropriate referrals". For chronic eustachian tube dysfunction with middle ear effusions and conductive hearing loss, tympanostomy tube placement "can be recommended when middle ear effusions are present for 3 or more months and hearing loss is documented". "Amplification with hearing aids can be offered" for hearing loss, including conductive loss from middle ear disease. Because high jugular bulb in the middle ear is more common, clinicians should check for otoscopic signs of high jugular bulb before myringotomy or other otological procedures are performed.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^115S54w7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Literature review

Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by signs and symptoms of pressure dysregulation in the middle ear such as 'aural fullness', 'popping', discomfort, pain or 'under water sensation'and represents a common problem with reported incidences ranging from 0.9% to 5%.

According to Schilder et al, the three subtypes of Eustachian tube dysfunction include barochallenge-induced dysfunction in conditions of alteration of the ambient pressure, patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction and dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction. The latter can be broken down into functional obstruction, dynamic dysfunction due to muscular failure and anatomical obstruction.

Acute episodes are often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection, or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, which causes inflammation in the Eustachian tube orifice or lumen. Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by symptoms lasting for more than 3 months and has been associated with damage to the middle ear and the eardrum. Complications include otitis media with effusion (glue ear), middle ear atelectasis (retraction of the eardrum) and chronic otitis media with defects of the tympanic membrane. Consequently, it must be considered the primary cause of herniation of the tympanic membrane.

We found the earliest mention referring to a 'hernia of the tympanic membrane' dating back to 4 November 1932. In a written protocol of a case discussion in 'The Section of Otology' a 24-year-old male patient was presented, who reported otorrhea from childhood up to the age of 17, which then dried up. Seven years later, the ear discharged again for several days. On examination, the right drum was red and bulging, but painless and without inflammation. Hearing by air conduction was reduced. Decades before the possibility to perform cross-sectional imaging, the authors discussed the following questions. 'Is this a hernia of the middle layer of the drum, or is it a cholesteatoma, and if so, is the radical mastoid operation justifiable in view of the fact that the only symptom of the patient is deafness in the right ear? Should one perform paracentesis?' They agreed on performing a conventional anteroposterior view radiography of the petrous bone, which showed no bony abnormalities. A subsequently performed paracentesis revealed 'very thick tenacious mucus'. The final diagnosis in this case remains unknown.

### Mastoid obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass versus mastoidectomy alone for refractory chronic suppurative otitis media [^114fLR35]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Technique

In all cases, a mastoidectomy was performed. All visible infected and inflamed mucosas were removed, and the ossicular chain was assessed. If necessary, the ossicular chain would be reconstructed. The tympanic membrane would be reconstructed using cartilage, fascia, or combination grafts. In few cases, preoperatively placed tympanostomy tubes were left in situ or microperforations were not closed to increase aeration of the middle ear and prevent effusion to occur. In obliteration cases, the mastoid cavity, and if the ossicular chain was not present the epitympanum, would be filled with S53P4 BAG granules that were moistened using sterile saline. Soluble materials such as sterile hemostatic gelatine sponges or cartilage were used to separate the BAG obliteration from the middle ear space. The decision whether to obliterate was made based on several parameters. The main reason was the year of surgery, as obliteration was not performed in 2010 and only gradually introduced in our practice since 2011. In the earlier years, the obliteration technique would be reserved for revision operations or particularly challenging cases as the added value of obliteration was still unclear in 2011. Other reasons were the specific surgeon's preference and the age of the patient. At first, our team was cautious to obliterate pediatric cases but, as it appeared that the material had no adverse effects, all cases that undergo mastoidectomy are now obliterated, regardless of age. Postoperatively, patients would be followed at our outpatient clinic at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. If a patient remained free of symptoms during this period, they would be followed annually at our outpatient clinic.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^111kmBRZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to hearing test, AAO-HNSF, AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a hearing evaluation if OME persists for ≥ 3 months, and before surgery if a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion.

### Acute mastoiditis… [^114f2XQj]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Thirty children with acute mastoiditis were identified over a 12-year-period and their hospital records were reviewed retrospectively. All had abnormal tympanic membranes and 26 had swelling above or posterior to the ear that deviated the pinna. Findings on mastoid roentgenograms included clouding and osteitis; six were normal. From 13 patients, bacteria were recovered from normally sterile sites and included Pneumococcus, group A streptococcus, Haemophilus, and anaerobes. Complications occurred in 13 children, including subperiosteal abscess, meningitis, osteitis, facial palsy, and subdural empyema and brain abscess. Four of the six children with neurological complications had no external signs of acute mastoiditis on physical examination. Overall, 19 of the children recovered without mastoidectomy.

We conclude that children without meningitis or subperiosteal abscess may be treated initially with antimicrobial therapy plus myringotomy. The need for mastoidectomy should be reassessed in children who fail to respond in 24 to 48 hours. Ogle JW, Lauer BA. Acute Mastoiditis: Diagnosis and Complications.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^117M7f33]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up and middle ear effusion (MEE): There is little scientific evidence for a routine 10- to 14-day reevaluation visit for all children with an episode of AOM. Persistent MEE is common and can be detected by pneumatic otoscopy (with or without verification by tympanometry) after resolution of acute symptoms, with 60% to 70% of children having MEE at two weeks after successful antibiotic treatment, decreasing to 40% at 1 month and 10% to 25% at 3 months. The presence of MEE without clinical symptoms is defined as otitis media with effusion (OME), which must be differentiated clinically from AOM and requires infrequent additional monitoring but not antibiotic therapy.

### Panel 1: epidemiology and diagnosis [^114V11Cn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To create a literature review between 2011 and June 1, 2015, on advances in otitis media (OM) epidemiology and diagnosis (including relevant audiology studies). Data Sources Electronic search engines (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) with a predefined search strategy. Review Methods Articles with appropriate epidemiologic methodology for OM, including acute mastoiditis and eustachian tube dysfunction. Items included OM worldwide and in high-risk populations, OM-related hearing loss, news in OM diagnostics, prenatal risk factors and comorbidities, postnatal risk factors, genetics, microbiological epidemiology, guidelines, and quality of life. Conclusions Diagnostic evidence and genetic studies are increasing; guidelines are introduced worldwide; and there is evidence of benefit of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. New risk factors and comordities are identified in the study period, and quality of life is affected in children and their families. Implications for Practice Chronic suppurative OM occurs worldwide and contributes to lifelong hearing loss. Uniform definitions are still lacking and should be provided. An association between HIV and chronic suppurative OM has been found. Tympanometry is recommended for diagnosis, with or without pneumatic otoscopy. Video otoscopy, algorithms, and validated questionnaires may assist clinicians. Childhood obesity is associated with OM. Heritability accounts for 20% to 50% of OM diagnoses. OM-prone children seem to produce weaker immunologic responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Clinicians tend to individualize treatment without adhering to guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^114LmLKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Dosimetric analysis for otitis media with effusion due to eustachian tube dysfunction after carbon-ion radiation therapy for head and neck cancers [^111HD218]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a major concerning adverse event for patients with head and neck cancers treated with radiation therapy (RT), producing various clinical symptoms, such as earache, chronic purulent secretion, tinnitus, hearing loss, and reduced quality of life. Approximately 10% to 30% of patients with head and neck cancer treated with RT developed OME. There are 2 potential mechanisms for OME development:Eustachian tube dysfunction and direct radiation-induced damage of the middle ear cavity and/or mastoid cell mucosa. Several articles report on the association between dosimetric factors and OME in RT.,

Compared with photons, carbon ions are characterized by higher linear energy transfer and greater values of relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Carbon ions also have improved dose localization properties due to the Bragg peak and small lateral scattering. Therefore, carbon-ion RT (CIRT) has been effective against radioresistant tumors due to its high biological effectiveness and high dose irradiation. Moreover, CIRT can deliver doses consistent with the irradiation field, and is expected to reduce adverse events, especially by improving the surrounding medium dose area (Fig. 1). In the head and neck regions, CIRT can be used to irradiate deep tumors, such as sinonasal and pharyngeal tumors, with reduced doses to the mastoid cells and middle ear, but we encountered a case of OME due to Eustachian tube dysfunction where the tumor was in close proximity. However, there are no reports on the risk factors for OME due to Eustachian tube dysfunction in CIRT, and dose constraints on the Eustachian tube are unknown.

Figure 1
Example of otitis media with effusion after carbon-ion radiation therapy (RT). A 40-year-old woman was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxillary sinus. Six months after receiving carbon-ion RT, grade 3 otitis media with effusion was observed. A-F) Contouring of the cartilage part (red), bone part (blue), and mastoid cell (green); G) representative dose distribution of carbon-ion RT, with a prescribed dose of 64.0 Gy (relative biological effectiveness)/16 fractions; H) T2-weighted image before carbon-ion RT; and I) T2-weighted image 6 months after carbon-ion RT.

This study aimed to determine the predictive factors for OME related to Eustachian tube dysfunction in patients treated with CIRT for head and neck cancers.

### Mastoiditis on MRI: fact or artifact? [^11426KN9]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Fluid signal in the mastoid can be an incidental finding on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and often is interpreted as mastoiditis by radiologists. This study examines 28 consecutive cases of such erroneously diagnosed "mastoiditis" and documents the presence or absence of otologic symptoms and clinical signs. We found a very low prevalence of otologic symptoms or pathology and no cases of mastoiditis in these patients, and we determined that magnetic resonance imaging is not an effective screening modality for mastoiditis. We also reviewed the literature on current diagnostic criteria for mastoiditis and propose alternative terminology to replace the use of excessively alarming terms such as "mastoiditis" unless they apply to that specific clinical diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116PfbT7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — clinical role and risk considerations — state that when children receive surgery for otitis media with effusion (OME), insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the preferred initial procedure, with candidacy dependent primarily on hearing status, associated symptoms, and the child's developmental risk. Placement of tympanostomy tubes significantly reduces middle ear effusion (MEE) prevalence, resolves hearing loss caused by MEE, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy should acute tube otorrhea occur. Tympanostomy tubes also can improve disease-specific quality of life (QOL) for children with chronic OME, recurrent AOM, or both. Risks and potential adverse events are related to general anesthesia, usually required for the procedure, and the effects of the tympanostomy tube on the tympanic membrane and middle ear, but risks associated with general anesthesia can be eliminated by inserting tubes in the office setting without general anesthesia, when appropriate, based on shared decision making between the clinician and family.

### The therapeutic use of exosomes in children with adenoid hypertrophy accompanied by otitis media with effusion (AHOME): a protocol study [^113ttcdJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media, also known as middle ear inflammation, is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, and otitis media with effusion (OME). OME was first described by Politzerzai in 1867 as a non-suppurative inflammatory disease in the middle ear characterized by hearing loss caused by loss of transduction of sound waves in the middle ear due to the presence of middle ear effusion. OME is very common and is one of the main causes of hearing loss in children, and about 80% of children suffer one or more episodes of OME by 10 years of age. However, because of its inconspicuous symptoms, the incidence and prevalence are difficult to establish accurately, which is a significant obstacle to the prevention and treatment of OME. Treatment for OME includes enhancement of middle ear ventilation and drainage, removal of middle ear fluid, infection management, and treatment of related conditions. For children with OME without high-risk factors, there should be a 3-month watchful waiting period after diagnosis. Routine systemic use of antibiotics and hormones is not recommended, and there is a lack of long-term evidence for the efficacy of nasal corticosteroids and antihistamines. Current therapies, whether surgical or non-surgical, can temporarily alleviate ear cavity aeration, but the disease's natural course, long-term prognosis, and relapse rate remain unclear. For tympanostomy tubes, most of the important considerations are the impact of OME on children's social interactions and learning ability. There are no uniform recommendations for the indication of adenoidectomy in national guidelines, and the age of the child and whether there is a recurrence are important factors to consider.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1155zK4m]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Topical intranasal corticosteroids have evidence of efficacy from several small clinical trials, as well as theoretical reasons to support further evaluation. Anti-inflammatory effects on the post-nasal space, the peritubal lymphatic tissue, and encroaching adenoids have all been suggested. Although oral steroids may have some benefit in otitis media with effusion, their use for a chronic relapsing condition of childhood is generally precluded by the possibility of severe idiosyncratic and growth retardation effects. Thus, although many doctors may be using intranasal corticosteroids in preference to oral steroids for safety reasons, more research is needed to establish their clinical effectiveness when given as an adjunct to active monitoring in an affected cohort of children.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^111V3q59]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — strong recommendations state that the update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child and should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy and should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME, should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME, and should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.

Otitis media with effusion — observation period and exceptions are characterized as follows: Risks, harms, and costs include "Delays in therapy for OME that persists for > 3 months, prolongation of hearing loss", while the benefit-harm assessment is a "Preponderance of benefit over harm". Patient preference has a "Small" role. Exceptions specify that "At-risk children… may be offered tympanostomy tubes earlier than 3 months if there is a type B tympanogram in one or both ears". The policy level is "Strong recommendation", with "Intentional vagueness: None" and value judgments emphasizing "avoiding interventions in an often self-limited condition".

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^113ikDaj]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings show that three months' use of topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children seems to be no better than placebo in improving clearance of effusions of otitis media at one, three, and nine months, or in improving important symptom related outcomes. This is an important and under-researched area of child health, as evidence for the use of promising non-surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion is lacking. Otitis media with effusion is a common chronic problem seen in primary care, for which no effective treatment exists in this setting and which often leads to referral and surgery.

This UK-wide primary care study is the largest double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of topical intranasal corticosteroids in children with otitis media with effusion from any health setting; it is larger than the only previous randomised controlled trial from primary care that evaluated antibiotics. Follow-up rates were high, and we did not impute missing results (which would provide even more conservative findings than this analysis so would not alter the inferences). The results should thus be both relevant and generalisable to most children seen in the NHS.

This study used an objective outcome that evaluated efficacy in clearing bilateral effusions at one month. Although several small studies have suggested efficacy for topical nasal steroids, and they are often used off-licence for this condition, efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated in the literature. The risk difference (measured in children rather than ears) was 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3 to 18.1) in favour of placebo. The main findings show that the adjusted relative risks were less than 1 at one and nine months, indicating that placebo did better in both the short and longer term.

This study has shown that when an active monitoring scheme (sometimes called watchful waiting) is used in primary care, almost half of children will spontaneously clear the fluid from at least one of their ears by as soon as one month, and thus considerably reduce their risk of disability.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115gn8V7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to adenoidectomy, AAO-HNSF, AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion in pediatric patients with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) or in ≥ 4 years old patients to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.

### Chronic external otitis [^115PB74s]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic external otitis is probably a disease of mixed etiology; infection and hypersensitivity both play an important role. As such, these two components must be recognized and respected. Steroids are the mainstay of medical management. Antibiotics should be used cautiously and probably on an intermittent basis. The disease appears to be exacerbated by any manipulation of the canal, including aggressive cleansing. Medical therapy will slow the development of fibrosis in some cases, but it does not always prevent it. Once stenosis has progressed to the point that conductive hearing loss develops, surgery will restore hearing and prevent restenosis in at least 80% of cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion [^114EDL2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk; and (3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that (4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME; (5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; and (6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy, with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that (1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children and (2) antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME and should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that (1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and (2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery), and provide additional relevant information such as history of AOM and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for (1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy and (2) allergy management as a treatment for OME based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children older than 12 years because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^111kuJPi]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Ears, nose and throat

Individuals with CdLS typically have low-set, hairy and malformed ears, and one-third have small and stenotic ear canals. Inspection of the eardrum using the common small paediatric speculum is frequently difficult, thus cerumen removal or middle ear evaluation may require sedation for a complete assessment.

Middle and inner ear abnormalities in individuals with CdLS include malformed ossicles, especially the malleus and incus, small mastoids, cochlear abnormalities, malformed vestibules and soft-tissue opacification of the tympanomastoid cavity. Findings on temporal bone computed tomography, especially soft tissue in the middle ear, correlate well with audiometric data, and imaging studies are useful to assess the cause of hearing loss.

Hearing loss is very common (85–90%) in individuals with CdLS. It is typically bilateral, present in infancy, ranges from mild to severe (40–50%)and is sensorineural in 25% and conductive in 75%(R39). In adults, sensorineural hearing loss is reported in 45% of individuals with CdLS.

Conductive hearing loss is often secondary to persistent otitis media with effusion (80–85%), and canal stenosis is present in 30% of individuals with CdLS. Chronic or serous ear infection (otitis media) and chronic sinusitis are common (39%) in adulthood(R40). Initial evaluation of children with CdLS should include standard audiometric testing, plus otoacoustic emissions testing, auditory brainstem evoked response audiometry, or both, to assess for auditory neuropathies. Early identification of hearing loss is critical to maximize communication skills. Hearing has been reported to improve with time in 50% of adults with CdLS, including those with severe hearing loss. These findings indicate longitudinal evaluations of hearing.

### Radiological imaging of rare intracranial complications secondary to otitis media and mastoiditis [^113Ag24f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media used to cause fatal results because of its intracranial complications before the introduction of potent and effective antibiotics. After the introduction of antibiotics, complications have started to be observed more frequently as a result of chronic otitis media and especially in children. Because clinical findings changed and became indistinct, the diagnosis of otitis and mastoiditis has been made occasionally with imaging findings only after complications occurred. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are efficient and sufficient methods in the rapid diagnosis and should be immediately referred methods.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^111AvrGE]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion (OME) — definition and epidemiology in children: OME is defined as fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, whereas acute otitis media (AOM), usually lasting two to three weeks, is a middle ear infection of recent onset with symptoms and signs of infection such as fever, pain and irritability. OME may occur spontaneously due to Eustachian tube dysfunction or as an inflammatory response to AOM. Middle ear effusion may account for more than 90% of all middle ear pathology in children. Approximately 90% of children have OME at some time before entering school, most often between six months and four years of age. Fifty percent of children will experience OME in their first year of life, and more than 60% will have experienced the disease by two years of age.

### Chronic suppurative otitis media… [^117CTaAn]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media causes recurrent or persistent discharge through a perforation in the tympanic membrane, and can lead to thickening of the middle ear mucosa and mucosal polyps. It usually occurs as a complication of persistent acute otitis media with perforation in childhood. Cholesteatoma is an abnormal accumulation of squamous epithelium usually found in the middle ear cavity and mastoid process of the temporal bone. Granulation tissue and ear discharge are often associated with secondary infection of the desquamating epithelium. Cholesteatoma can be congenital or acquired. If untreated, it may progressively enlarge and erode the surrounding structures. Definition Chronic suppurative otitis media is persistent inflammation of the middle ear or mastoid cavity. Synonyms include chronic otitis media, chronic mastoiditis, and chronic tympanomastoiditis.

Chronic suppurative otitis media is characterized by recurrent or persistent ear discharge over two to six weeks through a perforation of the tympanic membrane. Chronic suppurative otitis media usually begins as a complication of persistent AOM with perforation in childhood. Typical findings may also include thickened granular middle ear mucosa and mucosal polyps. Occasionally, chronic suppurative otitis media will be associated with a cholesteatoma within the middle ear. Cholesteatoma is an abnormal accumulation of squamous epithelium usually found in the middle ear cavity and mastoid process of the temporal bone. Granulation tissue and ear discharge are often associated with secondary infection of the desquamating epithelium. Cholesteatoma is most often detected by careful otoscopic examination in children or adults with persistent discharge that does not respond to treatment.

Most cholesteatomas are thought to occur as a complication of a retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane. They are associated with recurrent or persistent middle ear disease, family history, and craniofacial abnormalities. If untreated, a cholesteatoma may progressively enlarge and erode the surrounding structures. Less often, spread of infection may lead to life-threatening complications such as intracranial infections and acute mastoiditis. The frequency of serious complications fell from 20% in 1938 to 2. 5% in 1948 worldwide, and is currently estimated to be about
0. 7% to 3. 2% worldwide.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^112GxUXr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to tympanostomy (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to do not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in pediatric patients with a single episode of OME of < 3 months duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^117ABA3c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) research needs — watchful waiting: Priorities include defining the anticipated rate of spontaneous resolution of OME in infants and young children (existing data are limited primarily to children aged ≥ 2 years), conducting large-scale prospective cohort studies to obtain current data on spontaneous resolution of newly diagnosed OME of unknown prior duration (existing data are primarily from the late 1970s and early 1980s), developing prognostic indicators to identify the best candidates for watchful waiting, determining whether children with an OME duration exceeding 1 to 2 years have an increased risk of hearing loss, balance problems, discomfort, or other findings that would prompt intervention, and determining if the lack of impact from prompt insertion of tympanostomy tubes on speech and language outcomes seen in asymptomatic young children with OME can be generalized to older or symptomatic children with OME referred for evaluation.

### A sticky situation: case series of successful treatment of glue ear with dupilumab [^115Qy2MY]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To highlight the efficacy of dupilumab in treating chronic otitis media with effusion (glue ear).

Patients

Three patients with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) refractory to medical and surgical treatment were retrospectively identified. All patients had medical history suggestive of the presence of eosinophilic inflammation.

Interventions

Each patient received a 300-mg injection of dupilumab every 4 weeks for a total of three injections.

Main Outcome Measures

Audiometric data, patient-reported incidence of new ear infections, patient-reported symptoms.

Results

All patients reported subjective improvement in ear pain, drainage, and hearing loss between 2 weeks and 6 months on dupilumab therapy. In case 1 and case 2, audiograms showed some improvement in hearing loss posttreatment. Case 2 had an unexpected interruption of treatment for 4 weeks and reported return of thick ear drainage and difficulty with hearing.

Conclusions

Dupilumab may be a novel, effective, and nonsurgical treatment option for patients with chronic otitis media with effusion and underlying atopic conditions.

### Surgical management of chronic otitis media: beyond tympanotomy tubes [^113N8BUY]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic ear disease encompasses a wide range of clinical entities amenable to medical and surgical intervention. The otolaryngologist must always consider the goals of surgery — first and foremost to achieve a safe ear. The least invasive procedure capable of eradicating disease is generally chosen. During surgery, a delicate balance has to exist between the careful preservation of function and the aggressive prevention of potentially recurrent disease. Postoperatively, thorough follow-up and good judgment are paramount in avoiding complications and preventing unnecessary additional surgical procedures.

### Gravity and mastoid effusion [^117HVZdf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic mastoid effusions have recently been observed in astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight. In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6° head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response.

Methods

The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest.

Results

None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control).

Conclusions

Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation.

### Diagnosis and management of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid-middle ear effusion and otorrhea [^114wvba9]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Spontaneous leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the middle ear can occur in adults without a history of temporal bone trauma or fracture, meningitis, or any obvious cause. Therefore, clues may be lacking that would alert the otolaryngologist that fluid medial to an intact eardrum, or fluid emanating from an eardrum perforation, is likely to be CSF fluid. A review of relevant medical literature reveals that herniation of the arachnoid membrane through a tegmen defect may be congenital, or CSF leak may occur when dynamic factors (i.e., brain pulsations or increases in intracranial pressure) produce a rent in the arachnoid membrane. Because tegmen defects may be multiple rather than single, identifying only one defect may not be sufficient for achieving definitive repair. Data on nine cases of spontaneous CSF leak to the ear in adult patients from four medical centers are presented and analyzed to provide collective information about a disorder that can be difficult to diagnose and manage.

Study Design

Retrospective review of nine cases of spontaneous CSF middle ear effusion/otorrhea.

Results

The majority of patients presented with symptoms of aural fullness and middle ear effusion. Many developed suspicious clear otorrhea only after insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Two patients had multiple defects in the tegmen and dura, and five patients had meningoencephaloceles confirmed intraoperatively. Five patients underwent combined middle cranial fossa/transmastoid repair. Materials used in repair included temporalis fascia, free muscle graft, Oxycel cotton, calvarial bone, pericranium, bone wax, and fibrin glue.

Conclusions

CSF middle ear effusion/otorrhea can develop in adults without a prior history of meningitis or head trauma or any apparent proximate cause. Although presenting symptoms can be subtle, early suspicion and confirmatory imaging aid in establishing the diagnosis. Because surgical repair by way of a mastoid approach alone can be inadequate if there are multiple tegmen defects, a middle fossa approach alone, or in combination with a transmastoid approach, should be considered in most cases.

### Clinical strategies for the management of acute mastoiditis in the pediatric population [^112uGYYA]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of acute mastoiditis has been substantially reduced since the introduction of antibiotic therapy, mastoiditis complications are still commonly seen in the pediatric population. Many of these cases require lengthy hospitalizations and extensive medical and surgical interventions. Accordingly, a safe, effective, and resourceful diagnostic and therapeutic plan must be executed for the workup and treatment of each patient suspected of having acute mastoiditis. With thorough clinical evaluations, early diagnosis, and close follow-up, a large proportion of children with severe acute otitis media or early stage mastoiditis can be managed in the primary care setting without immediate surgical specialty involvement. This review presents an overview of the anatomical and pathophysiological considerations in acute mastoiditis and offers pediatricians a practical, evidence-based algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this disease.

### Emergency radiologic approach to mastoid air cell fluid [^115soK1a]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mastoid air cell fluid is a commonly seen, but often dismissed finding. Given the location of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone and its location adjacent to vital structures, a careful evaluation is important for the emergency radiologist. While occasionally benign, fluid within the mastoid air cells can be an early sign of more severe pathology, and familiarity of regional anatomy allows for early identification of disease spread. This article describes the important anatomy, the common pathologies, and a radiologic approach to assessing the mastoid air cells in order to guide referring clinicians.

### Assessing the prognostic value of the ChOLE classification in predicting the severity of acquired cholesteatoma [^112e7pW9]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Complications, "L"

The presence of complications is not predictive of disease recidivism. However, presence of extra- or intracranial complications does alter an otologic surgeon's preference of surgical approach. Also, the presence of extracranial complications could suggest more severe cholesteatoma as the presence of extracranial complications was associated with the presence of postoperative AE. This could justify an altered clinical FU, to anticipate possible occurrence of AE, for instance specifically after CWD surgery.

Mastoid Pneumatization and Ventilation, "E"

Previous classifications have included the development and extent of pneumatization and ventilation of mastoid cells, without it leading to a higher stage of cholesteatoma. The ChOLE classification does include mastoid pneumatization and ventilation in its staging system and our findings indeed suggest that the development of mastoid cells is predictive of cholesteatoma severity. A poorly pneumatized and poorly ventilated mastoid (i.e. diploic mastoid) was associated with a higher rate of recurrent cholesteatoma, regardless of surgery type. This suggests that suppressed mastoid cell development contributes to, or is a symptom of, the pathogenesis of the cholesteatoma. This is in line with previous reports showing mastoid air cell development to be suppressed more severely in chronic otitis media with acquired cholesteatoma than in chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma. Mastoid pneumatization ipsilateral to cholesteatoma has also been shown to be underdeveloped in comparison to healthy contralateral ears. Altogether this suggests that chronic inflammation or the presence of cholesteatoma matrix suppresses mastoid pneumatization, as previously suggested in the environmental pneumatization theory.

### Cholesterol granuloma mimicking CSF otorrhea by β-trace-protein production [^112GowJN]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study's motivation was the case of a 64-year-old patient who presented with a conductive hearing loss on the right ear due to chronic middle ear effusions. Following treatment with a ventilation tube, a persistent discharge was observed and interpreted as indicative of chronic mastoiditis. A mastoidectomy was performed; however, the discharge via the ventilation tube persisted. A BTP analysis of the discharge indicated a CSF leakage (6.10 mg/l, cut-off < 0.50 mg/l). Revision surgery was performed, with the intraoperative finding of a small region with exposed, inflamed dura. No leakage was found in this region, but the skull base was reconstructed. Nevertheless, the discharge and BTP detection continued. A second revision was performed, involving fluorescein staining of the CSF, disarticulation of the ossicular chain, complete inspection of the lateral skull base, and exposure of the oval and round windows. No evidence of CSF leakage was detected; however, as a precautionary measure, the round window was sealed with connective tissue. Effusion and BTP detection persisted. A thorough review of the case revealed the presence of cholesterol granuloma tissue in both surgeries.

The hypothesis that cholesterol granulomas might produce and secrete BTP was then tested by analyzing 10 other patients with the intraoperative clinical finding of a cholesterol granuloma. The aim was to determine whether cholesterol granuloma can produce otorrhea mimicking a CSF leak.
