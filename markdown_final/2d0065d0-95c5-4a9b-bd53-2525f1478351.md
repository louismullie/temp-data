## Question

amyloidosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about amyloidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and pathophysiology to anchor the framework. Then, I should classify the major subtypes and their mechanisms. Next, I will review organ involvement patterns and why cardiac disease drives prognosis. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic algorithm, including when noninvasive imaging can replace biopsy. Then, I will examine treatment strategies by subtype, including disease-modifying and supportive care. I should also consider special populations and emerging therapies. Finally, I will synthesize prognosis, monitoring, and key takeaways, while double-checking areas where older data might conflict with newer guidance and correcting them explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and pathophysiology. Amyloidosis comprises protein-misfolding diseases in which precursor proteins aggregate into insoluble beta-pleated sheet fibrils that deposit extracellularly, disrupt tissue architecture, and exert direct cytotoxicity, leading to progressive organ dysfunction; the pathognomonic histologic hallmark is apple-green birefringence with Congo red under polarized light, which I should verify as still the gold standard for tissue diagnosis [^115LNpwx] [^111WUgc5] [^117CUtMz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms of injury being uniform across types. I need to check the relative contributions of architectural disruption versus precursor toxicity. In AL, circulating light chains are directly cardiotoxic and nephrotoxic, whereas in ATTR, toxicity is more closely tied to fibril burden and tissue infiltration; this mechanistic difference helps explain why rapid reduction of precursor protein is especially critical in AL and why ATTR therapies focus on stabilizing or suppressing TTR production [^116AL2SY] [^112TwVMf] [^1122Hwzf].

> Next, I should review classification and the major subtypes. Systemic amyloidosis is categorized by the precursor protein, with more than 35 recognized amyloidogenic proteins. Clinically, AL (immunoglobulin light chain), ATTR (transthyretin, hereditary or wild-type), and AA (serum amyloid A, reactive) predominate, and I should confirm that AL and ATTR account for the vast majority of cardiac cases, which will matter for diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms [^115LNpwx] [^113vwXvm] [^116cDMMe].

> I will now examine AL amyloidosis more closely. AL arises from a clonal plasma cell or B-cell disorder that produces misfolded light chains. These precursors circulate and can deposit in virtually any organ, with cardiac involvement in roughly half of cases and renal involvement in up to 70%, and prognosis is tightly linked to the severity of cardiac disease, so I should double-check that early, deep hematologic responses translate into better survival and organ recovery [^117CUtMz] [^116YdDWa] [^114fDdY5].

> Let me consider ATTR amyloidosis next. ATTR results from misfolding of transthyretin, either wild-type (ATTRwt), which is strongly age-associated and a recognized cause of HFpEF in older adults, or variant (ATTRv), which is hereditary and enriched in certain populations such as individuals of African ancestry with the p.V142I allele. I should confirm that noninvasive bone-seeking radiotracer scintigraphy plus exclusion of a monoclonal protein now enables accurate diagnosis of ATTR-CM without biopsy in most cases [^1122Hwzf] [^111SogJ5] [^114JznBi].

> Wait, I should verify AA amyloidosis as well. AA is a reactive amyloidosis driven by chronic inflammation with elevated SAA, historically linked to infections and autoimmune diseases; modern control of inflammation has reduced its incidence in many settings, but I need to ensure I remember that AA can still cause significant renal disease and that suppressing the inflammatory driver is the cornerstone of therapy [^116cDMMe] [^116kYCHn].

> Next, I should review organ involvement patterns and why cardiac disease dominates prognosis. Cardiac infiltration produces a restrictive cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction, conduction disease, and arrhythmias; atrial involvement is common and contributes to atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism, while renal involvement manifests as proteinuria and progressive kidney failure; neurologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and soft-tissue manifestations also occur, and I should confirm that the pattern and burden of organ involvement guide staging and therapy selection [^1122Hwzf] [^114fDdY5] [^116YdDWa].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic algorithm is precise and practical. First, maintain a high index of suspicion in HFpEF, unexplained LV hypertrophy, carpal tunnel syndrome, or proteinuria. Second, screen for a plasma cell dyscrasia with serum free light chains and immunofixation. Third, use echocardiography with strain imaging and, when ATTR is suspected, perform technetium-labeled bone-seeking tracer scintigraphy with SPECT/CT and exclude monoclonal protein to enable noninvasive ATTR-CM diagnosis. Fourth, if imaging is equivocal or AL is suspected, obtain tissue with Congo red and, critically, perform accurate amyloid typing using immunohistochemistry and, when needed, mass spectrometry to avoid misclassification [^115LNpwx] [^112M987X] [^1179nEMB].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of mass spectrometry and why typing matters. Mass spectrometry–based proteomics has become the reference method for definitive typing when immunohistochemistry is inconclusive, and correct typing is essential because treatment is entirely precursor-specific; mislabeling AL as ATTR or vice versa leads to inappropriate therapy and harm, so I need to emphasize this step in centers with appropriate expertise [^116cDMMe] [^1179nEMB] [^112MZxsj].

> Let me think about AL treatment next. The therapeutic goal is rapid and deep reduction of amyloidogenic light chains using anti–plasma cell therapy, with autologous stem cell transplantation considered for eligible patients and modern regimens incorporating proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 antibodies. I should confirm that daratumumab-based combinations are now standard in many settings and that hematologic response correlates with organ recovery, especially when achieved early [^117SHvJd] [^112Zxfvd] [^111ffU5w].

> For ATTR, I should confirm the three mechanistic pillars. Tetramer stabilization with tafamidis slows progression in ATTR-CM and improves outcomes, while gene silencing with siRNA or antisense oligonucleotides reduces hepatic TTR synthesis and is effective for both neuropathy and cardiomyopathy phenotypes. Emerging fibril debulking strategies are under study, and I need to ensure that therapy selection considers phenotype, disease stage, and access [^1122Hwzf] [^111SogJ5] [^116979LL].

> But wait, what about supportive care across types. Heart failure management in cardiac amyloidosis requires careful attention to volume status, cautious use of vasodilators, and recognition that atrial fibrillation mandates anticoagulation given high thromboembolic risk; renal disease may require nephrology input and, in select cases, organ transplantation, and I should double-check that multidisciplinary care is repeatedly emphasized in contemporary guidance [^115LNpwx] [^116ueWNM] [^1122Hwzf].

> I should review special populations and modifiers of care. Older adults with ATTRwt often present with HFpEF and frailty, so early frailty assessment and rehabilitation can be integral to outcomes. Individuals of African ancestry have a higher prevalence of ATTRv due to p.V142I, warranting genetic counseling and cascade screening. And women with AL may have distinct toxicity profiles and require tailored dosing strategies, which I need to keep in mind when selecting regimens [^115PzpnP] [^114JznBi].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies and future directions. Antibody-based approaches to clear preformed amyloid, complement pathway modulation, and combination strategies that both suppress precursor production and debulk deposits are under active investigation. I should confirm that clinical trials remain essential to define optimal sequencing and to identify patients who benefit most from these novel mechanisms [^115ZUqz2] [^115KRQzV] [^113zBSDH].

> I will now examine prognosis and monitoring. In AL, median survival has improved substantially with modern therapy but remains dominated by cardiac involvement, with 5-year mortality around 65% in AL-CA versus 44% in ATTR-CA. Serial assessment should integrate biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin, dFLC), echocardiography with strain, and, in ATTR, periodic scintigraphy to track changes in tracer uptake that may reflect molecular remodeling even before structural regression, and I should verify that consensus statements recommend a multiparametric approach to monitoring [^111SogJ5] [^112UTmcb] [^114XjE2W].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled that alkylator-based therapy achieves responses in about two-thirds of patients, but I should double-check whether that figure reflects older eras and whether modern triplet or quadruplet regimens with proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 antibodies have pushed response rates higher. Indeed, contemporary data and guidelines support substantially improved hematologic response rates with current standards, so I should correct that earlier estimate and align with current practice patterns [^116QGxZq] [^117SHvJd] [^112Zxfvd].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic pathway to ensure no gaps. Noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM using bone-seeking tracer scintigraphy is robust when combined with exclusion of a monoclonal protein, but I should confirm that discordant cases or suspected AL still require tissue confirmation and proteomic typing to avoid misdiagnosis; maintaining a high index of suspicion in HFpEF, carpal tunnel syndrome, and proteinuria remains the linchpin for earlier detection and better outcomes [^115LNpwx] [^112M987X] [^1179nEMB].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit. Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous protein-misfolding disease in which accurate typing, early recognition of cardiac involvement, and precursor-targeted therapy drive outcomes. AL and ATTR require distinct, mechanism-based treatments, and multidisciplinary care with modern imaging and biomarkers enables timely diagnosis, precise monitoring, and improved survival, transforming what was once uniformly fatal into a treatable condition for many patients [^115LNpwx] [^1122Hwzf] [^111SogJ5].

Amyloidosis is a group of protein-misfolding diseases characterized by **extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils** [^115LNpwx] that disrupt organ structure and function, leading to progressive organ failure [^116rYNMi]. The most common systemic types are **AL (light chain)** and **ATTR (transthyretin)** [^113vwXvm], with cardiac and renal involvement driving prognosis [^116QGxZq]. Diagnosis requires **tissue biopsy with Congo red staining** [^1179nEMB] and **immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry** for typing [^112MZxsj]; in ATTR, bone-seeking radiotracers plus monoclonal protein exclusion enable noninvasive diagnosis [^112M987X] [^1122Hwzf]. Treatment is type-specific: AL uses anti–plasma cell therapy (including daratumumab) [^111ffU5w] [^117SHvJd], while ATTR uses TTR stabilizers (tafamidis) [^116979LL] or gene-silencing agents (patisiran, inotersen) [^notfound]. Early recognition and **multidisciplinary care** are critical to improve outcomes [^116CBJpx].

---

## Pathophysiology

Amyloidosis arises when precursor proteins misfold into **beta-pleated sheet fibrils** [^115LNpwx] that resist proteolysis and accumulate extracellularly, causing **mechanical disruption, oxidative stress, and apoptosis**, leading to organ dysfunction [^112TwVMf] [^114MaYCR].

---

## Classification

Amyloidosis is classified by the **precursor protein** [^112TwVMf]; over 35 proteins are recognized [^115KRQzV]. The most common systemic types are:

| **Type** | **Precursor protein** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| AL | Immunoglobulin light chains | - Multiorgan <br/> - Cardiac <br/> - Renal <br/> - Neurologic [^1153ydgJ] |
| ATTR | Transthyretin (wild-type or variant) | - Cardiomyopathy <br/> - Polyneuropathy [^116MD4x5] |
| AA | Serum amyloid A | - Renal <br/> - Hepatic <br/> - Splenic (secondary to chronic inflammation) [^116kYCHn] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical features are **organ-specific** and reflect the distribution and burden of amyloid deposition:

- **Cardiac**: Restrictive cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction disease [^114MaYCR].
- **Renal**: Proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure [^116CRQ13].
- **Neurologic**: Peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction [^116MD4x5].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Motility disorders, malabsorption, weight loss [^113yNqUV].
- **Hepatic**: Hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes [^116CRQ13].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach**:

- **Tissue biopsy**: Congo red staining with apple-green birefringence [^111WUgc5] is the gold standard [^1179nEMB].
- **Immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry**: Essential for accurate typing [^112MZxsj] [^116cDMMe].
- **Imaging**: Echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and bone-seeking radiotracers (99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP) are key for cardiac amyloidosis [^1122Hwzf] [^112M987X].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serum free light chains, immunofixation, and cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin) support diagnosis and staging [^116CRQ13] [^112Ab2w3] [^117PMWuY].

---

## Treatment

Therapy is **type-specific** and aims to reduce precursor production and stabilize or degrade amyloid:

- **AL amyloidosis**: Anti–plasma cell therapy (bortezomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab) [^111ffU5w] and autologous stem cell transplantation [^117SHvJd] [^112Zxfvd].
- **ATTR amyloidosis**: TTR stabilizers (tafamidis) [^116979LL] and gene-silencing agents (patisiran, inotersen) [^116MD4x5].
- **Supportive care**: Heart failure management, renal replacement therapy, and neuropathic pain control [^116ueWNM].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **type and organ involvement**. AL with cardiac involvement carries high mortality [^111SogJ5]; ATTR has a more indolent course [^116AL2SY] but remains fatal if untreated [^112M987X]. Early diagnosis and therapy improve survival and quality of life [^113vwXvm].

---

## Recent advances

- **Noninvasive diagnosis**: Bone-seeking radiotracers enable ATTR-CM diagnosis without biopsy [^112M987X] [^113qTtX5].
- **Novel therapies**: TTR stabilizers and gene-silencing agents improve outcomes in ATTR [^1153ydgJ] [^115ufKEk].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinated care improves patient outcomes [^notfound].

---

Amyloidosis is a **protein-misfolding disease** with diverse subtypes and organ involvement; **early, accurate diagnosis and type-specific therapy** are essential to improve outcomes [^113vwXvm].

Abstract

Wild‐type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is now recognized as a common cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In this review, we aim to describe the unique epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical features associated with ATTwt cardiac amyloidosis. Compared to other etiologies of HFpEF, ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis affects almost exclusively older adults, demonstrating a characteristic age‐dependent penetrance that impacts both the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. In addition, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis demonstrates a unique pathophysiology in contrast to other etiologies of HFpEF, which results in a characteristic phenotype that can raise suspicion for ATTRwt cardiac amyloid in the appropriate demographic. With these distinguishing features in mind, we aim to describe the specific signs, symptoms, and imaging characteristics associated with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis, including the role of nuclear scintigraphy that has essentially eliminated the need for biopsy in most patients with suspected disease. Finally, we review the evidence behind the available therapeutic agents, as well as those under investigation, which will change the way we manage older patients with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis in the coming years.

### Amyloidosis and considerations for the hand surgeon [^1131ZUfu]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis can lead to cardiac, renal, and other multiorgan failure. New treatments have become available that can prolong survival but rely on early diagnosis. Manifestations of amyloidosis in hand surgery include carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, peripheral neuropathy, and spontaneous distal biceps rupture. Often, these can predate systemic amyloidosis, offering hand surgeons an opportunity to diagnose patients with amyloidosis before systemic disease, refer them for treatment, and potentially alter disease course and prolong survival. In this review, we describe the pathophysiology and two most common subtypes of amyloidosis seen by hand surgeons. We provide guidance on biopsy practices and referral for patients with amyloidosis. Lastly, we provide a brief overview of the treatments for amyloidosis and their effect on disease course.

Future perspectives

The clinical variability of ATTRv amyloidosis presents a significant challenge to clinicians and researchers alike. Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this disease, as well as its pathophysiology are complex. As such, ongoing research efforts are focused on improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to clinical variability in ATTRv amyloidosis, as well as developing new prognostic and therapeutic approaches. Hopefully, growing knowledge of the intricacies of ATTRv amyloidosis will lead to a better understanding of pathogenesis and disease course, as well as earlier and more accurate diagnosis and treatment.

5.3 Future directions

ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis is a disease with an age‐dependent penetrance that exclusively affects older adults. ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis was historically difficult to diagnose and to treat, leading to universally poor quality of life and survival. However, for a prepared provider, there are numerous well‐defined clinical and imaging characteristics that can facilitate earlier diagnosis. At the same time, there are now effective treatments, and ideally more being tested in late phase clinical trials. Overall, the marked advancement in the diagnosis and treatment of ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis can be attributed to a better understanding of the precise pathophysiology of the disease and applying therapies targeted to these mechanisms. Experience in ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis can serve as a model to advance the study of HFpEF in general.

Amyloidosis is the name for protein-folding diseases characterized by extracellular deposition of a specific soluble precursor protein that aggregates in the form of insoluble fibrils. The classification of amyloidosis is based on the chemical characterization of the precursor protein. Deposition of amyloid is localized or systemic. The 4 main types of systemic amyloidosis are AL, AA, ATTR, and Aβ2M type. A schematic approach is proposed for the clinical management of systemic amyloidosis. The importance of typing amyloid with confidence, the usefulness of imaging techniques, the principles of treatment, and the need for well-planned treatment monitoring during follow-up are discussed.

### Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: a paradigm for advancing precision medicine [^115ufKEk]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Development of specific therapies addressing the underlying diseases' mechanisms constitutes the basis of precision medicine. Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) is an exemplar of precise therapeutic approach in the field of heart failure and cardiomyopathies. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, more precise data of its epidemiology, and advances in imaging techniques that allow non-invasive diagnosis have fostered the development of new and very effective specific therapies for ATTR-CM. Therapeutic advances have revolutionized the field, transforming a rare, devastating, and untreatable disease into a more common disease with several therapeutic alternatives available. Three main types of therapies (stabilizers, suppressors, and degraders) that act at different points of the amyloidogenic cascade have been developed or are currently under investigation. In this review, the key advances in pathophysiology and epidemiology that have occurred in the last decades along with the different therapeutic alternatives available or under development for ATTR-CM are described, illustrating the role of precision medicine applied to cardiovascular disorders. Pending questions that would need to be answered in upcoming years are also reviewed.

### EANM practice guideline for quantitative SPECT-CT [^112M987X]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis

Amyloidosis is a multisystem disease that is characterised by extracellular deposition of abnormally folded protein fibrils, resulting in progressive organ dysfunction, commonly affecting the heart. It includes three pathophysiologic amyloid types: primary light chain (AL) and transthyretin-related amyloidosis associated with (variant ATTR) or without a TTR gene mutation (wild-type ATTR). In case of a clinical suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis, based on clinical symptoms, specific demographics and serum biomarkers, scintigraphy with bone-seeking radiotracers such as 99m Tc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid [DPD], 99m Tc-pyrophosphate [PYP] or 99m Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate [HMDP] is highly sensitive and specific in the early identification of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis when a plasma cell dyscrasia is excluded. Also in asymptomatic TTR gene carriers at initial evaluation, in the screening for cardiac amyloidosis in case of new symptomatic heart failure, and in the follow-up of TTR gene carriers or patients with known ATTR amyloidosis and new or worsening cardiac symptoms, a cardiac phosphate scan is a key diagnostic technique. Using this procedure, it is possible to offer a non-invasive diagnosis, reducing the need for endomyocardial biopsy. Several visual and relative scoring systems have been used to quantify amyloid burden; however, there is a need for a more accurate measurement technique using quantitative SPECT-CT to diagnose and characterise cardiac amyloidosis at the earliest opportunity, to be able to accurately monitor response to therapy and to predict patient prognosis. This is very important, especially in the case of ATTR amyloidosis, which is a progressive and fatal cardiomyopathy for which several promising therapies are in development.

Context

Amyloidoses are disorders of diverse etiology in which deposits of abnormally folded proteins share distinctive staining properties and fibrillar ultrastructural appearance. Amyloidosis ultimately leads to destruction of tissues and progressive disease. With recent advances in the treatment of systemic amyloidoses the importance of an early diagnosis of amyloid, and a correct diagnosis of its type, has been realized.

Objective

To summarize current recommendations for the diagnosis of amyloidosis.

Data Sources

Presentation given at the 4th Annual Renal Pathology Society Satellite meeting in Istanbul based on discussions and recommendations formulated during an interactive diagnostic session held at the XIth International Symposium on Amyloidosis in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

Conclusions

Congo red stain is currently the gold standard for amyloid detection and the goal is to detect amyloid early. Diagnosis of the amyloid type must be based on the identification of amyloid protein within the deposits and not solely by reliance on clinical or DNA studies. However, the latter are recommended for confirmation of the amyloid type based on evaluation of the protein in deposits. Immunohistochemistry must be performed and interpreted with caution and inconclusive results must be evaluated further using the more sophisticated methods available in referral centers. An adequate amount and quality of tissue must be available for amyloid diagnosis and typing with emphasis on the use of fresh tissue and greater use of abdominal fat biopsy. The development of new technologies underscores the need for regular review of recommendations and standards for the clinical diagnosis of amyloidosis.

### Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis: clinical spectrum, molecular pathogenesis and disease-modifying treatments [^116979LL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a life-threatening, gain-of-toxic-function disease characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of transthyretin (TTR). TTR protein destabilised by TTR gene mutation is prone to dissociate from its native tetramer to monomer, and to then misfold and aggregate into amyloid fibrils, resulting in autosomal dominant hereditary amyloidosis, including familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy and familial leptomeningeal amyloidosis. Analogous misfolding of wild-type TTR results in senile systemic amyloidosis, now termed wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, characterised by acquired amyloid disease in the elderly. With the availability of genetic, biochemical and immunohistochemical diagnostic tests, patients with ATTR amyloidosis have been found in many nations; however, misdiagnosis is still common and considerable time is required before correct diagnosis in many cases. The current standard first-line treatment for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is liver transplantation, which allows suppression of the main source of variant TTR. However, large numbers of patients are not suitable transplant candidates. Recently, the clinical effects of TTR tetramer stabilisers, diflunisal and tafamidis, were demonstrated in randomised clinical trials, and tafamidis has been approved for treatment of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in European countries and in Japan. Moreover, antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs for suppression of variant and wild-type TTR synthesis are promising therapeutic approaches to ameliorate ATTR amyloidosis and are currently in phase III clinical trials. These newly developed therapies are expected to be effective for not only hereditary ATTR amyloidosis but also wild-type ATTR amyloidosis.

### Amyloidosis and bleeding: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^11261YS6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Amyloid diseases can be associated with potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. Pathogenetic factors contributing to the abnormal bleeding tendency in this setting are heterogeneous and depend on the type of amyloidosis and pattern of organ involvement. In patients with light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, acquired hemostatic abnormalities, including coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperfibrinolysis, and platelet dysfunction, can be regarded as the most important pathogenetic factors. In patients with other types of amyloidosis, acquired hemostatic defects are rare, and amyloid deposition has also been reported to be the main cause of abnormal bleeding manifestations. Amyloid angiopathy with increased fragility of blood vessels and impaired vasoconstriction may promote bleeding in this setting. Rupture of solid organs caused by amyloid deposition also was reported. Whereas therapeutic options in bleeding caused by local amyloid deposition are restricted to supportive measures and, in severe cases, surgery, acquired hemostatic defects may be treated according to the causative mechanism. In this review, we focus on bleeding risks in patients with amyloid diseases. Current concepts with regard to pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment are summarized and discussed.

### Novel approaches to diagnosis and management of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis [^116MD4x5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amyloidoses refer to a heterogeneous group of diseases that are pathologically characterised by aggregation of amyloid-fibril proteins deposited extracellularly, resulting in a toxic gain of function. In accordance with the official amyloid fibril protein nomenclature list published by the International Society of Amyloidosis, 36 amyloid fibril proteins are known to cause amyloidosis, with diseases classified according to the nature of the amyloid precursor protein. Transthyretin (TTR) is a human 56 kDa non-glycosylated amyloidogenic protein. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is caused by the deposition of variant TTR protein. The main ATTRv phenotypes include polyneuropathy (hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis–polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN)), hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis–cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM), and renal and ocular involvement. Hereditary transthyretin leptomeningeal amyloidosis (ATTRv-LA) is a rare neurological phenotype. ATTRv has been regarded as a rare endemic disorder; however, advances in diagnostic techniques have indicated that ATTRv is more frequent than previously recognised. Wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) manifests later and is increasingly recognised as the cause of amyloid cardiomyopathy, although it can also rarely cause peripheral neuropathy.

Advances in understanding of ATTRv pathogenesis has led to development of novel and therapeutic strategies. Aside from liver transplantation, alternative therapeutic options have including TTR tetramer stabilisers, genomic approaches using antisense oligonucleotide and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technologies, as well as novel TTR protein stabilisers and fibril removers. The following review examines the structure and function of TTR, potential pathophysiological mechanisms in ATTRv and the clinical phenotypes associated with ATTRv. Lastly, utility of therapeutic approaches targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms in ATTRv will be appraised.

### Modern treatment of amyloidosis: unresolved questions [^116ddYq7]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

During the past 10 to 15 years, there has been substantial progress in developing new treatments for the systemic amyloidoses. These advances have improved patient outcomes but have also raised new questions with direct clinical implications. For example, development of less intensive treatments for AL amyloidosis has made less certain the role of autologous stem cell transplantation, and new quantitative assays should now allow determination of the importance of fully eliminating amyloidogenic light chain production in AL disease. Additionally, observations from a clinical trial in AA amyloidosis have generated hypotheses about the relative contributions of amyloid precursors and mature fibrils to amyloidosis-associated kidney disease.

Management of Carriers of Pathogenic TTR Alleles

There is a critical unmet need to better understand the presymptomatic disease trajectory before the onset of clinical ATTR-CA. Unfortunately, there are no established imaging- or biomarker-based screening criteria to determine whether there is CA involvement in asymptomatic TTR mutation carriers. The proposed natural history of penetrance described here for carriers of pathogenic TTR alleles is shown in Figure 2. The p.V142I mutation is the most common cause of hereditary ATTR-CA worldwide. Estimates suggest that p.V142I ATTR-CA may constitute ∼23% of all ATTR-CA cases in the United States, and data from population-based cohort studies suggest that 3%-4% of individuals with African ancestry carry the p.V142I TTR variant. Therefore, given this variant's relatively high prevalence in the general population (∼1.5 million carriers in the United States), observations from p.V142I TTR carriers enrolled in epidemiologic cohorts have provided clues for subclinical ATTR-CA phenotypes.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: evolving diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1122Hwzf]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) results in a restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by extracellular deposition of transthyretin, normally involved in the transportation of the hormone thyroxine and retinol-binding protein, in the myocardium. Enthusiasm about ATTR-CM has grown as a result of 3 simultaneous areas of advancement: Imaging techniques allow accurate noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM without the need for confirmatory endomyocardial biopsies; observational studies indicate that the diagnosis of ATTR-CM may be underrecognized in a significant proportion of patients with heart failure; and on the basis of elucidation of the mechanisms of amyloid formation, therapies are now approved for treatment of ATTR-CM. Because therapy for ATTR-CM may be most effective when administered before significant cardiac dysfunction, early identification of affected individuals with readily available noninvasive tests is essential. This scientific statement is intended to guide clinical practice and to facilitate management conformity by covering current diagnostic and treatment strategies, as well as unmet needs and areas of active investigation in ATTR-CM.

DISEASE BACKGROUND: AL AMYLOIDOSIS AND ATTR AMYLOIDOSIS

Systemic amyloidoses are rare, multisystem, and phenotypically heterogeneous protein misfolding disorders characterized by deposition of amyloid fibrils in the heart and various organs, with amyloidosis type determined by the specific type of misfolded precursor protein.

AL amyloidosis is a monoclonal B-cell disorder associated with misfolded monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains affecting the cardiac, renal, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems and soft tissues to varying degrees in different patients. The multisystemic nature and nondescript presentation of AL amyloidosis often leads to delays in diagnosis. Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis typically requires biopsy proof of a plasma cell dyscrasia and amyloid formation. Prognosis has improved with available therapies but remains primarily dependent on the extent of cardiac involvement, which may be irreversible despite complete hematologic response.

ATTR amyloidosis exists in 2 forms determined by the sequence of the TTR gene: hereditary ATTR (ATTRv; also known as ATTRh, previously referred to as familial amyloidosis) or the wild-type form (ATTRwt, previously referred to as "senile" amyloidosis), which typically is a disease of aging. As with AL amyloidosis, cardiac amyloid deposition is usually the determinant of morbidity, and ultimately mortality, in these patients. ATTRv can exist as a cardiomyopathy (denoted ATTR-CM), neuropathy, or a mixed phenotype; available therapies have been shown to slow progression of neuropathy, – and in patients with ATTR-CM, there is currently one FDA-approved therapy that prolongs survival and reduces hospitalizations due to heart failure. However, even asymptomatic patients with ATTR-CM progress to heart failure and, if an appropriate candidate, may be considered for cardiac transplantation. Diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis is delineated based on screening for the presence of monoclonal protein, followed by biopsy of the clinically involved organ (if ≥ 1 abnormality) or bone scintigraphy and genetic testing as indicated.

Available therapies target precursor proteins for ALand ATTR amyloidosis;, the treatment landscape is evolving to also target amyloid deposition at the organ level (ie, anti-amyloid, amyloid-depleting, amyloid-clearing, or fibril-degrading treatments).

Despite advances in treatment, there is still an unmet medical need for assessment of organ-level treatment response for patients with AL amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis. Imaging biomarkers have the potential to detect organ amyloid deposition, capture changes in cardiac function over time in response to targeted amyloid treatments, and play an important role in patient selection and to guide therapy. Ultimately, disease staging from imaging could be used to develop dynamic adaptive therapy guidelines to inform clinical treatment decisions in systemic amyloidosis.

Systemic amyloidosis is a rare but increasingly recognised disease that is heterogeneous in presentation. Early diagnosis, whilst imperative, remains challenging but can improve prognosis and limit organ dysfunction. An increased repertoire of diagnostic imaging and histological techniques are becoming mainstream and promise to aid early diagnosis. Better risk stratification, via biomarkers and cytogenetics, has improved multidisciplinary treatment decisions. The use of novel agents has improved treatment efficacy, which translates into survival benefit. Newer strategies targeting pre-deposited amyloidogenic protein are under investigation.

Amyloidosis results from protein misfolding, and ongoing amyloid deposition can ultimately lead to organ failure and death. Historically, this is a group of diseases with limited treatment options and frequently poor prognosis. However, there are now 'targeted' therapeutics emerging in the form of stabilizers of the precursor protein, inhibitors of fibrillogenesis, fibril disruptors, and blockers of protein translation, transcription, and immunotherapy. We review many of these approaches that are currently being assessed in clinical trials.

Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most common form of systemic amyloidosis and is associated with an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. The disease often is difficult to recognize because of its broad range of manifestations and what often are vague symptoms. The clinical syndromes at presentation include nephrotic-range proteinuria with or without renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, congestive heart failure, and autonomic or sensory neuropathy. Recent diagnostic and prognostic advances include the serum free light-chain assay, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and serologic cardiac biomarkers. Treatment strategies that have evolved during the past decade are prolonging survival and preserving organ function in patients with this disease. This review outlines approaches to diagnosis, assessment of disease severity, and treatment of AL amyloidosis.

### Cardiac amyloidosis [^117G4yTe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a pathologic and clinical condition resulting from the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins in tissues. Extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils in the myocardium leads to cardiac amyloidosis, which is often overlooked as a cause of diastolic heart failure. Although cardiac amyloidosis was previously believed to have a poor prognosis, recent advances in diagnosis and treatment have emphasized the importance of early recognition and changed management of this condition. This article provides an overview of cardiac amyloidosis and summarizes current screening, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment options.

### The last decade in cardiac amyloidosis: advances in understanding pathophysiology, diagnosis and quantification, prognosis, treatment strategies, and monitoring Response [^111iu19m]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a clinical disease process characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils within the extracellular space of various organs. Amyloid fibrils are formed when proteins with an unstable tertiary structure misfold into insoluble beta-pleated sheets, resistant to proteolysis, that subsequently aggregate and deposit within the extracellular matrix. Disease occurs when the accumulation of amyloid fibrils disrupts the structure, integrity, and function of the affected organ.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) occurs when amyloid fibrils accumulate within the myocardium, causing interruption and distortion of myocardial contractile elements. The overwhelming majority of CA cases result from misfolded light-chain (light-chain amyloidosis [AL]) and transthyretin (transthyretin amyloidosis [ATTR]) proteins, although less common causes such as apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (AApoAI) and apolipoprotein AIV amyloidosis (AApoAIV) are increasingly being recognized. Despite differences in prevalence, clinical phenotype, prognosis, and treatment strategies across this heterogenous group of diseases, cardiac involvement is consistently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. –

Nevertheless, the majority of patients presenting with a characteristic amyloid CMR and either no uptake or mild cardiac uptake are subsequently diagnosed with AL-CA. Therefore, following the exclusion of rare TTR variants and rare forms of CA through comprehensive genotyping, the combination of a CMR that is characteristic for CA and grade 0 or 1 cardiac uptake on scintigraphy confers a 100% specificity for AL-CA and can be used to refine the diagnostic differentials while awaiting histologic confirmation.

Since the publication of the nonbiopsy pathway, use of bone scintigraphy to diagnose ATTR-CA has risen significantly, with multiple different technetium-based radiotracers being used. The diagnostic performance of these agents is assumed to be broadly similar; however, this hypothesis is yet to be tested in a head-to-head trial. It is possible that optimal image acquisition time and image interpretation techniques may vary between tracers. In the United States, 99m Tc-PYP is most commonly used and scans are predominantly interpreted by nuclear cardiologists; whereas in Europe, 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-HMDP are most commonly used and scans are predominantly interpreted by nuclear medicine physicians. Aside from the conventional visual score, quantitative scores derived from planar imaging have been used in the past. The heart-to-whole-body ratio is used for 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-HMDP, whereas the heart-to-contralateral ratio is used for 99m Tc-PYP; therefore, thoracic imaging may be acquired when using 99m Tc-PYP, whereas whole body imaging is acquired when using 99m Tc-DPD and 99m Tc-HMDP. However, these planar imaging–derived metrics are no longer recommended by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology for the diagnosis of ATTR-CA in isolation, and visual grading by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is mandated (SPECT–computed tomography [CT] if available may be preferred). SPECT images are able to differentiate blood pool activity (false positive on planar) from true LV myocardial uptake (true positive) (Figure 5). When the recommended imaging methodology is used, there is excellent interobserver reproducibility and intraobserver repeatability of 99m Tc-PYP visual scan interpretation. It is also hypothesized that the magnitude of myocardial radiotracer uptake, as quantified by these various methods, could reflect the CA burden. However, because of competitive tracer uptake, the dynamics and kinetics of radiotracer uptake are significantly influenced by uptake in the bones, soft tissues, skeletal muscle, and the heart. The presence of extracardiac amyloid would influence the percentage cardiac uptake; therefore, this may not be an accurate representation of the CA burden. In the era before availability of TTR-specific therapy, 99m Tc-PYP planar visual grade did not change after ~1.5 years despite clinical evidence of disease progression. In contrast, with use of TTR-directed therapies, emerging data show significant reduction in myocardial uptake of bone-avid tracers despite absence of significant changes in cardiac structure and cardiac function. This discordance with structural and functional imaging suggests that a decrease in bone-avid tracer myocardial uptake may represent a molecular change in amyloid fibril rather than a reduction in amyloid mass.

### Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in older Americans [^113qTtX5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt), formerly called senile cardiac amyloidosis (SCA), is almost exclusively a disorder of older adults. As the population ages, the diagnosis of ATTRwt will increase, making it the most common form of cardiac amyloidosis. An important precondition to reduce underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis is to maintain a high index of suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis. Several clues can be gleaned from the clinical history, physical exam, electrocardiography, and noninvasive imaging techniques. Nuclear scintigraphy agents using 99m Tc-phosphate derivatives combined with assessment for monoclonal proteins are eliminating the need for tissue confirmation in ATTR. Morbidity and mortality from ATTRwt cardiac amyloid is high and the emergence of numerous therapies based on a biologic understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition, including drugs to inhibit the synthesis of TTR, stabilize TTR, and degrade or extract amyloid, provides new hope for those afflicted. This review briefly covers the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations, as well as diagnostic strategies and treatment, of ATTR in older adults.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the suspicion and diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^113EHVaT]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathy is a manifestation of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), which is an underrecognized systemic disease whereby the transthyretin protein misfolds to form fibrils that deposit in various tissues and organs. ATTR amyloidosis is debilitating and associated with poor life expectancy, especially in those with cardiac dysfunction, but a variety of treatment options have recently become available. Considered a rare disease, ATTR amyloidosis may be more prevalent than thought, particularly in older persons. Diagnosis is often delayed because of a lack of disease awareness and the heterogeneity of symptoms at presentation. Given the recent availability of effective treatments, early recognition and diagnosis are especially critical because treatment is likely more effective earlier in the disease course. The Amyloidosis Research Consortium recently convened a group of experts in ATTR amyloidosis who, through an iterative process, agreed on best practices for suspicion, diagnosis, and characterization of disease. This review describes these consensus recommendations for ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy as a resource to aid cardiologists and others in the recognition and diagnosis of ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy. Included in this review is an overview of red flag signs and symptoms and a recommended diagnostic approach, including testing for monoclonal protein, scintigraphy, or biopsy and, if ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy is identified, TTR genotyping.

### Kidney amyloidosis: updates on pathogenesis and therapeutic frontiers [^115KRQzV]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Amyloidosis includes a diverse group of rare diseases characterized by the misfolding of native or mutant proteins, leading to extracellular accumulation in various organs. While 42 proteins have been identified to date, their distribution differs between systemic and localized forms.

Summary

Mass spectrometry analysis of tissue samples in the USA shows immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis as the most prevalent systemic type, followed by transthyretin (ATTR). Heart and kidney involvements are common. Although there are 14 recognized types of kidney-related amyloidosis, clinicopathologic studies in the USA have identified 11 types, with AL amyloidosis being the most prevalent cause of kidney involvement.

Key Messages

This review focuses on AL, AA, and ATTR amyloidosis due to their common systemic presentations. Recent US-based clinicopathologic studies challenge conventional beliefs that toxicity is primarily driven by amyloid deposition and highlight the role of the complement pathway. Diagnostic methods, particularly mass spectrometry, are crucial for accurate typing. Treatment strategies vary depending on the underlying type, with AL amyloidosis primarily targeting plasma cell clones, AA amyloidosis addressing underlying inflammation with systemic therapies, and ATTR amyloidosis focusing on ATTR stabilization or gene silencing.

The amyloidoses are a group of protein-folding disorders in which ≥ 1 organ is infiltrated by proteinaceous deposits known as amyloid. The deposits are derived from 1 of several amyloidogenic precursor proteins, and the prognosis of the disease is determined both by the organ(s) involved and the type of amyloid. Amyloid involvement of the heart (cardiac amyloidosis) carries the worst prognosis of any involved organ, and light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most serious form of the disease. The last decade has seen considerable progress in understanding the amyloidoses. In this review, current and novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis are discussed, with particular reference to AL amyloidosis in the heart.

### Amyloidosis-associated kidney disease [^111sbKZr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The amyloidoses are a group of disorders in which soluble proteins aggregate and deposit extracellularly in tissues as insoluble fibrils, causing progressive organ dysfunction. The kidney is one of the most frequent sites of amyloid deposition in AL, AA, and several of the hereditary amyloidoses. Amyloid fibril formation begins with the misfolding of an amyloidogenic precursor protein. The misfolded variants self-aggregate in a highly ordered manner, generating protofilaments that interact to form fibrils. The fibrils have a characteristic appearance by electron microscopy and generate birefringence under polarized light when stained with Congo red dye. Advances in elucidating the mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation, tissue deposition, and tissue injury have led to new and more aggressive treatment approaches for these disorders. This article reviews the pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of the amyloidoses, focusing heavily on the renal aspects of each of these areas.

1 INTRODUCTION

"Amyloidosis" refers to a group of diseases which are frequently underrecognized and misdiagnosed, resulting in inadequate management and inefficient resource utilization. These diseases differ in etiology, (and to a degree, presentation) but share a common gross and microscopic appearance. 1

Amyloidosis is the consequence of the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils (aggregates of insoluble low molecular‐weight protein subunits). The deposition of amyloid can occur at a variety of sites, the particulars of which are determined by the etiology of the amyloidosis. 2

Several types of amyloidosis have been described based on the specific protein comprising the deposited fibrils (Table 1). The most pertinent forms of the disease in the setting of cardiac amyloidosis are transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and immunoglobulin‐derived light chain amyloidosis (AL). It is uncommon for secondary (AA) amyloidosis to affect the heart and this is rarely seen in developed countries where severe chronic inflammatory processes are generally well managed. 3

TABLE 1
Type of amyloidosis characterized by precursor protein, cardiac and extracardiac manifestations

Cardiac amyloidosis most commonly occurs in the setting of systemic amyloidosis with multi‐organ involvement, although isolated cardiac amyloidosis has been described. Cardiac amyloidosis can progress quickly with rapid myocardial wall thickening and progression to congestive cardiac failure. 4

Despite the ongoing development of new treatment modalities, the prognosis of amyloidosis (especially with cardiac involvement) remains poor. This is particularly the case when the diagnosis is missed on first presentation and is only determined once the myocardium has suffered irreparable damage, as the patient is often too unwell to survive treatment. 4 Therefore an understanding of cardiac amyloidosis and a high index of suspicion is essential in the improvement of the prognosis of these patients.

### Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in black Americans [^112pDPNN]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis is a progressive infiltrative cardiomyopathy that mimics hypertensive and hypertrophic heart disease and often goes undiagnosed. In the United States, the hereditary form disproportionately afflicts black Americans, who when compared with whites with wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis, a phenotypically similar condition, present with more advanced disease despite having a noninvasive method for early identification (genetic testing). Although reasons for this are unclear, this begs to consider the inadequate access to care, societal factors, or a biological basis. In an effort to improve awareness and explore unique characteristics, we review the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and therapeutic strategies for transthyretin amyloidosis and highlight diagnostic pitfalls and clinical pearls for identifying patients with amyloid heart disease.

### AL amyloidosis: from molecular mechanisms to targeted therapies [^112Y1WAB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis is caused by misfolding and extracellular deposition of circulating proteins as amyloid fibrils, resulting in the dysfunction of vital organs. The most common systemic amyloidosis, light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, is caused by misfolded light chains produced by a small, dangerous B-cell clone. The process of amyloid formation, organ targeting, and damage is multifaceted and, after disease initiation, the complexity of the downstream pathogenic cascade increases, rendering its control a challenge. Because of the progressive nature of the disease, early diagnosis to prevent end-stage organ damage is vital. Improving awareness and systematic use of biomarkers of organ damage in screening populations at risk may improve the still unsatisfactory diagnostic process. Amyloid imaging is now emerging as an important companion of biomarkers in formulating the diagnosis and prognosis and monitoring the effects of therapy. An accurate diagnosis is the basis for appropriate therapy that is risk-adapted and response-tailored. Effective treatments targeting the clone and rapidly and profoundly reducing the amyloid light chains have produced marked improvements in overall survival, making AL amyloidosis the most successful model of all amyloidoses. New therapies targeting the amyloid deposits are now under development, together with novel agents modulating light chain aggregation and proteotoxicity. The future of AL amyloidosis treatment is combination therapy and will require an innovative collaborative model for a rapid translation from bench to bedside with the ultimate aim of achieving a cure for this complex disease.

### Myocardium from patients with ATTR amyloidosis produces less force secondary to increased fibrosis [^111fJcqB]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy wherein proteins are abnormally deposited in the myocardium. One of the common forms is amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis which can be age related or secondary to sequence variants in the TTR gene. Normally, the transthyretin protein circulates as a tetramer; however, in ATTR amyloidosis transthyretin dissociates into monomers which form fibrils. These fibrils deposit in the heart and lead to increased fibrosis, ventricular remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, and systolic dysfunction. Traditionally, cardiac amyloidosis has been thought of as a rare disease, but this view may be caused by underdiagnosis. Increased awareness of the disease and utilization of noninvasive technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) scans has shown it may be more common than thought, particularly in older patients.

Treatment of cardiac amyloidosis with traditional heart failure medications has limited efficacy. Pharmaceuticals that modify the pathogenesis of ATTR by stabilizing the TTR tetramer, decreasing synthesis of TTR, and increasing clearance of TTR fibrils in tissueshave shown potential for improving cardiovascular outcomes. As the prevalence of ATTR amyloidosis increases caused by increased screening and an aging population, improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with ATTR amyloidosis will require additional clinical and preclinical studies.

Research on cardiac amyloidosis has primarily focused on clinical or pharmacological studies. In contrast to hypertrophic, dilated, and ischemic cardiomyopathies, which have extensive literature on the molecular drivers of disease, investigation of cardiac amyloidosis at the molecular level has been minimal. To better describe the pathophysiology of cardiac amyloidosis at the molecular level, this study conducted biochemical and biophysical assays on myocardial samples from patients with ATTR amyloidosis. Because amyloidosis results in diastolic dysfunction and is thought to stiffen the myocardium, this study measured tissue-level stiffness and molecular regulators of myocardial stiffness such as titin, tubulin, and collagen.

Additionally, few studies have investigated whether cardiomyocytes and sarcomeres remodel with amyloidosis. To address this, the intracellular impacts of amyloidosis on the sarcomere were examined by measuring sarcomere mechanical properties and phosphorylation of sarcomere regulatory proteins. This provides a unique opportunity to integrate biochemical assays, histology, and muscle mechanics to examine how the myocardium of patients with ATTR amyloidosis is impacted at multiple scales.

### How I treat amyloidosis [^114bHV1c]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Amyloidosis is an uncommon disorder in which proteins change conformation, aggregate, and form fibrils that infiltrate tissues, leading to organ failure and death. The most frequent types are light-chain (AL) derived from monoclonal B-cell disorders producing amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chains, and the hereditary and "senile systemic" (ATTR) variants from mutant and wild-type transthyretin (TTR). Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy. AL is more frequent and causes more organ disease than ATTR. Although both can cause cardiomyopathy and heart failure, AL progresses more quickly, so survival depends on timely diagnosis. Typing is usually based on clinical and laboratory findings with monoclonal gammopathy evaluation and, if indicated, TTR gene testing. Direct tissue typing is required when one patient has 2 potential amyloid-forming proteins. In coming years, widespread use of definitive proteomics will improve typing. New therapies are in testing for ATTR, whereas those for AL have followed multiple myeloma, leading to improved survival. Challenges of diagnosing and caring for patients with amyloidosis include determination of type, counseling, and delivery of prompt therapy often while managing multisystem disease. Recent advances grew from clinical research and advocacy in many countries, and global husbandry of such efforts will reap future benefits for families and patients with amyloidosis.

### Cardiac amyloidosis – A review of current literature for the practicing physician [^111er1YW]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The amyloidoses are a family of diseases in which misfolded precursor proteins aggregate to form amyloid and deposit in body tissues. A very serious yet underrecognized form of this disease is cardiac amyloidosis, in which amyloid deposits into the extracellular space of the myocardium, resulting in thickening and stiffening of ventricular walls with resultant heart failure and conductive dysfunction. This review provides a discussion of the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of cardiac amyloidosis subtypes, as well as an up-to-date approach to diagnosis and treatment. Significant progress has been made in recent years regarding diagnosis and treatment of this condition, but prognosis remains heavily reliant on early detection of the disease. Two types of precursor protein are responsible for most cardiac amyloidosis cases: transthyretin amyloid, and immunoglobulin-derived light chain amyloid. An early diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis can allow for novel treatment modalities to be initiated with the potential to improve prognosis.

Amyloidosis is a group of complex diseases caused by the misfolding and aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils. Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is one of the most prevalent forms of amyloidosis, characterized by the gradual proliferation of light chains from plasma cell clones. A growing body of evidence has contributed to our understanding of its pathogenesis, presentation and clinical course. Increased recognition of its clinical sequelae has increased the prevalence of AL amyloidosis. Renal involvement, seen in up to 70% of cases, is particularly challenging due to its impact on quality of life and access to treatment options. Thus, early recognition of its unique sequelae, appropriate staging and a comprehensive understanding of treatment options balanced by their organ toxicities are crucial to managing this disease. We review the current treatment standards and discuss novel developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of AL amyloidosis for the Nephrologist.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114YXESx]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The amyloidoses are a group of systemic diseases characterized by organ deposition of misfolded protein fragments of diverse origins. The natural history of the disease, involvement of other organs, and treatment options vary significantly based on the protein of origin. In AL amyloidosis, amyloid protein is derived from immunoglobulin light chains, and most often involves the kidneys and the heart. ATTR amyloidosis is categorized as mutant or wild-type depending on the genetic sequence of the transthyretin (TTR) protein produced by the liver. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis mainly involves the heart, although the reported occurrence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis and biceps tendon rupture in these patients speaks to more generalized protein deposition. Mutant TTR is marked by cardiac and/or peripheral nervous system involvement. Cardiac involvement is associated with symptoms of heart failure, and dictates the clinical course of the disease. Cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed noninvasively by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or nuclear scintigraphy. Endomyocardial biopsy may be needed in the case of equivocal imaging findings or discordant data. Treatment is aimed at relieving congestive symptoms and targeting the underlying amyloidogenic process. This includes anti-plasma cell therapy in AL amyloidosis, and stabilization of the TTR tetramer or inhibition of TTR protein production in ATTR amyloidosis. Cardiac transplantation can be considered in highly selected patients in tandem with therapy aimed at suppressing the amyloidogenic process, and appears associated with durable long-term survival.

### Future developments in light chain amyloidosis management [^111ffU5w]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is challenging to diagnose, and it should be considered a cardiac emergency. There have been a great deal of advances in the treatment of AL amyloidosis from initial descriptions of melphalan therapy until the recent approval of the first AL amyloidosis specific drug (daratumumab). Comprehension of the pathophysiology and biology of AL amyloidosis is crucial to understanding the major therapeutic targets in which light chain stability remains as a major key target of therapy. Organ dysfunction is a result not only from disruption of organ architecture but also direct cellular toxicity. Novel antiplasma cell agents for AL like isatuximab (anti CD-38 monoclonal antibody), belantamab (anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody), and elotuzumab (anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody) are currently under investigation. Both diagnostic and therapeutic advances make the future of AL management bright while acknowledging the complexity of this patient population and focusing on a multidisciplinary approach.

### Pathophysiology and treatment of systemic amyloidosis [^116rYNMi]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Amyloid is an abnormal extracellular fibrillar protein deposit in the tissues. In humans, more than 25 different proteins can adopt a fibrillar conformation in vivo that results in the pathognomonic tinctorial property of amyloid (that is, green birefringence when an affected tissue specimen is stained with Congo red dye and viewed by microscopy under cross-polarized light). Amyloid deposition is associated with disturbance of organ function and causes a wide variety of clinical syndromes that are classified according to the respective fibril protein precursor. Systemic amyloidosis, in which amyloid deposits are widespread and typically accumulate gradually, continues to be fatal and is responsible for about one in 1,500 deaths per year in the UK. Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of systemic amyloidosis have resulted in the identification of new therapeutic targets, and several drugs with novel mechanisms of action are currently under development. Meanwhile, an increased awareness of amyloidosis coupled with enhancements to existing diagnostic techniques and therapeutic strategies have already resulted in better outcomes for patients with the disease.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to cardiac amyloidosis [^115mz8Za]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Often considered a rare disease, cardiac amyloidosis is increasingly recognized by practicing clinicians. The increased rate of diagnosis is in part due the aging of the population and increasing incidence and prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis with advancing age, as well as the advent of noninvasive methods using nuclear scintigraphy to diagnose transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis due to either variant or wild type transthyretin without a biopsy. Perhaps the most important driver of the increased awareness is the elucidation of the biologic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cardiac amyloidosis which have led to the development of several effective therapies with differing mechanisms of actions. In this review, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cardiac amyloidosis due to light chain (AL) or transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis are delineated as well as the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape that has emerged from a better pathophysiologic understanding of disease development.

### AL amyloidosis for the cardiologist and Oncologist: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^116AL2SY]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

Although a detailed discussion of the pathophysiology of the disease is beyond the scope of this review, the basic principles underlying the mechanisms of injury are critical for understanding the disease and treatment goals. Amyloidosis refers to a group of diseases in which there is extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of precursor proteins that self-assemble in a β-sheet conformation. The "L" in AL amyloidosis refers to the dominant protein that is depositing in AL amyloid fibrils, a clonal immunoglobulin light chain (most commonly secreted by a clonal plasma cell disorder). Because the clonal light chains circulate in the bloodstream, they can theoretically deposit as amyloid fibrils in almost any organ in the body; therefore, most patients have multiorgan deposition, although in each individual with the disease, the pattern of organ involvement varies. When amyloid fibrils infiltrate the heart, deposition is most commonly diffusely present throughout the myocardium, with amyloid deposits surrounding each cardiomyocyte (Figure 1).

When amyloid fibrils deposit, they can cause organ dysfunction by multiple mechanisms. Disruption of organ architecture routinely occurs; for example, with cardiac amyloidosis, increased wall thickness (due to amyloid fibril infiltration) directly leads to small end-diastolic volumes and can be a contributor to poor stroke volume/cardiac output. However, the primary mechanism of injury is likely to be from direct cellular toxicity from amyloid precursors; therefore, cardiac amyloidosis due to AL amyloidosis has been termed a "toxic-infiltrative cardiomyopathy". Organ injury and prognosis are dependent not only on cumulative amyloid fibril deposition but also on the type of fibril being deposited; this has been clearly demonstrated with worse prognosis in cardiac amyloidosis due to AL fibrils than ATTR fibrils, despite greater cumulative fibril deposition in most patients with ATTR amyloidosis. Therefore, preventing amyloid precursor/fibril deposition (e.g. by lowering circulating pathologic light chains in AL amyloidosis) may have a greater therapeutic impact than removing already-formed amyloid deposits. Perhaps not surprisingly, prognosis has been mainly dependent on earlier diagnosis and the successful reduction of circulating pathologic light chains after diagnosis, with limited success achieved so far with strategies of amyloid fibril removal.

### Cardiac amyloidosis – A review of current literature for the practicing physician [^1142kmaA]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The amyloidoses are a family of diseases in which misfolded precursor proteins aggregate to form amyloid and deposit in body tissues. A very serious yet underrecognized form of this disease is cardiac amyloidosis, in which amyloid deposits into the extracellular space of the myocardium, resulting in thickening and stiffening of ventricular walls with resultant heart failure and conductive dysfunction. This review provides a discussion of the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of cardiac amyloidosis subtypes, as well as an up‐to‐date approach to diagnosis and treatment. Significant progress has been made in recent years regarding diagnosis and treatment of this condition, but prognosis remains heavily reliant on early detection of the disease. Two types of precursor protein are responsible for most cardiac amyloidosis cases: transthyretin amyloid, and immunoglobulin‐derived light chain amyloid. An early diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis can allow for novel treatment modalities to be initiated with the potential to improve prognosis.

### The quintessential form of diastolic heart failure in older adults: wild type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^114M6PMT]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Among subjects with heart failure (HF), more than half have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). 1 The clinical syndrome of HFpEF encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse pathophysiology and thus far treatment strategies to impact survival and quality of life have demonstrated limited success to date. Recently, wild type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt) has emerged as an exception. Previously thought of as a rare disease, ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis is now recognized as an underdiagnosed cause of HFpEF that almost exclusively affects older adults, demonstrating a unique age‐dependent penetrance. As a result of the elucidation of the pathophysiology of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, there has been translational triumph marked by advancements in both diagnosis and treatment of ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis that will lead to meaningful changes in clinical outcomes including morbidity, mortality as well as functional capacity and quality of life, which is important to consider given the advanced age demographic that is affected. 2 In this review, we will highlight important and current concepts in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis in the older adult.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: diagnosis and treatment strategies [^117GTkc6]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis in the United States is most often due to myocardial infiltration by immunoglobulin protein, such as in AL amyloidosis, or by the protein transthyretin, such as in hereditary and senile amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis often portends a poor prognosis especially in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis. Despite better understanding of the pathophysiology of amyloid, many patients are still diagnosed late in the disease course. This review investigates the current understanding and new research on the diagnosis and treatment strategies in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Myocardial amyloid infiltration distribution occurs in a variety of patterns. Structural and functional changes on echocardiography can suggest presence of amyloid, but CMR and nuclear imaging provide important complementary information on amyloid burden and the amyloid subtype, respectively. While for AL amyloid, treatment success largely depends on early diagnosis, for ATTR amyloid, new investigational agents that reduce production of transthyretin protein may have significant impact on clinical outcomes. Advancements in the non-invasive diagnostic detection and improvements in early disease recognition will undoubtedly facilitate a larger proportion of patients to receive early therapy when it is most effective.

### Primary systemic amyloidosis with ischemic stroke as a presenting complication [^1149bGjh]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Amyloidosis is an uncommon disorder that ultimately leads to fatal multiorgan failure. Ischemic strokes have been sporadically described but are not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to review the pathophysiologic relationship between primary systemic amyloidosis and ischemic stroke, and to determine how often stroke is the first defining manifestation.

Methods

Retrospective study of 49 patients with confirmed primary amyloidosis and ischemic stroke. All included patients had biopsy proven amyloidosis.

Results

Forty patients were included in the study. Ischemic strokes occurred in 13 patients (32.5%) as the initial presentation of amyloidosis. Patients with initial stroke presentation had the worst outcome, with average survival of 6.9 months after established diagnosis with amyloidosis; strokes developed 9.6 months before diagnosis with primary amyloidosis. Thirty-seven percent experienced recurrent ischemic stroke. The majority (70%) of patients had cardioembolic infarctions.

Conclusions

Ischemic stroke is an underappreciated complication of primary amyloidosis. In the absence of obvious clinical and cardiogenic manifestations, primary amyloidosis should be considered when echocardiography demonstrates thickening of the valves, restrictive pattern, and increased echogenicity. Ischemic strokes as an initial presentation of primary amyloidosis carries a worse prognosis.

### Expert consensus on the monitoring of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^112UTmcb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a life-threatening condition with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. The recent availability of treatment for ATTR-CM has stimulated increased awareness of the disease and patient identification. Stratification of patients with ATTR-CM is critical for optimal management and treatment; however, monitoring disease progression is challenging and currently lacks best-practice guidance. In this report, experts with experience in treating amyloidosis and ATTR-CM developed consensus recommendations for monitoring the course of patients with ATTR-CM and proposed meaningful thresholds and frequency for specific parameters. A set of 11 measurable features across three separate domains were evaluated: (i) clinical and functional endpoints, (ii) biomarkers and laboratory markers, and (iii) imaging and electrocardiographic parameters. Experts recommended that one marker from each of the three domains provides the minimum requirements for assessing disease progression. Assessment of cardiac disease status should be part of a multiparametric evaluation in which progression, stability or improvement of other involved systems in transthyretin amyloidosis should also be considered. Additional data from placebo arms of clinical trials and future studies assessing ATTR-CM will help to elucidate, refine and define these and other measurements.

### Cardiac amyloidosis in older adults with a focus on frailty: JACC: advances expert consensus [^113eoMvn]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac amyloidosis is common in older adults, and often exists within the context of the known geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a dynamic syndrome that has many overlapping features with the end-organ systems affected by amyloidosis. Importantly, frailty is highly prevalent within the population of patients with amyloidosis, especially those that suffer from ATTM-CM (with or without HF symptoms). Amyloid is now recognized as a treatable condition, with disease modifying therapy available. Frailty itself is also reversible if identified and treated appropriately. Understanding the interplay between frailty, aging, and amyloidosis, therefore, can help our understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, as well as early implementation of frailty assessments and interventions.

### Atrial amyloidosis: mechanisms and clinical manifestations [^112o9Fok]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is now recognized as an important cause of heart failure. Increased wall thickness and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle are the most easily detectable manifestations of CA, but amyloid accumulates in all cardiac structures. Involvement of the left and right atria may be due to the haemodynamic effects of ventricular diastolic dysfunction, the effects of amyloid infiltration into the atrial wall, and the cardiotoxic damage of atrial cardiomyocytes by amyloid precursors. Atrial amyloidosis is an early manifestation of CA, and is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic events. Furthermore, atrial amyloidosis can be found even in the absence of systemic disease and ventricular involvement. This condition is named isolated atrial amyloidosis and is due to a local overproduction of atrial natriuretic peptide. In this review we summarize the evidence on the mechanisms and clinical relevance of atrial amyloidosis.

### Cardiac troponin in patients with light Chain and transthyretin cardiac Amyloidosis: state-of-the-art review [^117PMWuY]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an infiltrative disease caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the extracellular matrix, progressively leading to organ damage and dysfunction.CA now is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure, particularly with preserved ejection fraction. The 2 main types of amyloidosis that can involve the heart, amyloid light chain (AL) and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis, are pathophysiologically different. In AL amyloidosis, the amyloid precursor proteins are immunologic light chains (LCs) most commonly produced by a plasma cell clone. In ATTR amyloidosis, either variant (hereditary) ATTR (ATTRv) amyloidosis or wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis, the precursor protein is ATTR, which is produced predominantly by the liver and serves as a carrier for thyroxine and retinol. Although the disease management, course, and prognosis of AL and ATTR CA are different, at present, effective treatment options exist for both. The efficacy of these treatment options is dependent on disease stage at the time of diagnosis, determined mainly by the severity of cardiac involvement, which can be assessed using cardiac biomarkers and imaging techniques. Cardiac troponin (cTn) is the biomarker of choice for the detection of myocardial injury, and it is frequently found to be elevated in patients with CA, in particular when high-sensitivity assays are used. The extent of abnormalities in cTn is of crucial prognostic significance in these patients. In this review, we elucidate the significant aspects of cTn biology, measurement, and interpretation when it is used adjunctively to assist in the management of patients with CA. The multiplicity of possible causes for myocardial injury in these patients are addressed, with particular focus on the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms and common clinical scenarios.

### Cardiac amyloidosis in older adults with a focus on frailty: JACC: advances expert consensus [^115PzpnP]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis, a cause of heart failure (HF), is a systemic condition affecting a range of organs including the heart, peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal (GI) system, and kidneys. Amyloidosis occurs when misfolded proteins form amyloid fibrils that deposit in organs. Disease severity is correlated with the degree of fibril deposition, type and toxicity of the fibrils, and resultant organ dysfunction. There are 2 main types of amyloidosis that account for 95% of cardiac cases transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) or light chain amyloidosis (AL) due to plasma cell dyscrasia. Transthyretin is divided into hereditary (ATTRv), or wild type (ATTRwt). As ATTR and AL disproportionately affect older populations (age 75 or older) and are the leading cause of cardiac disease, these will form the focus of this review paper.

Amyloidosis is of heightened awareness within the medical community and is now understood to be more common than previously believed. This is largely due to noninvasive techniques that facilitate the diagnosis of amyloidosis in the appropriate clinical setting, and the development of several effective disease modifying therapies, with more in the pipeline. Historically, the treatment approach for amyloidosis was focused on managing symptoms and manifestations of the disease rather than addressing the production of amyloidogenic precursor protein. Therefore, many patients were diagnosed late, if at all. Amyloidosis is associated with progressive loss of organ and often physical function. As patients with amyloidosis are living longer, both AL and ATTR, it is time to focus on the long-term management of comorbidities, and frailty is a major consideration. Frailty is common and may serve as a target for intervention, especially as we now have therapies that address amyloid production. Overall, frailty is relevant since amyloidosis disproportionately affects older adults, since frailty is highly common in cardiac amyloidosis, and because of the potential bidirectional relationship between frailty and this HF syndrome.

### ATTR amyloidosis: current and emerging management strategies: state-of-the-art review [^115KToXC]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is increasingly diagnosed owing to the emergence of noninvasive imaging and improved awareness. Clinical penetrance of pathogenic alleles is not complete and therefore there is a large cohort of asymptomatic transthyretin variant carriers. Screening strategies, monitoring, and treatment of subclinical ATTR-CA requires further study. Perhaps the most important translational triumph has been the development of effective therapies that have emerged from a biological understanding of ATTR-CA pathophysiology. These include recently proven strategies of transthyretin protein stabilization and silencing of transthyretin production. Data on neurohormonal blockade in ATTR-CA are limited, with the primary focus of medical therapy on judicious fluid management. Atrial fibrillation is common and requires anticoagulation owing to the propensity for thrombus formation. Although conduction disease and ventricular arrhythmias frequently occur, little is known regarding optimal management. Finally, aortic stenosis and ATTR-CA frequently coexist, and transcatheter valve replacement is the preferred treatment approach.

### Current understanding of systemic amyloidosis and underlying disease mechanisms [^112TwVMf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a group of diverse disorders caused by misfolded proteins that aggregate into insoluble fibrils and ultimately cause organ damage. In medical practice, amyloidosis classification is based on the amyloid precursor protein type, of which amyloid immunoglobulin light chain, amyloid transthyretin, amyloid leukocyte chemotactic factor 2, and amyloid derived from serum amyloid A protein are the most common. Distinct mechanisms appear to be predominantly operational in the pathogenesis of particular types of amyloidosis, including increased protein precursor synthesis, somatic or germ line mutations, and inherent instability in the precursor protein in its wild form. An increased supply of misfolded proteins and/or a decreased capacity of the protein quality control systems can result in an imbalance that leads to increased circulation of misfolded proteins. Although the detection of mature fibrils is the basis for diagnosis of amyloidosis, a growing body of evidence has implicated the prefibrillar species as proteotoxic and key contributors to the development of the disease.

### Staging Alzheimer's disease risk by sequencing brain function and structure, cerebrospinal fluid, and cognition biomarkers [^115vRzey]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

An unresolved issue in evaluating AD biomarker utilities is how their changes influence the cognitive decline trajectory and clinical onset. Although earlier studies suggest amyloidosis impairment on cognitive function, this association remains weak and controversial. This study observed that cognitive impairment, indexed by MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and AVLT scores, occurred following abnormal brain network connectivity, CSF Aβ levels, and p-tau levels. It indicates that clinical AD symptoms emerge as downstream events following brain amyloidosis and neurodegenerative changes. Also, this event sequence provides evidence to support a recent concept that neither amyloidosis nor neurodegeneration is sufficient in isolation to cause the AD pathophysiological and clinical cascade; rather, the co-occurrence of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration significantly advances gray matter atrophy, accelerates cognitive deterioration, and increases MCI or dementia hazard in cognitively normal elderly cohorts. Mechanistically, emerging biological studies indicate that Aβ and tau interaction is a driving force in AD development. Aβ accumulation advances tau disease progression in that both enhance tauopathy and potentiate tau impairment on brain function. Further, tau is a required factor in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Clearly, current findings regarding the S optimal support the notion that, while amyloidosis and neurodegeneration arise independently, once both are present they interact to advance the AD pathophysiological cascade and are a key mechanism in transforming normal aging into AD.

### The molecular landscape of AL amyloidosis [^111EvoNy]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Amyloid light‐chain (AL) amyloidosis is a systemic clonal plasma cell disorder characterized by the production and deposition of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains (LCs), resulting in multiorgan dysfunction. Due to its intricate molecular mechanisms and diverse organ involvement, the disease poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This review explores the molecular landscape of AL amyloidosis, emphasizing genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic alterations. Key findings include chromosomal abnormalities, somatic mutations, aberrant gene expression, disrupted protein folding pathways and the role of cytokine and chemokine secretion. These factors collectively drive the overproduction and destabilization of amyloidogenic LCs, leading to organ‐specific amyloid deposition, clinical heterogeneity and variable patient outcomes. Despite therapeutic advancements, the disease's complexity challenges the development of effective biological models. Progressing towards personalized therapies requires the development of preclinical models and the identification of biomarkers and molecular data to design targeted interventions. This review highlights the importance of integrating DNA, RNA and protein‐level analyses to deepen the understanding of AL amyloidosis pathogenesis. Such insights are pivotal for improving diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutic strategies, ultimately advancing precision medicine for this challenging disease.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: where are we today? [^113GA2Vx]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis is generally considered to be rare, but the heart is frequently involved and is a major determinant of prognosis. New diagnostic imaging methods have recently been developed with the capacity to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis, which will be ever more important with the variety of new treatments on the near horizon. Most cases of cardiac amyloidosis are of either monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (AL) type, which can occur at any age from young adulthood onwards, or transthyretin (ATTR) type, which can be acquired in elderly individuals or inherited at a younger age. Cardiac involvement is the most serious manifestation of AL amyloidosis, and serum cardiac biomarkers have proved to be of great value in staging disease severity and response to an ever increasing array of chemotherapy agents. Cardiac involvement is the dominant manifestation of nonhereditary ATTR amyloidosis, also known as senile cardiac amyloidosis, the prevalence of which is not known but is probably much greater than currently recognized. A genetic variant in the gene for transthyretin (TTR), which is present in 3–4% of African Americans and probably a similar proportion of black individuals of African descent generally, appears to be associated with increased susceptibility to developing cardiac ATTR amyloidosis in older age. Several novel therapies are in the advanced stages of development for ATTR amyloidosis including TTR protein stabilizers and RNA inhibitors that greatly diminish TTR production. Here, we will review recent developments in the diagnosis and management of cardiac amyloidosis.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive multidisciplinary care for the patient With cardiac amyloidosis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113vwXvm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis — epidemiology and diagnostic advances: AL amyloidosis is estimated to have an annual incidence of 1 in 75,000 to 100,000 and a prevalence of 1 in 25,000, and approximately 75% of patients with AL have some degree of cardiac involvement. Observational studies indicate that ATTR-CM may be under-recognized in a significant proportion of patients with heart failure (HF). Imaging techniques and monoclonal light chain testing now allow for accurate noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CM in the proper clinical context without the need for confirmatory endomyocardial biopsies, and timely diagnosis will allow prompt implementation of therapeutic interventions that may improve survival, physical function, and/or quality of life.

### Evaluation and management strategies for GI involvement with amyloidosis [^113yNqUV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous disease that can cause a wide array of nonspecific symptoms when the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is involved, including weight loss, early satiety, change in bowel habits with diarrhea, constipation, or alternating bowel pattern. Endoscopy with biopsy for Congo red staining establishes the diagnosis and fibril subtyping helps to guide targeted treatment options. Light chain amyloidosis is the most frequent subtype found throughout the GI tract. Transthyretin amyloidosis is most likely to be found on rectal biopsy. Management of the symptoms of GI tract involvement with amyloidosis relate to addressing the underlying symptom complex that is produced and generally abstracted from the management of severe forms of functional GI disorders. Attention to improving symptom management and nutrition status can improve quality of life in these patients.

### Atrial amyloidosis: mechanisms and clinical manifestations [^116Vim7L]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of misfolded proteins as insoluble amyloid fibrils. Cardiac involvement is most commonly related to the deposition of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains (AL) or transthyretin (ATTR), either in its wild‐type (ATTRwt) or mutated form (variant, ATTRv). Greater disease awareness and the introduction of non‐invasive diagnostic algorithms have led to an apparent increase in the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis (CA), particularly ATTR‐CA. Early diagnosis allows the prompt initiation of disease‐modifying treatments, which are now available.

Increased wall thickness and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV) are the most easily detectable manifestations of CA, but amyloid accumulates in all cardiac structures. Left atrial (LA) involvement may be due to the haemodynamic effects of LV diastolic dysfunction, the effects of amyloid infiltration into the atrial wall, and the cardiotoxic damage of atrial cardiomyocytes by amyloid precursors (particularly light chains). The right atrium (RA) may be similarly affected. Atrial amyloidosis develops in early stages of AL‐ and ATTR‐CA, and is associated with an increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmias and thromboembolic events. Furthermore, atrial amyloidosis can be found even in the absence of systemic disease and LV involvement. This condition is named isolated atrial amyloidosis (IAA) and is due to a local overproduction of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).

In this review we summarize the evidence on the mechanisms and clinical relevance of AL‐ or ATTR‐related atrial amyloidosis and IAA.

CONCLUSION

While substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular landscape of AL amyloidosis, critical challenges remain in fully translating these discoveries into clinical practice. By addressing unmet needs in early‐stage pathogenesis and personalized treatment, and by developing research models, future research has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Close collaboration between the scientific community, industry and global health organizations is essential for driving these advancements forward.

### Electrophysiological manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis: state-of-the-art review [^112fvQv2]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Amyloid infiltration into the cardiac conduction system causes a plethora of electrophysiological dysfunction, most commonly atrial fibrillation. There is also increasing recognition of other important sequelae, including AV nodal disease and ventricular arrhythmias. The current evidence base for both electrophysiological interventions and the effect of new disease-modifying therapies on CA-related arrhythmias is sparse. However, in light of the ever-growing prominence of CA, these key clinical questions need to be clarified through high-quality collaborative prospective studies.

### The systemic amyloidoses: clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms offers hope for more effective therapies [^112hfpsS]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Knowledge about the systemic amyloidoses has increased considerably during the last few years. This group of diseases is characterized by great biochemical variability, including at least 11 different amyloid fibril proteins and a remarkable range of clinical manifestations. With the understanding that the pathogenesis is different in the various forms of amyloidosis, it is now being increasingly accepted that an early and accurate diagnosis, including that of the underlying biochemical nature, is crucial for a successful treatment. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in amyloidogenesis is at the basis of the recent blossoming of new, innovative and more effective therapeutic approaches.

### Pericardial disease in cardiac amyloidosis: a comprehensive review [^117BAs6y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, pericardial involvement is common, with up to half of patients presenting with pericardial effusions. The pathophysiological mechanisms of pericardial pathology in cardiac amyloidosis include chronic elevations in right-sided filling pressures, myocardial and pericardial inflammation due to cytotoxic effects of amyloid deposits, and renal involvement with subsequent uremia and hypoalbuminemia. The pericardial effusions are typically small; however, several cases of life-threatening cardiac tamponade with hemorrhagic effusions have been described as a presenting clinical scenario. Constrictive pericarditis can also occur due to amyloidosis and its identification presents a clinical challenge in patients with cardiac amyloidosis who concurrently manifest signs of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Multimodality imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, is useful in the evaluation and management of this patient population. The recognition of pericardial effusion is important in the risk stratification of patients with cardiac amyloidosis as its presence confers a poor prognosis. However, specific treatment aimed at the effusions themselves is seldom indicated. Cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis may necessitate pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy, respectively.

### Emerging therapeutics for the treatment of light chain and transthyretin amyloidosis [^115ZUqz2]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac amyloidosis is a restrictive cardiomyopathy with high morbidity and mortality, and is increasingly recognized as an underdiagnosed condition. Although no therapies have been approved for AL- or ATTR-CA, a number of therapeutics targeted at neoplastic plasma cells, transthyretin protein production, and amyloid fibril formation are currently in clinical trials. Additionally, mAbs aiming to remove existing amyloid deposits may improve outcomes for patients with more advanced cardiac disease. Future efforts should define the optimal treatment paradigms for cardiac response in AL-CA and ATTR-CA, and identify effective clinical, imaging, and serum biomarker strategies that reflect cardiac response to therapy.

### Amyloidosis: multisystem spectrum of disease with pathologic correlation [^113Vcr2e]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a group of conditions defined by extracellular deposition of insoluble proteins that can lead to multiorgan dysfunction and failure. The systemic form of the disease is often associated with a plasma cell dyscrasia but may also occur in the setting of chronic inflammation, long-term dialysis, malignancy, or multiple hereditary conditions. Localized forms of the disease most often involve the skin, tracheobronchial tree, and urinary tract and typically require tissue sampling for diagnosis, as they may mimic many conditions including malignancy at imaging alone. Advancements in MRI and nuclear medicine have provided greater specificity for the diagnosis of amyloidosis involving the central nervous system and heart, potentially obviating the need for biopsy of the affected organ in certain circumstances. Specifically, a combination of characteristic findings at noninvasive cardiac MRI and skeletal scintigraphy in patients without an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia is diagnostic for cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis. Histologically, the presence of amyloid is denoted by staining with Congo red and a characteristic apple green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. The imaging features of amyloid vary across each organ system but share some common patterns, such as soft-tissue infiltration and calcification, that may suggest the diagnosis in the appropriate clinical context. The availability of novel therapeutics that target amyloid protein fibrils such as transthyretin highlights the importance of early diagnosis.

The most common type, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL), is caused by clonal plasma cells that produce misfolded light chains. The purpose of this review is to provide up-to-date information on diagnosis and treatment options for AL amyloidosis. Early, accurate diagnosis is the key to effective therapy, and unequivocal identification of the amyloidogenic protein may require advanced technologies and expertise. Prognosis is dominated by the extent of cardiac involvement, and cardiac staging directs the choice of therapy. Treatment for AL amyloidosis is highly individualized, determined on the basis of age, organ dysfunction, and regimen toxicities, and should be guided by biomarkers of hematologic and cardiac response. Alkylator-based chemotherapy is effective in almost two thirds of patients. Novel agents are also active, and trials are ongoing to establish their optimal use. Treatment algorithms will continue to be refined through controlled trials. Advances in basic research have led to the identification of new drug targets and therapeutic approaches, which will be integrated with chemotherapy in the future.

### Longitudinal strain in the management of cardiac AL amyloidosis: do we need it? [^114XjE2W]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

This editorial relates to 'Longitudinal strain is an independent predictor of survival and response to therapy in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis', by O.C. Cohen et al.

Over the last years, research on light-chain (AL) amyloidosis has focused on the search for variables able to detect and quantify cardiac and renal involvement, predict survival, and monitor disease progression and response to treatment, in terms of the plasma cell disorder and organ damage. Finding reliable indicators of disease status becomes increasingly important given the growing number of therapeutic options.

Graphical Abstract
The place of longitudinal strain (LS) alterations in the natural history of amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The three concentric circles report, from outside to inside, the mechanisms of cardiac damage, the main pathophysiological abnormalities, and the corresponding echocardiographic findings. The order of the pathophysiological abnormalities and echocardiographic findings broadly reflect the timing of their development. LS, longitudinal strain; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MAPSE, mitral anular plane systolic excursion; MCF, myocardial contraction fraction; NPs, natriuretic peptides; RFP, restrictive filling pattern; SV, stroke volume.

In this issue of the European Heart Journal, Cohen et al. report the results of a detailed characterization of echocardiographic and haematology findings in 915 patients with AL amyloidosis [69% of whom had cardiac amyloidosis (CA)]. The authors report that longitudinal strain (LS) of the left ventricle provides important information about the whole natural history of AL amyloidosis. Indeed, LS values at baseline testify to the presence of cardiac involvement, which is an established predictor of outcome in patients with AL amyloidosis. Accordingly, LS also predicted survival independently of several variables from standard echocardiographic examination. Interestingly, patients with the most severe impairment in LS had a poor prognosis even regardless of the Mayo staging system (which includes biomarkers of cardiac damage) and other variables including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Changes in LS over time also reflect variations in cardiac function and, in treated patients, the response to therapy, with a possible added value over indicators reflecting the plasma cell disorder alone, such as the difference between involved and non-involved free light chains (dFLCs). Using this, the authors identify patients with an absolute improvement of LS ≥ 2% and a final dFLC < 10 mg/L after 12 months of treatment as the subgroup with the best prognosis.

Despite some methodological limitations acknowledged by the authors, the study is very stimulating and raises a number of questions.

Discussion — diagnostic evolution and implications in cardiac amyloidosis — As recently as 10 to 15 years ago cardiac amyloidosis was not routinely considered as a diagnosis to explain the etiology of heart failure (HF); the advent of an accurate, noninvasive imaging means to diagnose ATTR cardiac amyloidosis facilitated enhanced recognition of ATTR amyloidosis and its prevalence among patients with HFpEF and AS, and testing for ATTR amyloidosis has identified unrecognized cases of AL amyloidosis. Development of effective therapies to improve survival in patients with both AL and ATTR amyloidosis makes understanding diagnosis and management paramount, and the document emphasizes that the disease is more common than previously thought, has multisystem manifestations requiring appropriate referral to skilled subspecialists, and that although noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis appears potentially straightforward, diagnostic pitfalls may result in misdiagnosis with catastrophic consequences.

### Atrial involvement in cardiac amyloidosis: beyond dilatation [^114fDdY5]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is present in 50% of cases of systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) and is the major determinant of morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in AL amyloidosis is associated with a high burden of cardiac arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation (AF), which is typically poorly tolerated. In compliant ventricles, diastolic filling predominantly occurs in early diastole, whereas in CA, characterized by small noncompliant ventricles, there is increased dependence on the late diastolic filling mediated by atrial contraction. Therefore, the occurrence of AF in CA can have a major impact on patients' clinical stability, as the loss of synchronized atrial contraction will result in both a significant drop in stroke volume and increase in atrial pressure, which is commonly associated with new or worsening heart failure symptoms.

Although left atrial (LA) enlargement has been traditionally associated with AF, new-onset AF often occurs in its absence, suggesting a complex pathophysiology of AF in CA, in which multiple processes differentially compromise LA structure, function, and mechanics, increasing the risk of AF. Remarkably, LA remodeling in CA differs from the typical changes observed in heart failure or mitral regurgitation, where LA dilatation is the predominant characteristic. In CA, the typical phenotype of LA remodeling includes significant infiltration of the atrial walls with progressive loss of atrial function and increased stiffness, often in the absence of significant LA dilatation. These findings mirror the accepted pathophysiological model associated with ventricular amyloid infiltration, in which progressive extracellular amyloid infiltration increases myocardial stiffness, resulting in concentric remodeling and small noncompliant chambers.

### Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin protein: a review [^111SogJ5]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cardiac amyloidosis:

- **Definition**: Cardiac amyloidosis refers to infiltration of the heart muscle by amyloid proteins, resulting in cardiomyopathy.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by extracellular accumulation of misfolded protein fragments (immunoglobulin light-chain and transthyretin protein) in the heart muscle.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations are related to the development of restrictive cardiomyopathy and include angina, myocardial infarction, and HF. An increased risk of thromboembolic complications is also present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Unadjusted 5-year mortality rates are estimated at 65% in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis and 44% in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.

### Currents concepts on the immunopathology of amyloidosis [^116iEoP1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Amyloidosis is defined as the extracellular accumulation at systemic or organ-specific level of insoluble low molecular weight protein fibrils manifesting a beta pleated sheet configuration and a characteristic staining pattern. Several different types of proteins may lead to this phenomenon, and amyloidosis is defined by the biochemical nature of the protein in the deposits and further classified according to whether the deposits are localized or systemic, acquired or inherited, and by the resulting clinical phenotype. Amyloidosis includes subtypes such as light chain, associated with serum amyloid A protein, heritable and familial forms, dialysis-related disease, and organ-specific conditions. The pathogenesis and clinical features of these clinical and pathological entities will be critically discussed in this review article.

### Amyloid consults do not have to be vexing [^115DehTk]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing amyloidosis can be challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity, need for multiple specialists to make a diagnosis, and lack of a single diagnostic test for the disease. Patients are often diagnosed late, in advanced stage, and after exhibiting multiple symptoms and signs for a long period. It is important to develop a clinical suspicion of amyloidosis, particularly in those with multisystemic symptoms and high-risk patient populations such as those with precursor hematologic conditions. A systematic approach to the workup of suspected amyloidosis is key, including a comprehensive clinical assessment, laboratory tests to assess organ involvement, advanced imaging studies, screening for plasma cell disorder, and tissue biopsy when necessary. After making a diagnosis of amyloidosis, accurate typing of amyloid deposits, differentiating between localized and systemic amyloidosis, and appropriately staging the disease is important. Early diagnosis is crucial for improving patient outcomes and quality of life in light chain amyloidosis.

### Systemic amyloidosis from A (AA) to T (ATTR): a review [^116cDMMe]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis is a rare protein misfolding and deposition disorder leading to progressive organ failure. There are over 15 types of systemic amyloidosis, each caused by a different precursor protein which promotes amyloid formation and tissue deposition. Amyloidosis can be acquired or hereditary and can affect various organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, nerves, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, muscles, skin and soft tissues. Symptoms are usually insidious and nonspecific resulting in diagnostic delay. The field of amyloidosis has seen significant improvements over the past decade in diagnostic accuracy, prognosis prediction and management. The advent of mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics has revolutionized amyloid typing and has led to the discovery of new amyloid types. Accurate typing of the precursor protein is of paramount importance as the type dictates a specific management approach. In this article, we review each type of systemic amyloidosis to provide the practitioner with practical tools to improve diagnosis and management of these rare disorders.

### Updates in cardiac amyloidosis: a review [^111WUgc5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

Amyloidosis is caused by the extracellular deposition of autologous protein in an abnormal insoluble β-pleated sheet fibrillary conformation — that is, as amyloid fibrils. More than 30 proteins are known to be able to form amyloid fibrils in vivo, which cause disease by progressively damaging the structure and function of affected tissues. Amyloid deposits also contain minor nonfibrillary constituents, including serum amyloid P component (SAP), apolipoprotein E, connective tissue components (glycosaminoglycans, collagen), and basement membrane components (fibronectin, laminin).– Amyloid deposits can be massive, and cardiac or other tissues may become substantially replaced. Amyloid fibrils bind Congo red stain, yielding the pathognomonic apple-green birefringence under cross-polarized light microscopy that remains the gold standard for identifying amyloid deposits.

### Amyloid A amyloidosis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis: pathophysiology and treatments [^116kYCHn]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The introduction of biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory mediators revolutionised the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Targeting key components of the immune system allows efficient suppression of the pathological inflammatory cascade that leads to RA symptoms and subsequent joint destruction. Reactive amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, one of the most severe complications of RA, is a serious, potentially life-threatening disorder caused by deposition of AA amyloid fibrils in multiple organs. These AA amyloid fibrils derive from the circulatory acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A protein (SAA), and may be controlled by treatment. New biologics may permit AA amyloidosis secondary to RA to become a treatable, manageable disease. Rheumatologists, when diagnosing and treating patients with AA amyloidosis secondary to RA, must understand the pathophysiology and clinical factors related to development and progression of the disease, including genetic predisposition and biological versatility of SAA.

### Emerging therapeutics for the treatment of light chain and transthyretin amyloidosis [^113zBSDH]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a restrictive cardiomyopathy that results from the deposition of amyloid fibrils in cardiac tissue, causing progressive heart failure (HF) with median survival of 2 to 4 years. Two types of amyloid protein cause more than 95% of cardiac amyloidosis: immunoglobulin light chain, which causes light chain amyloidosis (AL), and transthyretin, which causes hereditary or wild-type (previously called senile systemic amyloidosis) transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR).

Although hereditary ATTRand ALare uncommon conditions, wild-type ATTR is likely underdiagnosed particularly among patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF) and calcific aortic stenosis. Despite growing clinical recognition of the disease, availability of reliable noninvasive diagnostic techniques, and significant associated morbidity and mortality, pharmacologic agents have yet to receive regulatory approval specifically for AL or ATTR with cardiac involvement.

This review highlights the new and emerging therapies for AL and ATTR with emphasis on their mechanistic effects on the amyloid disease-producing process and performance in early clinical trials. It is apparent that additional studies are needed to define the optimal treatment paradigms and to measure therapeutic cardiac response in light chain (AL-CA) and transthyretin (ATTR-CA) cardiac amyloidosis.

### The quintessential form of diastolic heart failure in older adults: wild type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^112qJwQF]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is now recognized as a common cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In this review, we aim to describe the unique epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical features associated with ATTwt cardiac amyloidosis. Compared to other etiologies of HFpEF, ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis affects almost exclusively older adults, demonstrating a characteristic age-dependent penetrance that impacts both the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. In addition, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis demonstrates a unique pathophysiology in contrast to other etiologies of HFpEF, which results in a characteristic phenotype that can raise suspicion for ATTRwt cardiac amyloid in the appropriate demographic. With these distinguishing features in mind, we aim to describe the specific signs, symptoms, and imaging characteristics associated with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis, including the role of nuclear scintigraphy that has essentially eliminated the need for biopsy in most patients with suspected disease. Finally, we review the evidence behind the available therapeutic agents, as well as those under investigation, which will change the way we manage older patients with ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis in the coming years.

### Systemic AA amyloidosis as a prion-like disorder [^112jWcfi]. Virus Research (2015). Low credibility.

Amyloidosis is a collective term for a group of disorders that induce functional impairment of organs and occurs through the accumulation of amyloid, or misfolded protein in beta-sheets. AA amyloidosis is a lethal systemic amyloidosis with SAA as the precursor protein, and is observed in various animal species, including humans. AA amyloidosis can be induced artificially by continuously administering inflammatory stimuli in experimental animal models. In this process of experimental induction, the administration of AA amyloids from either the same or different species is known to markedly expedite AA amyloidosis development, and this is also termed transmission of AA amyloidosis. Similarly to prion disease, AA amyloidosis is considered to be transmitted via a "seeding-nucleation" process. In this manuscript, we reviewed the pathology and transmissibility of AA amyloidosis in animals.

Key diagnostic strategies for cardiac amyloidosis — recommendations with strong level of consensus include that in patients suspected of having cardiac and systemic amyloidosis, identification of amyloid protein in specified tissues or affected organs is recommended to diagnose amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). If TTR amyloid is detected from a biopsy specimen, DNA mutational analysis should be used to differentiate between senile and hereditary amyloidosis (Level of Evidence C). When the diagnosis of amyloidosis has been established, imaging and further laboratory studies or biopsies should be considered to identify the organs involved (Level of Evidence C), and the extent of organ involvement is critical in determining treatment strategies and prognosis. Echocardiography should be performed in patients suspected of having cardiac amyloidosis or patients with systemic amyloidosis and HF (Level of Evidence B).

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize recent developments in the area of systemic amyloidoses with emphasis on pathologic diagnosis.

Recent Findings

In recent years, management of amyloidosis has shifted from a purely supportive approach to quite diverse, radical and aggressive treatments. The central issue is the understanding that treatment of systemic amyloidoses depends on the molecular type of the amyloid protein. In the United States and the Western world, AL-amyloidosis is the most prevalent type of systemic amyloidosis, but hereditary amyloidoses are being diagnosed with increasing frequency; genetics also plays a role in a subset of familial AA amyloidoses. The biggest challenge is in the diagnosis of AL-type with confidence and in differentiation of AL and hereditary amyloidoses. While careful clinico-pathologic correlation is recommended for all patients with amyloidosis, it is, in itself, not a substitute for amyloid typing.

Summary

The diagnosis of the amyloid type ultimately depends on the examination of the amyloid protein within the deposits. The role of immunohistochemistry - the current standard of care in amyloid typing - is evolving with emergence of alternative biochemical methods. Amyloid, being essentially a protein disorder, presents an attractive venue for the application of proteomics methodologies, despite their inherent complexities.
