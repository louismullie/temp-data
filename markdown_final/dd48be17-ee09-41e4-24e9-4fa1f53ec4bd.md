## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults (advanced + received prior chemotherapy)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating advanced soft tissue sarcoma in adults who have already received prior chemotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which agents are FDA-approved in this exact setting. Then, I should verify the labeled dosing for those agents. Next, I will review major guidelines to ensure alignment and identify alternatives. After that, I should consider histology-specific nuances and safety modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the indication and setting. The question is specifically about advanced soft tissue sarcoma in adults after prior chemotherapy, which immediately brings pazopanib to mind as the oral multikinase inhibitor with an FDA indication in this exact scenario, and trabectedin as a key cytotoxic option in later lines, particularly for liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, so I should verify both labels and guideline positions before concluding anything definitive [^114RiajG] [^114eJqs7].

> I will now examine pazopanib's labeled dose. Multiple FDA sources consistently state that pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily is the recommended dose for adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy, with treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and they also note that efficacy has not been demonstrated in adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which is an important exclusion I need to keep in mind [^114RiajG] [^111bGtYw] [^113XsoTx] [^117Fao4v].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for that dose. The pivotal trial supporting this indication was VEG110727, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in metastatic STS patients previously treated with chemotherapy, where pazopanib 800 mg daily improved progression-free survival versus placebo, confirming the dose and indication in this post-chemotherapy population, which reinforces the 800 mg once-daily regimen as standard in this setting [^114n6Qkg] [^113y1f2F].

> Next, I should review guideline alignment. NCCN lists pazopanib as a subsequent-line option for advanced STS and includes it among agents for patients ineligible for IV therapy or not candidates for anthracyclines, which supports its use after prior chemotherapy in appropriately selected patients, while ESMO guidance emphasizes offering agents like trabectedin in second and further lines, underscoring that pazopanib and trabectedin are reasonable options depending on histology and patient factors [^114eJqs7] [^112UCoBV].

> Hold on, I should verify histology-specific considerations because they change the hierarchy. For liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, trabectedin has stronger evidence and is category 1 in NCCN, whereas pazopanib is generally preferred for non-adipocytic, non-GIST histologies after prior chemotherapy; importantly, pazopanib's label excludes adipocytic sarcomas, so I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize pazopanib to liposarcoma where trabectedin is typically favored [^114bJydg] [^111bGtYw].

> I need to check safety modifiers and dose adjustments. Pazopanib carries a risk of severe hepatotoxicity, so baseline and periodic liver function tests are required, with dose reduction or interruption if liver enzymes rise, and clinicians should also monitor for hypertension, diarrhea, and other TKIs toxicities; similarly, trabectedin requires dexamethasone premedication and careful hepatic monitoring, so I should confirm organ function and comorbidities before committing to either agent [^112tmGqv] [^113F6yxd].

> Let me consider alternatives and sequencing so I don't jump to conclusions. After anthracycline failure, reasonable options include trabectedin for L-sarcomas, gemcitabine-based regimens such as gemcitabine plus docetaxel, and targeted or immunotherapy in selected subtypes, but the question is specifically about dosing in the post-chemotherapy setting where pazopanib 800 mg daily is the clearest, label-backed answer for many non-adipocytic histologies, while trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks over 24 hours is the standard for liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma in this context [^114eJqs7] [^114QCnAq] [^114RiajG].

> But wait, what if the patient is obese or has altered body surface area considerations. I should confirm dosing principles: pazopanib is a fixed oral dose and does not require BSA adjustment, whereas trabectedin is BSA-based at 1.5 mg/m2, and for cytotoxic chemotherapy, ASCO advises against routine fixed dosing except for select agents, so BSA-based dosing remains appropriate for trabectedin in this setting [^113evgvB] [^114QCnAq].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my final recommendation is precise. For adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of pazopanib is 800 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with the caveat that pazopanib is not indicated for adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma or GIST, and that histology-guided alternatives like trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks over 24 hours should be considered for liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma or when pazopanib is contraindicated or not tolerated [^114RiajG] [^111bGtYw] [^114QCnAq] [^114eJqs7].

---

The recommended dose for advanced soft tissue sarcoma in adults who have received prior chemotherapy is **pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily** [^114RiajG] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^111bGtYw]. This regimen is supported by FDA labeling [^117Fao4v] and NCCN guidelines [^114eJqs7] for patients with non-adipocytic, non-GIST sarcomas after prior systemic therapy [^114n6Qkg]. Monitor for hepatotoxicity, hypertension, and other adverse effects, and adjust the dose as needed [^112tmGqv].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard dose**: 800 mg orally once daily [^114RiajG].
- **Administration**: Take on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals [^notfound].
- **Duration**: Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^114RiajG].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dose

The recommended dose is supported by the **VEG110727 trial** [^113y1f2F], a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study in patients with metastatic STS who had received prior chemotherapy (excluding adipocytic sarcoma and GIST) [^114n6Qkg]. Pazopanib 800 mg daily significantly improved progression-free survival versus placebo (median 4.6 vs 1.6 months; HR 0.35; p < 0.0001) [^notfound], with a trend toward improved overall survival (median 12.5 vs 10.7 months; HR 0.87) [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and dose adjustments

Pazopanib is associated with significant adverse effects; **monitor and adjust therapy** as follows:

| **Adverse effect** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Hepatotoxicity | - Reduce to 400 mg daily if ALT/AST > 3× ULN <br/> - Discontinue if ALT/AST > 8× ULN or bilirubin > 3× ULN [^notfound] |
| Hypertension | - Reduce to 400 mg daily if uncontrolled <br/> - Discontinue if severe or persistent despite therapy [^notfound] |
| Other grade 3–4 toxicities | - Hold until resolution to ≤ grade 2 <br/> - Resume at 400 mg daily; if recurrence, discontinue [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative systemic therapy options

If pazopanib is unsuitable or ineffective, consider:

- **Trabectedin**: 1.5 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks for liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma after anthracycline failure [^114QCnAq] [^114bJydg].
- **Eribulin**: 1.4 mg/m² IV on days 1 and 8 every 21 days for liposarcoma after anthracycline failure [^notfound].
- **Gemcitabine-based regimens**: gemcitabine ± docetaxel or dacarbazine for anthracycline-pretreated patients [^1164Bt86] [^1172V8KW].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution; consider dose reduction [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers; adjust dose if unavoidable [^notfound].
- **Patient counseling**: Emphasize adherence, monitoring, and reporting symptoms promptly [^112tmGqv].

---

Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily is the **standard dose** for advanced soft tissue sarcoma after prior chemotherapy, with dosing individualized based on tolerance and adverse effects [^114RiajG].

Patients and methods

For this retrospective analysis, we have pooled all available data obtained in adult patients with STS treated in clinical trials with single-agent trabectedin at the approved dose and regimen: 1.5 mg m –2 given as a 24-h infusion q3w. We retrospectively analysed pooled data from 350 adult patients with STS treated in five phase II completed clinical trials. The efficacy and safety analysis of trabectedin in patients aged < 60 and > 60 years was performed by pooling individual data from 184 STS patients treated in three early non-randomised, single-arm, multicentre trials, 36 chemotherapy-naive STS patients and 130 patients with-sarcomas assigned to the 24-h q3w arm from the a pivotal, open-label, two-arm randomised trial (Figure 1). In addition, a subset of 24 patients aged ⩾70 years was also analysed. All studies were conducted in European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and local regulations on clinical trials, and were approved by the institutional review boards of each participating centre. Signed informed consents were obtained from all study participants before registration.

All patients were required to have unresectable advanced or metastatic, histologically proven STS. Patients with refractory STS were allowed to receive combined or sequential prior chemotherapies and must have documented progressive disease (PD) less than or within 6 months of last treatment. Other eligibility criteria included patients ⩾18 years old, a minimum life expectancy of ⩾3 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of ≤ 1, advanced disease with at least one unidimensionally or bidimensionally measurable lesion, adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function according to laboratory standard parameters, and recovery to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade ≤ 1 derived from any prior treatment-related toxicity. Exclusion criteria included brain or leptomeningeal involvement, prior exposure to chemotherapy or any experimental treatment concomitantly or 30 days before inclusion in the study, patients with a presence of other neoplastic diseases (with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin carcinoma or carcinoma in situ), or any other serious or unstable medical or psychiatric condition.

### Anlotinib as a maintenance treatment for advanced soft tissue sarcoma after first-line chemotherapy (ALTER-S006): a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^112sjnrM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) encompasses a group of rare tumours; STS accounts for fewer than 1% of adult malignancies but is associated with a high mortality rate. It has been reported that 14.5%–26.5% of STS patients present with metastases at the initial diagnosis, while 40%–50% of patients who underwent localized resection developed distant metastases and showed a 5-year survival of less than 10%. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is recommended as the standard first-line treatment for advanced STS; this approach yields a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only approximately 6 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 12–16 months. However, the benefits of continuous chemotherapy have not been proven to be greater than those of surveillance once the maximal benefit has been obtained, and there have been concerns with anthracycline-mediated toxicities, such as cumulative cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is necessary to explore appropriate strategies of postchemotherapy maintenance treatment to prolong the duration of response and delay disease progression in patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after a defined cycle of chemotherapy in advanced STS. Moreover, standard maintenance treatments for advanced or inoperable STS patients who benefit from first-line chemotherapy are still lacking.

### Clinical outcomes and safety with trabectedin therapy in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas following failure of prior chemotherapy: results of a worldwide expanded access program study [^1153VhV3]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This expanded access program (EAP) was designed to provide trabectedin access for patients with incurable soft tissue sarcoma (STS) following progression of disease with standard therapy. The outcomes of trial participants accrued over approximately 5 years are reported.

Patients and Methods

Adult patients with advanced STS of multiple histologies, including leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma (L-sarcomas), following relapse or disease progression following standard-of-care chemotherapy, were enrolled. Trabectedin treatment cycles (1.5 mg/m(2), intravenously over 24 h) were repeated q21 days. Objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated.

Results

Of 1895 patients enrolled, 807 (43%) had evaluable objective response data, with stable disease reported in 343 (43%) as best response. L-sarcoma patients exhibited longer, OS compared with other histologies [16.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 14.1–19.5) versus 8.4 months (95% CI 7.1–10.7)], and a slightly higher objective response rate [6.9% (95% CI 4.8–9.6) versus 4.0% (95% CI 2.1–6.8)]. The median treatment duration was 70 days representing a median of three treatment cycles; 30% of patients received ≥ 6 cycles. Safety and tolerability in this EAP were consistent with prior clinical trial data.

Conclusion

Results of this EAP are consistent with previous reports of trabectedin, demonstrating disease control despite a low incidence of objective responses in advanced STS patients after failure of standard chemotherapy. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT00210665.

### A phase II trial of panobinostat in patients with advanced pretreated soft tissue sarcoma. A study from the French sarcoma group [^117W5fPU]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients

This study enrolled adult patients (aged 18 years and older) who had a histological confirmation of advanced STS, excluding gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Patients with bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas and Ewing's sarcomas (both bone and extraskeletal), were excluded. Patients were required to be pretreated with an anthracycline-containing regimen for STS, to have received at least one line of therapy for advanced disease and to have documented disease progression according to RECIST within 6 months before study entry. Other inclusion criteria included ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2, adequate organ function (bone marrow, liver and renal function), normal serum levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium, and no significant heart disease. Patients pretreated with an HDAC inhibitor, patients receiving a non-substitutable treatment known to prolong the QT interval, and pregnant or breast-feeding women were excluded. Patients were to have stopped any previous systemic anticancer treatment at least five half lives before study entry. After amendment 4, the number of previous lines of therapy was limited to 3 prior cytotoxic regimens.

Study treatment

Panobinostat was administered orally on a thrice-a-week schedule (Monday, Wednesday and Friday (MWF)). The initial dose was 40 mg thrice a week. This dose was selected based on emerging data from phase I studies of panobinostat in patients with solid tumours or haematological malignancies that were near completion at the time of protocol writing. Dose reductions to 30 and 20 mg thrice a week were allowed. However, because of excessive toxicity in the first nine patients who received study treatment and based on the recommendation from an independent safety review committee, the study protocol was amended (amendment 4) to reduce the dose to 20 mg thrice a week. PK-PD data from phase I studies indicated sustained histone acetylation at doses of 20 mg MWF and higher. Following amendment 4, dose reductions to 20 mg twice a week and 20 mg thrice a week every other week were allowed. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity despite dose adjustments, and decision of the treating physician or patient withdrawal of consent.

### Interruption versus continuation of trabectedin in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma (T-DIS): a randomised phase 2 trial [^115AjMXt]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit or harm of trabectedin discontinuation in patients with non-progressive soft-tissue sarcoma remains unclear. We report the final analysis of a phase 2 trial investigating the clinical benefit of continuation of trabectedin treatment until progression versus interruption of therapy after six treatment cycles in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

Methods

For this open-label, non-comparative, multicentre, phase 2 study, eligible adult patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas, who had previously received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and were able to receive trabectedin, were enrolled from 14 centres of the French Sarcoma Group. Trabectedin was administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/m(2) through a central venous line as a 24-h continuous infusion every 3 weeks. After the initial six cycles of trabectedin, patients who were free from progressive disease were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to continuous treatment or therapy interruption. Randomisation was done centrally by a computer-generated system using permuted blocks of four patients, stratified by tumour grade and performance status. Patients allocated to the interruption group were allowed to restart trabectedin in case of progressive disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months after randomisation, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01303094.

Results

In 178 evaluable patients, 91 (51%) patients had not progressed after six cycles. Of these patients, 53 patients were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 27 to the continuation group and 26 to the interruption group. Overall, patients in the two groups received a similar median number of trabectedin cycles (continuation group: 11 cycles [range 6–31+] vs interruption group: 11 [range 6–23+]). After randomisation, progression-free survival at 6 months was 51.9% (95% CI 31.9–68.6) in the continuation group versus 23.1% (9.4–40.3) in the interruption group (p = 0.0200). The occurrence of treatment-related grade 3 adverse events (four [16%] of 25 patients in the continuation group vs three [14%] of 21 in the interruption group) and grade 4 adverse events (one [4%] vs none) was similar in both groups. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities were alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increases (one [4%] in the interruption group vs three [14%] in the continuation group), neutropenia (two [8%] vs two [10%]), and intestinal occlusion (one [4%] vs one [5%]).

Interpretation

We do not recommend trabectedin discontinuation in patients with advanced, doxorubicin-refractory soft-tissue sarcoma who have not progressed after six cycles of treatment.

### Trabectedin in the treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma: cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and value of information [^112aApuq]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

conclusions

TRA was a potentially cost-effective treatment of mSTS patients who have received priory A/I. In fact, the cost-effectiveness of TRA was comparable with or superior to many other cancer drugs for nonorphan conditions. The value of additional parameter information using equivalent setting and parameter definitions is likely to be low.

### Trabectedin is a feasible treatment for soft tissue sarcoma patients regardless of patient age: a retrospective pooled analysis of five phase II trials [^116zCrUd]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The primary end point in all trials was to determine the overall response rate (ORR) as per investigator's assessments or time-to-event end points, while safety was one secondary end point. Tumour response was assessed every two cycles according to the standard WHO criteria or the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and PFS and OS curves were estimated by using the Kaplan–Meier method. The disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and/or stable disease (SD) lasting ⩾6 months. Eligible patients were considered assessable for response if they had received a minimum of two cycles of treatment and had at least one disease assessment performed at least 4 weeks after entering the study. Safety analyses were based on all-treated population, defined as those patients who received at least one trabectedin dose. Treatment-related AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and graded according to the NCI-CTC.

### Anlotinib as a maintenance treatment for advanced soft tissue sarcoma after first-line chemotherapy (ALTER-S006): a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^116mnfCU]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Although one study demonstrated that maintenance treatment with a less intensive chemotherapy after standard chemotherapy could improve survival for patients with high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma, the benefit of maintenance treatment remains uncertain when used in advanced STS with non-specific pathological subtypes. The results of one of the largest international phase 3 trials to date showed that maintenance therapy with oral ridaforolimus in metastatic sarcoma patients (n = 711) after prior chemotherapy provided only a 3.1-week significant increase in median PFS. Currently, there is still no recommended standard maintenance treatment. Given the inherent toxicity associated with chemotherapy and the fact that agents used in maintenance therapy should be convenient and well tolerated, maintenance treatment with oral targeted drugs in advanced STS may be a preferred option and requires further exploration.

Anlotinib, a newly developed, orally multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), suppresses tumour growth and angiogenesis by mainly blocking the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathways. Exhibiting promising efficacy and manageable toxicity in various cancers, anlotinib was recommended as a third-line treatment for advanced NSCLC in 2018. Moreover, in 2019, based on the encouraging results of a phase 2 study (ALTER-0203) in patients with advanced STS, anlotinib was approved as the first second-line therapeutic agent by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for advanced STS. Although a retrospective study demonstrated that anlotinib may be an option for switch maintenance treatment after chemotherapy for advanced STS, whether anlotinib could be used as a maintenance treatment paradigm for patients with advanced STS after achieving disease control with first-line chemotherapy should be tested in a prospective study.

In this multicentre, open-label, single-arm, prospective phase 2 clinical trial, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as a switch maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy in advanced STS to demonstrate whether anlotinib maintenance treatment after chemotherapy could improve survival of patients with advanced STS.

### Trabectedin and olaparib in patients with advanced and non-resectable bone and soft-tissue sarcomas (TOMAS): an open-label, phase 1b study from the Italian sarcoma group [^117DHMiX]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Trabectedin is an alkylating drug with a unique mechanism of action causing single-strand and double-strand DNA breaks that activate DNA damage-response pathways. Based on our preclinical data, we hypothesised that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors might be an ideal partner of trabectedin and aimed to assess the safety, identify the recommended phase 2 dose, and explore preliminary signs of activity of trabectedin and olaparib combination treatment in patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcoma.

Methods

We did an open-label, multicentre, phase 1b study, recruiting patients from the national Italian sarcoma network aged 18 years and older with histologically confirmed bone and soft-tissue sarcoma progressing after standard treatments with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less. In a classic 3+3 design, patients received a 24 h infusion of trabectedin on day 1 and olaparib orally twice a day in 21-day cycles across six dose levels (trabectedin 0.675–1.3 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks; olaparib 100–300 mg twice a day from day 1 to 21). Intermediate dose levels were permitted to improve safety and tolerability. The primary endpoint was determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (the maximum tolerated dose). Safety and antitumour activity were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the results of the dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts. The trial is still active but closed to enrolment, and follow-up for patients who completed treatment is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02398058.

Findings

Between Nov 17, 2014, and Jan 30, 2017, of 54 patients assessed for eligibility, we enrolled 50 patients: 28 patients in the dose-escalation cohort and 22 patients in the dose-expansion cohort. Patients received a median of four cycles of treatment (IQR 2–6; range 1–17 [the patients who received the highest number of cycles are still on treatment]) with a median follow-up of 10 months (IQR 5–23). Considering all dose levels, the most common grade 3–4 adverse events were lymphopenia (32 [64%] of 50 patients), neutropenia (31 [62%]), thrombocytopenia (14 [28%]), anaemia (13 [26%]), hypophosphataemia (20 [40%]), and alanine aminotransferase concentration increase (9 [18%]). No treatment-related life-threatening adverse events or deaths occurred. One (2%) patient interrupted treatment without progression without reporting any specific toxicity. Observed dose-limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia for more than 7 days, and febrile neutropenia. We selected intermediate dose level 4b (trabectedin 1.1 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks plus olaparib 150 mg twice a day) as the recommended phase 2 dose. Seven (14%; 95% CI 6–27) of 50 patients achieved a partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1.

Interpretation

Trabectedin and olaparib in combination showed manageable toxicities at active dose levels for both drugs. Preliminary data on antitumour activity are encouraging. Two dedicated phase 2 studies are planned to assess activity of this combination in both ovarian cancer (EudraCT2018-000230-35) and soft-tissue sarcomas.

### Trabectedin is a feasible treatment for soft tissue sarcoma patients regardless of patient age: a retrospective pooled analysis of five phase II trials [^1166on7h]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Trabectedin (Yondelis), is a synthetic antineoplastic drug originally isolated from the Caribbean sea squirt Ecteinascidia turbinate. Trabectedin binds covalently to the minor groove of the DNA double helix, stalling the replication fork and leading to double-strand breaks that triggers a cascade of events that ultimately leads in G2-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition to direct growth inhibition, trabectedin at therapeutic concentrations has selective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties because of the inhibition of production of factors that promote tumour growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Recent data also suggested that trabectedin selectively targets macrophages and downregulates the production of proinflammatory mediators, which induces changes in the tumour microenvironment contributing to its antitumour activity.

The efficacy of trabectedin as salvage chemotherapy in adults with advanced, recurrent soft tissue sarcoma (STS) has been assessed in three non-randomised phase II trials and in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable advanced STS. A phase II randomised trial in advanced lipo- and leiomyosarcomas (-sarcomas) after failure of prior conventional chemotherapy found a superior disease control of trabectedin 1.5 mg m –2 given as a 24-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion every 3 weeks (q3w) compared with a weekly trabectedin regimen (0.58 mg m –2; 3-h i.v. infusion for 3 consecutive weeks in a 4-week cycle;). It is noteworthy that the benefits from trabectedin therapy in patients treated with trabectedin given as a 24-h infusion q3w were highlighted by progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 months (51.5%) and 6 months (35.5%), which largely surpassed the thresholds criteria established by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer to define drug activity in pre-treated STS (i.e. 39% at 3 months and 14% at 6 months;). Based on these results, in 2007 trabectedin obtained marketing authorisation from the European Commission and in many other countries worldwide for the treatment of patients with advanced STS after failure of anthracyclines and ifosfamide, or for those patients who are unsuitable to receive these agents (.

Soft tissue sarcoma — palliative radiation therapy notes that palliative radiation can improve symptoms from unresectable or metastatic disease. Radiation dose and fractionation should be determined based on normal tissue constraints, performance status, patient prognosis, and prior treatment history. Patients with limited volume metastatic disease and an excellent performance status may benefit from dose escalation through intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and patients who have previously received irradiation to the treatment site may benefit from IMRT or SBRT to improve the safety of reirradiation. These guidelines are intended to treat the adult population, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Using single-agent therapy in adult patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma can still be considered standard care [^116dTRcA]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

The group of soft tissue sarcomas in adult patients is a heterogeneous group with more than 40 different subtypes. While local treatment remains the mainstay for localized disease, systemic chemotherapy can importantly contribute in the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. For patients with metastatic disease, chemotherapy is a palliative treatment in the vast majority of the cases. In this setting, toxicity should not outweigh the potential benefits resulting from chemotherapy. In patients with locally advanced disease too extensive for local treatment, systemic chemotherapy can contribute to cure, provided that tumor shrinkage renders subsequent optimal local treatment possible. In these cases, chemotherapeutic regimens yielding the highest response rates achievable should be used. In the last decades, several randomized studies have aimed to determine whether combination regimens yield benefit over single-agent treatment in terms of response rate and overall survival. This review addresses the current available data on chemotherapy for adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma, excluding gastrointestinal stromal tumor, the Ewing-like sarcomas, and other small blue round cell tumors. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that future research in soft tissue sarcoma should focus on the identification of tumor factors that can serve as targets for treatment and that the diverse tumor subtypes should be analyzed separately for their sensitivity to systemic treatment. This review also focuses on these and other strategies that will hopefully lead to better out comes in this disease entity in the near future.

Desmoid tumors — systemic therapy outcomes and surveillance: In aggressive fibromatosis treated with imatinib, at a median follow-up of 34 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 55% and 95%, respectively, and the non-progression rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 91%, 80%, and 67%, respectively. In a study of 26 patients, sorafenib induced partial response (PR) in 25% and 70% had stable disease, with a median follow-up of 6 months; 11 received sorafenib as first-line therapy and the remaining 15 had received a median of 2 prior systemic therapies. The guidelines have included NSAIDs (sulindac or celecoxib), hormonal or biological agents (tamoxifen, toremifene, or low-dose interferon), chemotherapy (methotrexate and vinblastine, doxorubicin-based regimens), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; imatinib and sorafenib) as options for systemic therapy for advanced or unresectable desmoid tumors, and the risk of cardiovascular events may be increased in patients receiving celecoxib; physicians prescribing celecoxib should consider this information when weighing the benefits against risks for individual patients. Surveillance is specified as: every patient should have an H&P with CT or MRI every 3 to 6 months for 2 to 3 years and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and disease progression or recurrence should be managed as described under primary treatment.

### A randomized phase III trial comparing trabectedin to best supportive care in patients with pre-treated soft tissue sarcoma: T-SAR, a French sarcoma group trial [^114tBFNo]. Annals of Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The French Sarcoma Group assessed the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) of trabectedin versus best supportive care (BSC) in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

Patients and Methods

This randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase III study included adults with STS who progressed after 1–3 prior treatment lines. Patients were randomized (1: 1) to receive trabectedin 1.5 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks or BSC, stratified into L-STS (liposarcoma/leiomyosarcoma) and non-L-STS groups (other histotypes). Patients from the BSC arm were allowed to cross over to trabectedin at progression. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) confirmed by blinded central review and analyzed in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Between 26 January 2015 and 5 November 2015, 103 heavily pre-treated patients (60.2% with L-STS) from 16 French centers were allocated to receive trabectedin (n = 52) or BSC (n = 51). Median PFS was 3.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8–5.9 months] in the trabectedin arm versus 1.5 months (0.9–2.6 months) in the BSC arm (hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% CI 0.24–0.64, P < 0.001) with benefits observed across almost all analyzed subgroups, but particularly in patients with L-STS (5.1 versus 1.4 months, P = 0.0001). Seven patients (13.7%) in the trabectedin arm (all with L-STS) achieved a partial response, while no objective responses were observed in the BSC arm (P = 0.004). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (44.2% of patients), leukopenia (34.6%), and transaminase increase (32.7%). Health-related 30-item core European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire evidenced no statistical differences between the arms for any domain and at any time point. After progression, 91.8% of patients crossed over from BSC to trabectedin.

Conclusion

Trabectedin demonstrates superior disease control to BSC without impairing QoL in patients with recurrent STS of multiple histologies, with greater impact in patients with L-STS.

### Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the palliative treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma [^111LHc7m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable controversy exists as to whether any benefit of doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy outweighs increased toxic effects, inconvenience, and additional costs, compared to single-agent doxorubicin. There is substantial variation in clinical practice in the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

Objectives

To determine:1) the effect, if any on response rate or survival, by using doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy compared with single-agent doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic STS2)if combination chemotherapy is associated with increased adverse effects compared with single-agent doxorubicin in this setting.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2002), CANCER LIT (1975 to October 2002), reference lists, the Physician Data Query (PDQ) clinical trials database, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting Proceedings (1995 to 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing single-agent doxorubicin with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy in adults with locally advanced or metastatic STS requiring palliative chemotherapy. Abstracts and full reports published in English were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted and assessed by two reviewers. Response and survival data were pooled. Data on adverse effects was tabulated.

Main Results

Data on 2281 participants from eight RCTs were available from reports of single-agent doxorubicin versus doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy. Meta-analysis using the fixed effect model detected a higher tumour response rate with combination chemotherapy compared with single-agent chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.60; p = 0.03), but the OR from a pooled analysis using the random effects model and the same data did not achieve statistical significance (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.67; p = 0.10). No significant difference between the two regimens was detected in the pooled one-year mortality rate (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.05; p = 0.14) or two-year mortality rate (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.06; p = 0.13) (N = 2097). Although reporting of adverse effects was limited and inconsistent among trials (making pooling of data for this outcome impossible), adverse effects such as nausea/vomiting and hematologic toxic effects were consistently reported as being worse with combination chemotherapy across the eight eligible studies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Compared to single-agent doxorubicin, the combination chemotherapy regimens evaluated, given in conventional doses, produced only marginal increases in response rates, at the expense of increased toxic effects and with no improvements in overall survival.

- PORT has been tested in a single-institution randomized trial of 141 patients with extremity sarcomas who were treated with limb-sparing surgery. Patients with high-grade tumors also received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either radiation therapy concurrently with chemotherapy or no radiation.
- An absolute benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy of 6% for local relapse-free interval, 10% for distant relapse-free interval, and 10% for RFS.
- In a third, underpowered, single-center trial, 88 patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas underwent surgery and were then randomly assigned to receive four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy, epirubicin or epirubicin plus ifosfamide, versus no adjuvant chemotherapy. The trial was closed prematurely because of a slow accrual rate. P = 0. 06).
- All the benefit associated with chemotherapy appeared restricted to the 19 patients who received epirubicin plus ifosfamide.
- After a median follow-up of 94 months, the 5-year DFS rates were 69% in the chemotherapy arm and 44% in the control arm plus ifosfamide. The remaining 13 trials used doxorubicin alone or with other drugs.

### Gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line treatment in previously untreated advanced unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas (GeDDiS): a randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^116NJuu4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the results of the current study are consistent with two other first-line studies in locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma that included doxorubicin as the control group, with the median progression-free survival of 23.3 weeks in the doxorubicin group in the current study similar to the 22.5 weeksand 26 weeksreported in the other studies. This is also true of median overall survival, which was 76.3 weeks in the doxorubicin group in the current study, compared with 73.2 weeksand 82.3 weekswith doxorubicin in the other studies. Interestingly, all three studies showed an improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with the preceding published trial of Judson and colleagues(progression-free survival of 19.9 weeks and overall survival of 55.4 weeks), which had recruited patients several years earlier, suggesting that outcomes have improved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma in recent years. The explanation for this is likely to be multifactorial. Clinicians might be better at selecting patients most likely to benefit from palliative chemotherapy for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, and are treating patients more aggressively in terms of minimising dose reductions and treatment delays, with greater use of supportive medications such as growth factors. A further factor might be increasing use of local therapies such as radiotherapy and surgery for patients with metastatic disease, which has been associated with longer overall survival than for patients not receiving such therapies. Indeed, 57 patients on the GeDDiS trial went on to receive surgery or radiotherapy after completing study treatment.

Soft tissue sarcomas comprise multiple histologic subtypes, occur at a number of anatomic sites, and require individualized treatment. Over the past 5 years, 4 new drugs were approved for sarcoma, most of which are driven by histology or the anticipated response to treatment. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for resectable tumors. For unresectable or metastatic disease, doxorubicin remains the backbone of chemotherapy, but other agents have improved on its single-agent efficacy. Chief among them is olaratumab, which, in combination with doxorubicin, is preferred over doxorubicin alone in the updated NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

While cytotoxic chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), clinical outcomes remain suboptimal. Our prior study showed lurbinectedin plus doxorubicin is well tolerated with promising clinical activity in STS. We designed this phase 1b trial to optimize dosing as the basis for a randomized trial in leiomyosarcoma and to further explore the safety profile and efficacy signal.

Patients and Methods

Patients had advanced/metastatic STS and no prior anthracycline/lurbinectedin/trabectedin. Escalation followed a 3 + 3 design with 3-week cycles: lurbinectedin (3.2 mg/m2 day 1) and two doxorubicin levels (DL1, 25 mg/m2 day 1; DL2, 25 mg/m2 days 1 and 8). The primary objectives were to identify the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for subsequent randomized trials.

Results

Ten patients were enrolled in a 6-month period. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were grade (G) 2 fatigue and nausea, and G2 cytopenias with no febrile neutropenia events. There were two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at DL2 [day 8 (G2 alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase increase, G3 neutropenia)], and one DLT in DL1 (G3 ALT increase). These were reversible and all patients continued the study. DL1 was chosen for further study. At the time of data cutoff, the estimated median progression-free survival is 16.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.0-ND]. The objective response rate was 60% (6/10 confirmed partial responses).

Conclusions

In this phase 1b study, the recommended dose is lurbinectedin 3.2 mg/m2 in combination with doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The study combination was well tolerated and demonstrated intriguing clinical activity.

14.2 Soft Tissue Sarcoma

The efficacy of pazopanib tablets was evaluated in VEG110727, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (NCT00753688). Patients with metastatic STS who had received prior chemotherapy, including anthracycline treatment, or were unsuited for such therapy, were randomized (2:1) to receive pazopanib tablets 800 mg once daily or placebo. Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) or adipocytic sarcoma were excluded from the trial. Randomization was stratified by the factors of WHO performance status (WHO PS) 0 or 1 at baseline and the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 versus 2+). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS assessed by independent radiological review. Additional outcome measures were OS, ORR, and duration of response.

The majority of patients were female (59%) with a median age of 55 years. Seventy-two percent of patients were white, 22% were Asian, and 6% were other. Forty-three percent of patients had leiomyosarcoma, 10% had synovial sarcoma, and 47% had other soft tissue sarcomas. Fifty-six percent of patients had received 2 or more lines of prior systemic therapy and 44% had received 0 or 1 lines of prior systemic therapy.

Efficacy results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 2.

### Assessment of safety and efficacy of combined trabectedin and low-dose radiotherapy for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas: a nonrandomized phase 1 / 2 clinical trial [^117MjcPt]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Active therapeutic combinations, such as trabectedin and radiotherapy, offer potentially higher dimensional response in second-line treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcomas. Dimensional response can be relevant both for symptom relief and for survival.

Objective

To assess the combined use of trabectedin and radiotherapy in treating patients with progressing metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 1 of this nonrandomized clinical trial followed the classic 3+3 design, with planned radiotherapy at a fixed dose of 30 Gy (3 Gy/d for 10 days) and infusion of trabectedin at 1.3 mg/m2 as the starting dose, 1.5 mg/m2 as dose level +1, and 1.1 mg/m2 as dose level -1. Phase 2 followed the Simon optimal 2-stage design. Allowing for type I and II errors of 10%, treatment success was defined as an overall response rate of 35%. This study was conducted in 9 sarcoma referral centers in Spain, France, and Italy from April 13, 2015, to November 20, 2018. Adult patients with progressing metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and having undergone at least 1 previous line of systemic therapy were enrolled. In phase 2, patients fitting inclusion criteria and receiving at least 1 cycle of trabectedin and the radiotherapy regimen constituted the per-protocol population; those receiving at least 1 cycle of trabectedin, the safety population.

Interventions

Trabectedin was administered every 3 weeks in a 24-hour infusion. Radiotherapy was required to start within 1 hour after completion of the first trabectedin infusion (cycle 1, day 2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The dose-limiting toxic effects of trabectedin (phase 1) and the overall response rate (phase 2) with use of trabectedin plus irradiation in metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas.

Results

Eighteen patients (11 of whom were male) were enrolled in phase 1, and 27 other patients (14 of whom were female) were enrolled in phase 2. The median ages of those enrolled in phases 1 and 2 were 42 (range, 23–74) years and 51 (range, 27–73) years, respectively. In phase 1, dose-limiting toxic effects included grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 5 days in 1 patient at the starting dose level and a grade 4 alanine aminotransferase level increase in 1 of 6 patients at the +1 dose level. In phase 2, among 25 patients with evaluable data, the overall response rate was 72% (95% CI, 53%-91%) for local assessment and 60% (95% CI, 39%-81%) for central assessment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that the recommended dose of trabectedin for use in combination with this irradiation regimen is 1.5 mg/m2. The trial met its primary end point, with a high overall response rate that indicates the potential of this combination therapy for achieving substantial tumor shrinkage beyond first-line systemic therapy in patients with metastatic, progressing soft-tissue sarcomas.

### Gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line treatment in previously untreated advanced unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas (GeDDiS): a randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^112hZrf6]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

We chose 13 years as the minimum age for the trial, specifically to try to increase participation of the teenage and young adult population, because clinical trial recruitment of this age group is recognised to be poor. However, only one patient younger than 18 years of age was recruited, which we believe reflects the differing approaches to treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma by UK paediatric and adult oncologists — with paediatric oncologists using more intensive chemotherapy regimens than those used in this trial. Additionally, competing paediatric trials in this population were running in the UK at the time of recruitment to GeDDiS, such that we believe that younger patients were preferentially recruited to those paediatric trials.

Why did gemcitabine and docetaxel fail to show superiority to doxorubicin? This outcome might have been partly due to the choice of lower dose and fewer cycles of treatment; the 2002 study by Hensley and colleaguesdelivered more cycles (eight vs six), at higher doses (gemcitabine 900 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 vs gemcitabine 675 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 75 mg/m 2) than in GeDDiS. Our regimen was chosen on the basis of the randomised phase 2 study of Maki and colleagues, which had used the higher dose schedule, and had reported high frequency (46%) of dose reductions for gemcitabine and docetaxel, lower dose intensity than gemcitabine, and more than 40% of patients on gemcitabine and docetaxel stopping within 6 months of starting therapy, for non-haematological toxicities such as fatigue and myalgias, despite dose reductions. The authors concluded that "this dose and schedule… are too high for long-term use". Additionally, a previous phase 2 studythat the GeDDiS chief investigator had led using this schedule had found that quite substantial toxicity was experienced in the UK population, such that eight (18%) of 45 patients stopped treatment early due to toxicity, and only ten (20%) patients received the full eight cycles. We therefore made a pragmatic decision to dose modify the schedule to make it more suitable for patients receiving palliative chemotherapy. The lower doses used are reflected by the absence of grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia recorded (no patients on gemcitabine and docetaxel experienced this toxicity) compared with a 40% frequency in the previous randomised phase 2 study. It might be suggested that the gemcitabine and docetaxel doses we selected were too low. However, despite modifying the gemcitabine and docetaxel schedule for the GeDDiS trial, our results were similar for gemcitabine and docetaxel to those of Maki and colleagues' study, with median progression-free survival of 5.5 months versus 6.2 months, and median overall survival of 15.5 months versus 17.9 months, respectively.

With these considerations in mind, high-dose chemotherapy with G-CSF support could be defined as part of a multidisciplinary strategy in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas, to be performed at experienced institutions only. Its goal would be to induce the most effective antitumour response available, thereby preparing the ground for salvage therapies to improve the outcome further. And future research should focus on identifying patients that might benefit form such a combined treatment approach.

### Systemic treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: what is standard, what is new [^1161Aqhq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Trabectedin, a tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid currently approved both in Europe and USA for the treatment of advanced, refractory STS, also failed to show superiority as first-line treatment over doxorubicin in two phase 2 studies. The phase 2b TRUSTS trial, comparing doxorubicin with trabectedin single agent administered over two different schedules (3- and 24-h infusion), was terminated due to lack of superiority in both trabectedin treatment arms as compared to the control arm. Likewise, a phase 2 study from the Spanish Sarcoma Group comparing doxorubicin single agent with the combination of doxorubicin and trabectedin was stopped for futility after the interim analysis (median PFS was 5.5 and 5.7 months in the control and experimental arm, respectively).

Similar results have been reported in a first-line phase 2 study comparing brostallicin, a DNA minor-groove binder, with doxorubicin. Despite being well-tolerated, brostallicin was inferior to doxorubicin both for survival (1-year PFS; 6.5% vs. 15.6%; 1-year OS 50.5% vs. 57.9%) and objective response rate (RR; 3.9% vs. 22.2%).

The results from the studies above underline how, despite efforts over the last years, no regimens have succeeded in providing convincing evidence of superiority as upfront treatment compared to doxorubicin, which remains the standard of care, with or without the association with ifosfamide.

### Phase III trial of two investigational schedules of ifosfamide compared with standard-dose doxorubicin in advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma: a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer soft tissue and bone sarcoma group study [^114dXNzw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Single-agent doxorubicin remains the standard treatment for advanced soft tissue sarcomas. Combining doxorubicin with standard-dose ifosfamide has not been shown to improve survival and is associated with a significantly increased toxicity; it is not known whether higher dose single-agent ifosfamide is superior to doxorubicin.

Patients and Methods

This randomized prospective multicenter phase III trial was designed to compare progression-free survival of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma receiving either regimen of standard doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 every 21 days, ifosfamide 9 g/m2 over 3 days continuous infusion, or ifosfamide 3 g/m2 per day in 3 hours over 3 days. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, response rate, and toxicity.

Results

The study included 326 patients. Grade 4 leukopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and encephalopathy were more frequent in the ifosfamide arms. Progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rates were not significantly different between the three arms. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed the interim data and recommended early closure of the trial for futility (ie, no significant difference would be shown).

Conclusion

Single-agent doxorubicin remains the treatment of choice for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to YONDELIS in 755 patients with soft tissue sarcoma including 197 (26%) patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than or equal to 6 months and 57 (8%) patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than or equal to 1 year. The safety of YONDELIS was evaluated in six open-label, single-arm trials, in which 377 patients received YONDELIS and one open-label, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial in which 378 patients received YONDELIS (Trial ET743-SAR-3007). All patients received YONDELIS at the recommended dosing regimen of 1.5 mg/m2administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours once every 3 weeks (q3wk, 24-h). The median age was 54 years (range: 18 to 81 years), 63% were female, and all patients had metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

### Ecteinascidin-743 (ET-743) for chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas: multicenter phase II and pharmacokinetic study [^112YMdQH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the response rate, toxicity profile, and pharmacokinetics of ecteinascidin-743 (ET-743) as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

Patients and Methods

Thirty-six patients with STS were enrolled onto the study between September 1999 and August 2000. Patients were treated with 1.5 mg/m2 of ET-743 given as a 24-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusion every 21 days. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in 23 patients.

Results

One complete and five partial responses were achieved in 35 assessable patients for an overall response rate of 17.1% (95% CI, 6.6% to 33.6%). In addition, one patient had a minor response, leading to an overall clinical benefit of 20%. Neutropenia and transaminitis were the main grade 3 to 4 toxicities, which occurred in 33% and 36% of the patients. The estimated 1-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 21% (95% CI, 11% to 41%) and 72% (95% CI, 59% to 88%), respectively. Total body clearance (L/h) was not significantly correlated with body-surface area (r = -0.28; P = 0.21). Mild hepatic impairment or the extent of prior cytotoxic therapy does not seem to contribute significantly to the high interpatient variability (49%) in the clearance of this drug. Severity of treatment-related toxicity was not correlated with pharmacokinetic variables.

Conclusion

ET-743 demonstrates clinical activity as first-line therapy against STS with acceptable toxicity. Additional studies to establish empirical dosing guidelines may be necessary to improve the safety of the drug in patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction and definitively establish the role of ET-743 for patients with these malignancies.

### Trabectedin is a feasible treatment for soft tissue sarcoma patients regardless of patient age: a retrospective pooled analysis of five phase II trials [^112fPFud]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment delivery

Median number of cycles received was 3, ranging from 1 to 48 and 1 to 59 cycles for younger and older patients, respectively. Patients received a median dose intensity of 0.42 mg m –2 per week over a median treatment duration of 10 weeks (range: 3.0–181.1) in the younger and 0.40 mg m –2 per week over a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range: 3.0–236.7) in the older cohort (Table 2). In the younger and older cohort, 25.1% and 27.7% of patients received 7 or more cycles and 18.4% and 12.0% received 10 or more cycles, respectively, with a maximum of 48 and 59 cycles per cohort. Patients aged ⩾70 years had shorter median treatment duration (7.5 weeks; range: 3.0–37.3) mainly because of non-treatment-related events and received a median of two trabectedin cycles (range: 1−12). However, these patients reached a median dose intensity of 0.41 mg m –2 per week, representing 89% of the planned dose intensity, comparable with that given to patients younger than 70 years (Table 2).

Response rate and survival

Regarding the overall trabectedin activity, the ORR was 10.0% (2 CR and 33 PR; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.1–13.6%) with no significant differences between patients aged < 60 years (10.1%) and ⩾60 years (9.6%). A numerically lower overall ORR (1 PR, 4.2% 95% CI: 1.1–21.1%) was observed among the 24 patients aged ⩾70 years. SD was recorded in 40.4%, 47.0% and 45.8% of patients aged < 60, ⩾60 and ⩾70 years, respectively, and 17.2%, 21.7% and 20.8% of whom maintained SD for ⩾6 months for an DCR of 27.3%, 31.3% and 25.0% in each of these age-based groups (Table 3).

### Doxorubicin alone versus intensified doxorubicin plus ifosfamide for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma: a randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^111F5b6x]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective targeted treatment is unavailable for most sarcomas and doxorubicin and ifosfamide-which have been used to treat soft-tissue sarcoma for more than 30 years-still have an important role. Whether doxorubicin alone or the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide should be used routinely is still controversial. We assessed whether dose intensification of doxorubicin with ifosfamide improves survival of patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma compared with doxorubicin alone.

Methods

We did this phase 3 randomised controlled trial (EORTC 62012) at 38 hospitals in ten countries. We included patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma, age 18–60 years with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. They were randomly assigned (1:1) by the minimisation method to either doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) by intravenous bolus on day 1 or 72 h continuous intravenous infusion) or intensified doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2); 25 mg/m(2) per day, days 1–3) plus ifosfamide (10 g/m(2) over 4 days with mesna and pegfilgrastim) as first-line treatment. Randomisation was stratified by centre, performance status (0 vs 1), age (< 50 vs ≥ 50 years), presence of liver metastases, and histopathological grade (2 vs 3). Patients were treated every 3 weeks till progression or unacceptable toxic effects for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00061984.

Findings

Between April 30, 2003, and May 25, 2010, 228 patients were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin and 227 to receive doxorubicin and ifosfamide. Median follow-up was 56 months (IQR 31–77) in the doxorubicin only group and 59 months (36–72) in the combination group. There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups (median overall survival 12.8 months [95.5% CI 10.5–14.3] in the doxorubicin group vs 14.3 months [12.5–16.5] in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.83 [95.5% CI 0.67–1.03]; stratified log-rank test p = 0.076). Median progression-free survival was significantly higher for the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group (7.4 months [95% CI 6.6–8.3]) than for the doxorubicin group (4.6 months [2.9–5.6]; HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.60–0.90], stratified log-rank test p = 0.003). More patients in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group than in the doxorubicin group had an overall response (60 [26%] of 227 patients vs 31 [14%] of 228; p < 0.0006). The most common grade 3 and 4 toxic effects-which were all more common with doxorubicin and ifosfamide than with doxorubicin alone-were leucopenia (97 [43%] of 224 patients vs 40 [18%] of 223 patients), neutropenia (93 [42%] vs 83 [37%]), febrile neutropenia (103 (46%) vs 30 [13%]), anaemia (78 [35%] vs 10 [5%]), and thrombocytopenia (75 [33%]) vs one [< 1%]).

Interpretation

Our results do not support the use of intensified doxorubicin and ifosfamide for palliation of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma unless the specific goal is tumour shrinkage. These findings should help individualise the care of patients with this disease.

### Potential combination chemotherapy approaches for advanced adult-type soft-tissue sarcoma [^116QkC1D]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) include a spectrum of histologically and clinically different tumors. Patients with these tumors are typically relatively young and the course of disease is characterized by early metastasis as well as limited response to chemotherapy. However, a few subtypes, such as small round-cell tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma (other than pleomorphic), are considered chemotherapy sensitive. In addition, reflecting successful translational research of recent years, gastrointestinal stromal tumor and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans have become model diseases for targeted oncologic therapy. We summarize current treatment options for metastatic STS, including established first-line chemotherapy approaches, mainly with anthracyclines and/or ifosfamide and second-line treatment choices beyond anthracyclines. Until only a few years ago, treatment choices for metastatic STS were easy to review because of the very limited number of active compounds available. However, with the advent of novel therapeutic strategies such as the anti-angiogenic approach and a multitude of novel compounds available both outside and within clinical studies, it has potentially become more difficult to keep track of currently available treatment options for STS and their clinical safety and efficacy. In this practice-oriented article, we therefore review treatment goals in advanced STS and provide an overview of compounds with proven activity in this setting. Anthracyclines with or without ifosfamide are still considered standard of care for most STS subtypes, especially for high-grade tumors. There is no evidence-based recommendation regarding use of second-line treatment options. However, a number of established compounds, including dacarbazine/temozolomide, gemcitabine, taxanes, trofosfamide, DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors, DNA minor groove binders, and bendamustine have shown activity. Recently, trabectedin, a DNA minor groove binder initially isolated from a sea sponge, has proven effective and received European approval for use in treatment-refractory STS. In addition, novel compounds such as bevacizumab, multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, imatinib, and the thrombospondin agonist ABT 510 represent attractive partners for the above-mentioned cytostatic agents, or may even be effective single agents in the clinically advanced setting. Novel combinations are being evaluated in clinical studies. In order to be successful, it may be necessary to combine not only different compounds but also different targets beyond the proliferation machinery of sarcoma cells such as tumor angiogenesis, the tumor stromal compartment, or tumor cell oncogene products.

### Treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcomas using a combined strategy of high-dose ifosfamide, high-dose doxorubicin and salvage therapies [^1125tp6t]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In a previous phase I trial, we identified the maximum tolerated dose levels for combined administration of ifosfamide and doxorubicin. The phase II trial herein presented was required to confirm the increased response rate suggested in that previous trial. It has successfully accomplished this purpose by demonstrating a response rate of 48% (95% CI: 33–63%) in 46 patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas. Although this observed response rate did not reach the requirement being considered promising as defined by the statistical design, it is in the range of similar response rates (40–66%) for high-dose combination of ifosfamide and doxorubicin that have been obtained in other phase-II studies. The most recent trials have yielded less impressive response rates (25–23%) but were designed such that only one agent was administered at high dose levels. Indeed, the efficacy of ifosfamide alone at standard dose (5 g m −2) was shown to be minimal (10%) in a randomised trial. Moreover the best schedule of ifosfamide administration is still unknown. There were suggestions that daily 2- to 4 h-infusion might be more active than continuous infusion, but might be also more toxic.

Gemcitabine-based combinations in advanced STS — phase II data show: In a randomized phase II study, gemcitabine plus docetaxel achieved superior progression-free survival (PFS) (6.2 months and 3.0 months, respectively) and OS (17.9 months and 11.5 months, respectively) compared to gemcitabine alone in metastatic STS. In another phase II study, gemcitabine plus vinorelbine was associated with clinically meaningful rates of disease control, with clinical benefit seen in 25% of patients. Gemcitabine plus dacarbazine resulted in superior PFS (4.2 months vs. 2 months; P = 0.005), OS (16.8 months vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.014), and objective response rate (49% vs. 25%; P = 0.009) compared to dacarbazine alone in previously treated advanced STS.

Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery to remove the tumor. When given before surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy. When given after surgery to remove all of the tumor that can be seen, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will kill any remaining cancer cells. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.

### Radiation therapy for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^114GbS5f]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the indications for radiation therapy (RT), sequencing of local therapies, and appropriate dose and planning techniques for management of primary, operable, localized, soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in adults.

Methods

The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 5 key questions focused on the use of RT for management of STS. These questions included indications for RT for STS of the extremity and superficial trunk; considerations for sequencing of RT with respect to surgery, dose of RT, appropriate treatment volumes and techniques; and the role of RT in management of retroperitoneal sarcoma. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.

Results

Multidisciplinary evaluation and decision making are recommended for all cases of STS. RT is recommended for patients in whom there is increased risk of local recurrence of resected STS, particularly if close or microscopically positive margins are anticipated or have occurred. When RT is indicated, preoperative RT is strongly recommended over postoperative RT. Postoperative RT is conditionally recommended in specific clinical circumstances (eg, uncontrolled pain or bleeding) or when the risk of wound complications outweighs that of late toxicity from RT. Routine use of RT in addition to oncologic resection for retroperitoneal sarcoma is conditionally not recommended. When RT is used for retroperitoneal sarcoma, preoperative RT is recommended, whereas postoperative RT is not recommended.

Conclusions

Based on currently published data, the American Society for Radiation Oncology task force has proposed evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of RT for STS in adults. Future studies will ascertain whether alterations in dosing and sequencing may optimize outcomes and quality of life.

Selection of SACT

Treatment of advanced disease may involve other modalities such as radiotherapy or surgery, and so multidisciplinary team review is important. Systemic treatment should ideally be guided by established protocols, preferably shared nationally and internationally. There is potential variability in dosing and administration, particularly in the use of agents such as ifosfamide, and care should be taken to use treatment protocols that maximise benefit whilst ensuring optimal management, and minimisation, of potential toxicities. Techniques such as the use of ambulatory infusions can be used to enhance patient convenience, and free-up valuable inpatient resources.

In a cost-constrained health system there is a challenge to fund all active agents, particularly in rare diseases. Some of the treatments considered may fall outside current standard NHS funding, and this will have to be taken into account when discussing the options with patients.

In most cases of metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma the choice of first-line chemotherapy will be between single-agent doxorubicin, or combined doxorubicin and ifosfamide. In a European trial a dose-intense ifosfamide/doxorubicin combination did not improve survival, but did deliver a higher response rate and improved progression-free survival, though at the cost of increased toxicity. This may be an important consideration if the patient is symptomatic due to tumour size, or a reduction in tumour volume might facilitate other treatment options. The performance status of the patient and comorbidities will play an important role in treatment selection particularly in view of potential cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin and renal toxicity seen with ifosfamide. An option in locally advanced, or metastatic leiomyosarcoma where a higher response rate is desired, is the combination of doxorubicin and dacarbazine which, in a multi-centre retrospective study appears, more effective than doxorubicin alone or combined with ifosfamide.

NCCN Guidelines — adult rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) management guidance: These guidelines strongly recommend that all patients should be referred to institutions with expertise in treating patients with RMS, and evaluation by a multidisciplinary team involving pediatric, medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists is strongly encouraged. Multimodality treatment (surgery, RT, and chemotherapy) planning and risk stratification is required for all patients, and PET imaging may be useful for initial staging because of the possibility of nodal metastases and the appearance of unusual sites of initial metastatic disease in adult patients. Systemic chemotherapy options for RMS may be different than those used with other STS histologies; pleomorphic RMS is usually excluded from RMS randomized clinical trials and consideration to treat according to STS guidelines may be warranted for this group of patients. In the absence of data from prospective clinical trials, there are no definitive, optimal regimens for the management of adult RMS. See Systemic Therapy Agents and Regimens with Activity in Soft Tissue Sarcoma in the algorithm for a list of chemotherapy regimens that are recommended for the management of adults with RMS.

Procedures

Patients received either intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m 2 on day 1 every 3 weeks, or intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m 2 on day 1 and intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m 2 followed by intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 on day 8 every 3 weeks. Gemcitabine was administered over 90 min and docetaxel was administered over 60 min. Dose capping according to sites' local policy and dose banding to within plus or minus 5% of the calculated dose were permitted. Pre-treatment and post-treatment anti-emetics were given for all trial treatments, as per local anti-emetics policy. In both groups, patients completed up to six cycles of treatment in the absence of disease progression, intolerable side-effects, or withdrawal of consent.

Laboratory monitoring (blood count and biochemistry) was done within 72 h of day 1 of each cycle, with additional monitoring on day 8 (blood count only) for gemcitabine and docetaxel treatment. To proceed with treatment on day 1 of each cycle (both groups) the following were required: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1.0 × 10 9 per L, platelet count of at least 100 × 10 9 per L, bilirubin of up to 1.5 × ULN, and aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or both of up to 3.0 × ULN. For administration of treatment on day 8 (in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group) the following were required: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1.0 × 10 9 per L and platelets of at least 75 × 10 9 per L. Dose modifications for adverse events were made according to prespecified criteria: dose reductions of 20% (first occurrence) ND then 33% (second occurrence) were permitted for doxorubicin (in the case of grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia) and gemcitabine and docetaxel (for grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia, grade 2 neuropathy, or any grade pulmonary toxicity); a third occurrence required the patient to be withdrawn from treatment. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was permitted after an episode of febrile neutropenia, at the discretion of the treating investigator and according to local policy. Dose delays of up to 2 weeks for haematological toxicity and up to 3 weeks for non-haematological toxicity were allowed; delays longer than this required the patient to be withdrawn from treatment. For doxorubicin, patients were advised to be withdrawn from treatment if left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 45% or reduced by 20% from baseline (cardiotoxicity monitoring was done according to local institutional policies). For gemcitabine and docetaxel, patients were withdrawn for the following events: grade 3 pulmonary fibrosis, any grade 4 pulmonary toxicity, grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions (docetaxel only), or grade 3 weight gain.

The guidance also states "Be supportive if your patient wants to pursue a second opinion", emphasizing that "A second opinion is not indicative of mistrust or lack of respect for your medical abilities, rather it is a chance for patients to feel that they have some control over their own situation, and in many cases it is an opportunity for patients to get confirmation that they are making the best decision for themselves". Additional recommendations include "Engage your patients as part of the team by including them in the decision-making process" and "Be cautious when throwing around medical jargon", since "patients are not always used to hearing it, especially in the beginning, and it can provoke anxiety". Supportive care messaging further advises "Encourage your patients to seek out psych-oncology support", "Recognize and respect the unique needs of the adolescent and young adult (AYA) patient population and learn about the myriad of resources available to this group", and "If you would like your patients to stay off the internet, provide reputable online resources if they want to research their diagnosis/treatment plan. They will feel empowered". The guideline also notes "Do not be afraid to talk about sexual side effects" because "Your patients may be afraid to ask, but they want to know what to expect and how to manage it".

### Olaratumab and doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone for treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma: an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 trial [^116u4ZJY]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment with doxorubicin is a present standard of care for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and median overall survival for those treated is 12–16 months, but few, if any, novel treatments or chemotherapy combinations have been able to improve these poor outcomes. Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody that has antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenografts. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaratumab plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.

Methods

We did an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 study of doxorubicin plus olaratumab treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma at 16 clinical sites in the USA. For both the phase 1b and phase 2 parts of the study, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma not previously treated with an anthracycline, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2, and available tumour tissue to determine PDGFRα expression by immunohistochemistry. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) or doxorubicin alone (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to eight cycles. Randomisation was dynamic and used the minimisation randomisation technique. The phase 1b primary endpoint was safety and the phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a two-sided α level of 0.2 and statistical power of 0.8. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01185964.

Findings

15 patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin in the phase 1b study, and 133 patients were randomised (66 to olaratumab plus doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin alone) in the phase 2 trial, 129 (97%) of whom received at least one dose of study treatment (64 received olaratumab plus doxorubicin, 65 received doxorubicin). Median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 6.6 months (95% CI 4.1–8.3) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 4.1 months (2.8–5.4) with doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 0.44–1.02, p = 0.0615). Median overall survival was 26.5 months (20.9–31.7) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 14.7 months (9.2–17.1) with doxorubicin (stratified HR 0.46, 0.30–0.71, p = 0.0003). The objective response rate was 18.2% (9.8–29.6) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 11.9% (5.3–22.2) with doxorubicin (p = 0.3421). Steady state olaratumab serum concentrations were reached during cycle 3 with mean maximum and trough concentrations ranging from 419 μg/mL (geometric coefficient of variation in percentage [CV%] 26.2) to 487 μg/mL (CV% 33.0) and from 123 μg/mL (CV% 31.2) to 156 μg/mL (CV% 38.0), respectively. Adverse events that were more frequent with olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone included neutropenia (37 [58%] vs 23 [35%]), mucositis (34 [53%] vs 23 [35%]), nausea (47 [73%] vs 34 [52%]), vomiting (29 [45%] vs 12 [18%]), and diarrhoea (22 [34%] vs 15 [23%]). Febrile neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was similar in both groups (olaratumab plus doxorubicin: eight [13%] of 64 patients vs doxorubicin: nine [14%] of 65 patients).

Interpretation

This study of olaratumab with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma met its predefined primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly significant improvement of 11.8 months in median overall survival, suggesting a potential shift in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma.

2.3 Outcomes

Aim of the study was to confirm that the combination of T plus RT is feasible and safe and shows potential synergic activity with low toxicity.

The primary end-point was to describe the safety profile of the combination of T plus RT in order to find the recommended T dose for the phase II part of the study.

Secondary end-points were radiological response, measured by RECIST 1.1 and Choi criteria, and pathological response; recurrence free survival (RFS), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS); quality of Life measured by QLQ-C30 EORTC questionnaire.

2.4 Statistical Analysis

We did a 3 + 3 dose escalation with review of available safety before initiating the next dose level. Sample size for dose escalation was based on the 3 + 3 design rules with three to six patients per dose level. Three patients were treated at a given dose level. If at least 2 patients were observed to have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the prior dose level was defined as the maximum tolerable dosage (MTD) (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative MTD). If 0 of the 3 patients were observed to have DLT, the dose level was escalated one step for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continued as above. If exactly 1 of the 3 patients treated showed DLT, 3 additional patients were treated at the current dose level. If none of these additional 3 patients showed DLT, the dose level was escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above; otherwise, the prior dose level was defined as the MTD.

The dose-escalation levels were: − 1: Trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2; 0: Trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 and 1: Trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2. The starting dose-level was 1.3 mg/m 2 and it was designed a de-escalation dose (− 1) of 1.1 mg/m 2 in the case of observing more than one DLT over 6 patients in the starting dose, and one escalation dose (1) at 1.5 mg/m 2, the ceiling dose recommended for trabectedin, in case of finding ≤ 1 DLT in the starting dose. It was not allowed de-escalating or escalating the dose on an individual basis, beside the defined dose reductions according to the protocol.
