## Question

Loe level of erythrocytes and hemoglobin high levwl of platelets and ESR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a patient with low erythrocytes and hemoglobin, high platelets, and elevated ESR, and to refine it into a stepwise expert analysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core hematologic pattern and its most likely etiologies. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and prioritize it. Next, I will outline the immediate diagnostic workup, including iron studies, inflammatory markers, and smear. After that, I need to consider when to pursue myeloproliferative testing and bone marrow evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a working diagnosis and lay out initial management and follow-up, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the hematologic pattern and its clinical significance. Low erythrocytes and hemoglobin indicate anemia, while an elevated platelet count signifies thrombocytosis; concurrently elevated ESR reflects systemic inflammation, and together this triad is classically seen in chronic inflammatory states, particularly anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia with reactive thrombocytosis, and is also common in active inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic inflammatory conditions [^114khZJE] [^117NmNr4] [^1131NEtE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a prioritized differential. The most likely etiologies include anemia of chronic disease with reactive thrombocytosis, iron deficiency anemia with reactive thrombocytosis, and active inflammatory bowel disease given the strong association of anemia and thrombocytosis with IBD activity; less likely but important considerations include myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, essential thrombocythemia, and other myeloproliferative neoplasms, as well as occult malignancy or chronic infection; I need to ensure I keep both reactive and clonal causes in view and let the labs guide me stepwise [^114khZJE] [^117NmNr4] [^114EUrzm] [^1131VoXA] [^116yS7mA].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic workup to separate iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease and to characterize the thrombocytosis. I will order a CBC with differential and red cell indices, reticulocyte count, iron studies including ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and transferrin, inflammatory markers including CRP alongside ESR, and a peripheral blood smear to assess morphology; in parallel, I should check liver and renal function, and consider fecal occult blood testing if gastrointestinal blood loss is plausible, because these results will anchor the anemia classification and the likelihood of a reactive versus clonal thrombocytosis [^114AKt1p] [^116116vp] [^117NmNr4].

> Wait, let me verify how to interpret the iron studies in the context of inflammation. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be normal or elevated despite iron deficiency when inflammation is present, so low ferritin is specific for iron deficiency, whereas normal or high ferritin with low transferrin saturation and low serum iron supports anemia of chronic disease; a high RDW in the setting of microcytosis strengthens the diagnosis of iron deficiency, and a low reticulocyte count suggests underproduction consistent with inflammatory or iron-restricted erythropoiesis; the smear can show microcytosis and hypochromia in iron deficiency, and target cells or other abnormalities may hint at alternative etiologies [^114AKt1p] [^116116vp].

> I will now examine the thrombocytosis more closely. Reactive thrombocytosis is far more common than clonal, especially in iron deficiency and inflammatory states; if the platelet count exceeds roughly 450 × 10⁹/L, I should confirm persistence on repeat testing, review for bleeding, infection, inflammation, and malignancy, and proceed with iron studies and inflammatory markers; if iron deficiency is corrected and the platelet count normalizes, that strongly supports a reactive process, whereas persistent unexplained thrombocytosis warrants evaluation for myeloproliferative neoplasm [^1131VoXA] [^115dVSvN] [^115HbiS5].

> But wait, what if the thrombocytosis persists or the clinical picture suggests a myeloproliferative process. I should double-check for clonal etiologies by ordering JAK2 V617F mutation testing, and if negative and suspicion remains, CALR and MPL; if cytopenias or dysplasia are present, I should consider bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetics to evaluate for MDS or overlap syndromes; these steps align with contemporary guidance to exclude reactive causes before labeling a myeloproliferative neoplasm and to use WHO criteria for ET and related disorders [^114RezYt] [^117FrQx7] [^1131VoXA] [^112LM63t].

> Let me consider the role and limitations of ESR and CRP so I do not overinterpret a single marker. ESR is nonspecific and influenced by age, sex, anemia, and fibrinogen, and it rises and falls more slowly than CRP; paired testing can show discordance, and in many inflammatory conditions CRP is more dynamic for monitoring, so I should prioritize CRP for treatment response tracking while using ESR as supportive context rather than a standalone diagnostic tool [^114Zimnf] [^115DPZX9].

> I should confirm whether the clinical context points toward inflammatory bowel disease or another gastrointestinal source of blood loss. In patients with suspected IBD, anemia and thrombocytosis are common, and guidelines recommend CBC, ESR, CRP, and albumin as part of initial assessment; if iron deficiency is confirmed, I should treat it and monitor for hematologic response, and if IBD is suspected, appropriate endoscopic and imaging evaluations should follow to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^114khZJE] [^117NmNr4] [^114AKt1p].

> Let me synthesize a working diagnosis based on probabilities. Given the triad of anemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated ESR, the most likely diagnosis is anemia of chronic disease with reactive thrombocytosis, with iron deficiency anemia as a close alternative or coexisting process; active inflammatory bowel disease remains a leading inflammatory driver to consider, particularly if gastrointestinal symptoms or occult blood are present; less likely but important alternatives include MDS with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, essential thrombocythemia, and occult malignancy, which I should keep in mind if the thrombocytosis fails to respond to correction of iron deficiency or if cytogenetic or morphologic clues emerge [^114khZJE] [^114EUrzm] [^1131VoXA] [^116yS7mA].

> Next, I should review initial management while the diagnostic workup is pending. I will treat presumed iron deficiency if ferritin is low or transferrin saturation is low, using oral iron and reassessing the CBC in 2 to 4 weeks to confirm reticulocytosis and rising hemoglobin; if anemia of chronic disease predominates, I will address the underlying inflammatory condition and consider erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in select chronic kidney disease contexts; for thrombocytosis, unless there is extreme thrombocytosis or bleeding, I will avoid antiplatelet therapy initially and focus on correcting the cause, reserving cytoreduction for clonal disease or high-risk scenarios; I will also monitor CRP to track inflammatory activity and adjust therapy accordingly [^114AKt1p] [^111MCERg] [^1131VoXA] [^114Zimnf].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and safety nets. I will repeat the CBC and iron studies 2 to 4 weeks after starting iron to ensure hematologic recovery and platelet normalization, which would support a reactive thrombocytosis; if the platelet count remains elevated beyond 450 × 10⁹/L despite correction of iron deficiency, or if cytopenias, dysplasia, or other atypical features appear, I will escalate to molecular testing and bone marrow evaluation; throughout, I will correlate with clinical symptoms, review medications, and screen for gastrointestinal blood loss or other sources of chronic inflammation to maintain diagnostic discipline [^114AKt1p] [^1131VoXA] [^112LM63t].

The combination of **low erythrocytes/hemoglobin with high platelets and ESR** most often reflects **anemia of chronic disease or iron deficiency** with reactive thrombocytosis and elevated ESR from inflammation or infection [^114AKt1p] [^117NmNr4]. Less commonly, it signals **myeloproliferative neoplasms** (e.g. ET, PV) or **myelodysplastic syndromes**; evaluate with iron studies, B12/folate, reticulocytes, LDH, haptoglobin, direct antiglobulin test, and peripheral smear, then consider JAK2/CALR/MPL, bone marrow biopsy, and imaging as indicated [^1131VoXA] [^112LM63t]. Management targets the **underlying cause**: treat iron deficiency, control inflammation/infection, and use cytoreduction/antithrombotic therapy for clonal thrombocytosis [^112LM63t] [^1131VoXA].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Anemia

Anemia in this context includes **anemia of chronic disease (ACD)** — a normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia with elevated ESR/CRP and reactive thrombocytosis from chronic inflammation (e.g. IBD, RA, malignancy, chronic infection) [^114khZJE] [^1131NEtE] — and **iron deficiency anemia (IDA)**, which is microcytic, hypochromic, and often accompanied by reactive thrombocytosis and elevated ESR in the setting of inflammation or infection [^114AKt1p] [^113J8YNH]. Chronic kidney disease can also cause normocytic anemia with elevated ESR due to uremic inflammation [^notfound].

---

### Thrombocytosis

- **Reactive thrombocytosis**: Common with iron deficiency, inflammation, infection, or malignancy; platelets usually < 600–800 × 10⁹/L and normalize with treatment of the cause [^115HbiS5] [^116yS7mA].

- **Essential thrombocythemia (ET)**: A clonal MPN with persistent thrombocytosis ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L; may coexist with anemia or elevated ESR and requires molecular testing (JAK2, CALR, MPL) and bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis [^1131VoXA].

- **Polycythemia vera (PV)**: Typically presents with erythrocytosis, but anemia can occur with bleeding or marrow fibrosis; JAK2 mutation is present in > 95% of cases [^1172nQUo].

---

### Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

Elevated ESR reflects **inflammation or infection** — common in chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g. IBD, RA, SLE), infections (e.g. TB, endocarditis, osteomyelitis), and malignancy — and is also seen in **myeloproliferative neoplasms**, where elevated ESR may accompany MPNs such as ET or PV [^117NmNr4] [^114iBsPW].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial laboratory evaluation

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Assess anemia severity, platelet count, and white blood cell indices [^111MCERg].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Evaluate red cell morphology (microcytosis, macrocytosis, anisopoikilocytosis), platelet morphology, and abnormal cells [^114EUrzm].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, TIBC to differentiate IDA from ACD [^114AKt1p].

- **Vitamin B12 and folate levels**: Rule out nutritional deficiencies causing anemia [^111MCERg].

- **Reticulocyte count**: Assess marrow response; low in ACD/IDA, high in hemolysis or blood loss [^114AKt1p].

- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, direct antiglobulin test (DAT)**: Evaluate hemolysis [^114AKt1p].

- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP to corroborate ESR and assess inflammation severity [^117NmNr4].

---

### Further investigations based on initial results

- **JAK2, CALR, MPL mutation analysis**: If clonal thrombocytosis or MPN is suspected [^1131VoXA].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated for suspected MPNs, MDS, or unexplained cytopenias/thrombocytosis [^112LM63t].

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to identify occult malignancy, infection, or organomegaly [^113xPqx3].

- **Infection screening**: Serologies, cultures, or PCR for suspected infections (e.g. TB, endocarditis, osteomyelitis) [^115mBWHo].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Anemia

Management focuses on correcting **iron deficiency** with iron replacement and treating the underlying cause [^112LM63t]; **anemia of chronic disease** is managed by controlling the inflammatory process and considering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in selected cases [^111MCERg].

---

### Thrombocytosis

For reactive thrombocytosis, treat the underlying cause and monitor for resolution [^115HbiS5]; for **essential thrombocythemia**, use cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha) and low-dose aspirin to reduce thrombotic risk [^1131VoXA].

---

### Elevated ESR

Management targets the **underlying inflammatory or infectious condition** through appropriate medical or surgical therapy [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**. Reactive thrombocytosis and anemia from inflammation or iron deficiency generally resolve with treatment, whereas myeloproliferative neoplasms carry a risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation and require long-term management and surveillance [^1131VoXA] [^115HbiS5].

---

The combination of low erythrocytes/hemoglobin, high platelets, and elevated ESR most often reflects **anemia of chronic disease or iron deficiency** with reactive thrombocytosis and inflammation, but clonal disorders like ET or MDS must be excluded. A structured workup with iron studies, hemolysis tests, inflammatory markers, and selective molecular testing guides diagnosis and management, which should focus on treating the underlying cause and mitigating thrombotic risk when indicated [^114AKt1p] [^1131VoXA].

Results

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114khZJE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^1131NEtE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis, is crucial. As noted above, the physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases may be in respiratory distress.

Laboratory tests

Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactic acid, uric acid and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional, due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases, and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are typically elevated, especially in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum lipase and amylase levels are often normal or mildly elevated in pancreatic ascites, thereby rendering these tests non-diagnostic.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

### Cervical epidural abscess associated with massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [^117RY11x]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with neck pain, low-grade fever, bandemia, and a massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) who had a cervical epidural abscess. We believe that the selective use of ESR assisted in narrowing the differential diagnosis, as the patient had no neurological deficits and no predisposing factors such as distal infection, immunosuppression, trauma, or recent surgery. Furthermore, in the literature, an elevated ESR is consistently found in patients with epidural abscesses, whereas clinical findings such as fever, leukocytosis, and neurological deficits are only variably present.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

### Approach to patients with essential thrombocythaemia and very high platelet counts: what is the evidence for treatment? [^1138BuPS]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is directed at decreasing the risk of complications of the disease, including arterial and venous thrombosis and bleeding episodes. Established risk factors for vascular events in patients with ET include advanced age (> 60 years) and prior history of thrombosis or haemorrhage. The role, if any, of other potential risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, leucocytosis, high haematocrit, and JAK2 V617F has been analysed in multiple studies. The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking. In this review, we discuss current treatment recommendations for patients with ET, the biology underlying vascular events and risk factors thereof. We then review the evidence on the management of patients with ET and extreme thrombocytosis.

### Why shouldn' T we determine the erythrocyte sedimentation rate? [^115DPZX9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A test that is meant to measure a given parameter is more likely to detect changes in that parameter if it is not affected by factors other than those which it is intended to quantitate. The clinical use of the laboratory test for determining the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is backed by nearly a century of experience. Although its nonspecificity is acknowledged, it has been used to quantitate the inflammatory process that underlies infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. I believe that this venerable test is affected by too many factors in addition to that which we think we are measuring, to the point that its clinical usefulness is severely compromised.

COVID-19–associated thrombosis — pathophysiology, risk factors, and uncertainty are summarized: VTE has emerged as an important clinical complication for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with early reports documenting high rates of VTE despite pharmacological thromboprophylaxis; arterial thrombotic complications including stroke have been noted; mechanisms remain not fully elucidated with hemostatic abnormalities such as elevations in factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and D-dimer; reported predictors and risk factors include elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and older age; the optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy remains uncertain and it remains unclear whether these parameters should be used to stratify risk or influence thromboprophylaxis intensity.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

### How we diagnose and treat essential thrombocythaemia [^115xfPuR]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The approach to the diagnosis and management of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is steadily changing, influenced by advances in molecular biology, data from clinical trials and retrospective analyses of patient cohorts. In the past decade options for clinical management largely remain unchanged, but who we treat, and with what target in mind, is evolving. A further area of change is recognition of symptoms that may be associated with ET, as well as other myeloproliferative neoplasms, and that potential options for their management are becoming available. Judicious and careful diagnosis is increasingly a fundamental key to successful management followed by cytoreductive therapy in a subset of patients. In this review we demonstrate our management strategies for ET using a case-based format.

### Child with suspected excessive cortisol production [^1137NcU9]. PES (2021). High credibility.

Child with suspected Cushing syndrome — laboratory evaluation includes an overnight dexamethasone suppression test in which a single dose of 1 mg of dexamethasone given close to 11 pm should suppress the AM cortisol to < 1.8 ug/dl (50 nmol/L), and a midnight salivary cortisol that is a good screening test to rule out Cushings. Additional laboratory testing lists low and high dose dexamethasone suppression test, a corticotrophin releasing hormone test, and a complete metabolic panel, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plus vitamin D levels, calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels; blood glucose can be elevated with possible glycosuria, frank diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance can develop in children with hypercortilism, hematological and immune dysfunction with cortisol stimulating erythropoiesis leading to polycythemia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia are common, and as cortisol affects vitamin D absorption in the intestines and increased loss of calcium from the kidneys there is often osteopenia/osteoporosis.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — Historically, case series have described ESR elevation in 90% to 100% of children with AHO, but rates as low as 70% to 87% also have been reported, and ESR combined with CRP may slightly improve sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AHO, but specific thresholds and the overall clinical utility of using both CRP and ESR for diagnostic purposes remain uncertain. The ESR tends to rise more slowly than CRP in acute infection and to decrease more slowly than CRP in an appropriately treated infection; the ESR is no longer used routinely to diagnose AHO in children.

Essential thrombocythemia is a distinct clinical entity within the spectrum of myeloproliferative disorders. There is as yet no pathognomonic diagnostic test, and patients who currently fall into the category of essential thrombocythemia are likely to be heterogeneous. This article discusses diagnostic criteria, clinical features, prognosis, and management.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^114NthJk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count can be elevated but is in the normal range in most children, and the accuracy of the WBC count for the diagnosis of AHO is less than that of CRP; WBC count may be higher on average with MRSA etiology and in complicated cases, yet WBC counts overlap considerably among these etiologies and scenarios and do not provide discriminatory value. The information provided by a CBC can provide important adjunctive information for decision-making for children with suspected or confirmed AHO, and anemia and reactive thrombocytosis may be seen in some children with AHO at presentation.

All patients displayed recurrent and simultaneously occurring inflammatory manifestations, frequently triggered by cold exposure (31%) or stress (31%). The most frequent manifestations at diagnosis included urticaria-like rash (100%), arthralgia (87%), recurrent fever (75%), arthritis (68%), and headache (56%) (Table 1; Fig. 2). Before starting anti-IL-1 treatment, nearly all patients presented marked analytical perturbations. The most frequent hematological abnormalities included low mean hemoglobin concentration (14/16 patients; 87.5%), increased mean neutrophil count (14/16 patients; 87.5%), increased mean leukocyte count (12/16 patients; 75.0%), and increased mean platelet count (7/16 patients; 43.75%) (Supplementary Table S2, and Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Among biochemical tests, a moderate-to-high increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum concentration was detected in nearly all patients (87.5% and 100%, respectively) (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S3). As two different groups were identified based on age at disease onset, we performed a comparative analysis of their disease manifestations, with the results being shown in the Fig. 2 and in the Supplementary Table S4.

Laboratory Data

Laboratory data at the time of diagnosis are also summarized in Figure 1. An ESR ≥ 50 mm/h and a CRP level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL were recorded in 91% and 65% of our patients, respectively. In addition, anemia with hemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dL was detected in 59%, whereas a platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L was an unusual finding, occurring in ~20%. Of note, seven patients with combined anemia and thrombocytosis experienced a relapse of ocular symptoms 2–5 months after achieving disease remission and while still receiving tapered doses of glucocorticoids (GCs).

### Laboratory values for children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease [^11574pZT]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to determine how often common laboratory tests yield normal results at the time of diagnosis for children with inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods

Data were obtained from a registry of children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease who were enrolled prospectively in 18 US/Canadian centers. Laboratory values investigated included hemoglobin level, platelet count, albumin level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Disease severity was categorized by physician global assessment.

Results

A total of 526 children (mean age: 11.6 years; 58% male; 392 with Crohn disease and 134 with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All 4 values were normal for 21% of patients with mild Crohn disease and 54% with mild ulcerative colitis. In contrast, only 3.8% of children with moderate/severe Crohn disease and 4.3% with moderate/severe ulcerative colitis had normal results for all 4 tests. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was least likely to be normal; overall, 26% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, including 18% with moderate/severe disease. Hemoglobin levels were normal for 32%, platelet counts for 50%, and albumin levels for 60%. There was no clear association between Crohn disease location and either severity or number of normal laboratory values. In contrast, there were direct correlations between ulcerative colitis disease severity and both the extent of bowel inflammation and the number of abnormal laboratory tests.

Conclusion

The presence of normal screening laboratory studies should not dissuade clinicians from considering a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.

There are so few true haematological emergencies that they are often way down the list as a differential diagnosis. Those that do exist, however, can prove devastatingly fatal if left untreated and a case is presented of one such possible diagnosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which falls into the remit of many possible presenting conditions. Particularly prevalent in young adults, this condition must always be thought of in any patient presenting with confusion, renal impairment, fever or other neurological abnormalities.

Approach to diagnostic testing when considering

Laboratory testing. Because most patients with vasculitis do not have hematologic malignancy, we do not exhaustively test all patients with a new diagnosis of vasculitis with a bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry, for example. However, we always consider the presteroid complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential and, if available, the historic CBC with differential trend as a vital piece of diagnostic information to integrate with other diagnostic testing that, from our hematologic evaluation minimally, includes erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum‐free light chains (SFLC), cryoglobulins, C3, and C4 (Figure 2).

### Spinal epidural abscess – experience with 46 patients and evaluation of prognostic factors [^111QKL2i]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Spinal epidural abscess is a rare infectious disorder, often with a delayed diagnosis, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. We conducted a retrospective study to define its clinical characteristics and to evaluate its prognostic factors.

Methods

The medical charts of 46 patients (36 men and 10 women) with spinal epidural abscess over a 10-year period (from July 1991 to May 2000) were reviewed and analyzed.

Results

A high proportion of patients had underlying diseases of diabetes (46%), frequent venous puncture (35%), spinal trauma (24%), and history of spinal surgery (22%). The initial accurate diagnostic rate was 11%. Localized spinal pain (89%), paralysis (80%), fever/chills (67%), and radicular pain (57%) were the common manifestations. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated uniformly (mean, 86.6 mm/h) when measured. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of spinal epidural abscess isolated from blood (39%) and pus (50%). Low platelet counts (< 100 × 10⁹/L) (odds ratio (OR): 8.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0–77.8), extremely high ESR (≥ 110 mm/h) (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 0.9–25.4), and cervical spine epidural abscess (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 0.8–32.0) predicted a poor outcome.

Conclusions

Localized back pain in a febrile patient with significant risk for epidural abscess warrants an immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination. The presence of thrombocytopenia, extremely elevated ESR, or evidence of spinal cord compression should prompt aggressive treatment.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — when to suspect: Clinicians should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and fever (strong, low), should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and elevated ESR or CRP (strong, low), and should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and bloodstream infection or infective endocarditis (strong, low); clinicians may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with fever and new neurologic symptoms with or without back pain (weak, low) and may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with new localized neck or back pain, following an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (weak, low). Supporting evidence notes diagnostic delay with an average time to diagnosis of 2–4 months and initial misdiagnosis in 34% of 101 patients; fever is only present in up to 45% of patients with bacterial NVO; in a series of 253 patients with bacterial NVO, 43% had epidural or paravertebral extension; an elevated ESR or CRP result in patients with back pain has a sensitivity that can range from 94% to 100%; and up to 40% of patients with NVO have a normal white blood cell count.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: from aetiopathogenesis to therapeutic approaches [^112EaWKQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent history of gastrointestinal or urinary infection, gut inflammation confirmed by elevated fecal calprotectin levels, sacroiliitis with inflammatory spinal changes and enthesitis detected by MRI support diagnosis of ERA. Subclinical gut inflammation has also been identified in older-onset of psoriatic JIA.

The diagnosis of sJIA in accordance with ILAR criteria requires arthritis and fever within the last 2 weeks, and one of the following criteria: rash, generalised lymphadenopathy, enlargement of liver or spleen, or serositis. Common laboratory abnormalities suggestive of systemic inflammation include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, platelet count, ferritin, transaminases, aldolase and d-dimers help to define the activity of the disease. Laboratorial analysis of patients with active sJIA may reveal granulocytosis, thrombocytosis, anaemia, upregulation of acute phase reactants (elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which are typical findings but not so essential for diagnosis in comparison with the life-threatening complication of MAS that include pancytopaenia, increased levels of ferritin, liver enzymes (aspartate and alanine transaminases), triglycerides, d-Dimers and hypofibrinogenemia. Clinical findings of MAS include high non-remitting fever, generalised lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, central nervous system dysfunction and hemorrhagic manifestations.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of drug-induced erythrocytosis: a systematic review [^113YdgKi]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this review. Our review was limited to peer-reviewed literature; as such, it is inherently limited by publication bias, and we cannot exclude the possibility of relevant studies in other databases that were not searched. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including the types, formulations, and doses of medications as well as in the study quality and designs, with most of the studies being retrospective in nature. As such, the rates of thromboembolism are difficult to interpret, particularly given the lack of reporting for baseline risk of thromboembolism in these studies. Furthermore, several of the findings discussed in this review were demonstrated in relatively small patient populations and may not be generalizable. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of drug-induced erythrocytosis and identify multiple classes of medications that may be implicated in erythrocytosis. Further studies would be helpful to establish a clinical approach to drug-induced erythrocytosis and to clarify clinical outcomes in this condition.

Suggestions for clinical practice

Due to the heterogeneity of these patient populations and of the included studies, there is limited evidence to guide clinical practice for drug-induced erythrocytosis. Based on this systematic review of existing literature, we suggest the following.

General recommendations

All patients starting the medications covered in this review should be counseled on the risks of developing erythrocytosis and associated thrombosis risk, while acknowledging that high-quality evidence for the latter is lacking for most medications. We suggest that physicians monitor patients for drug-induced erythrocytosis with a CBC after initiating treatment, with the frequency of ongoing monitoring depending on the type of medication and its indication. The role of phlebotomy or aspirin is uncertain, and these interventions may not be sufficient to mitigate thrombosis risk. Practitioners should discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment and engage in shared decision-making. If relevant, enrollment in a clinical trial or prospective registry should be considered.

The former minor criterion "echocardiogram consistent with IE but not meeting major criterion" was re-evaluated, and in a database with " > 800 cases" it "was used in only 5% of cases… Therefore, this minor criterion was eliminated in the modified Duke criteria".

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

This is the case of a previously healthy, 11-year-old male of Indian descent who presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and 7-lb weight loss. Acutely, he developed 5 days of fever as high as 39.4°C. He had a remote travel history to the Middle East. On physical examination, he was febrile and tachycardic, was thin but otherwise had a normal examination. His inflammatory markers were elevated: erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 93 mm/hour and his C-reactive protein was 25.4 mg/L. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 17,000 × 10³/µL with increased bands. His hemoglobin level was 8.8 g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume of 81 fl. Platelets were 556 × 10³/µL. A chest radiograph was concerning for a cavitary lung lesion and an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in his spleen. Our panel of experts reviews his case and examines the workup of this patient with diverse symptoms and focal findings on chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^1146czSR]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

### Myeloproliferative disorders [^117MFmef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The emergency providers generally encounters myeloproliferative disorders (MPNs) in 1 of 2 ways: as striking laboratory abnormalities of seeming unknown consequence, or in previously diagnosed patients presenting with complications. The course of patients with MPNs is highly variable, but major complications can arise. Emergent conditions related to hyperviscosity need to be recognized early and treated aggressively. Rapid hydration, transfusion, cytoreduction, and early hematology consultation can be lifesaving. Likewise, although management is not altered, a high index of suspicion for thrombotic complications is required in patients with known MPNs as these are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — interpretive value and limitations: The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is usually, but not always, elevated in children with ABA at presentation and is usually higher in ABA than in transient nonbacterial synovitis or acute rheumatic fever, but overlap of ESR ranges precludes discriminatory utility, and the ESR often does not normalize until the fourth week after initiation of therapy; therefore, the Guideline Panel does not see value in the routine inclusion of ESR testing in children evaluated for suspected ABA to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of joint inflammation, the ESR does not substantially assist in pathogen assessment, and it has not been helpful for assessing adjacent musculoskeletal infection to determine need for extended antimicrobial therapy.

Diagnostic procedures — laboratory tests in the diabetic foot — Consideration should be given to the following tests, but many lack the ability to impart a definitive diagnosis, necessitating clinical correlation. Clinical laboratory tests that may be needed include fasting or random blood glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), complete blood count (CBC) with or without differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistries, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, wound and blood cultures, and urinalysis. Caution must be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests because several reports have documented the absence of leukocytosis in the presence of severe foot infections, and a common sign of persistent infection is recalcitrant hyperglycemia despite usual antihyperglycemic regimens.

Available diagnostic methods for PBI

Clinical assessment, symptoms, and signs of peripheral bone infection

In acute cases, individuals may report a generalized feeling of illness, loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea, and fever. Pain is the most common local symptom, and there may be a reduced ability to use the affected body part. A history of recent trauma, surgery, or infection of another organ (i.e. lungs, bladder) can be present. Individuals with chronic osteomyelitis may have a history of an acute episode. The patient may have an underlying immune system disease or peripheral vascular disease. The patient must be questioned about intravenous drug abuse and alcoholism. A complete medical history should be obtained, including all current and prior illnesses and injuries. On physical examination, there can be clear signs of disease, like a direct fistula to the bone and purulent discharge, but often signs are more subtle like slight erythema and swelling or sub-febrile temperature and diffuse pain. Fever, signs of dehydration or other signs of blood infection (sepsis) may be evident. Range of motion of joints may be reduced. In analogy with ulcers in patients with a diabetic foot pointing to osteomyelitis, ulcers in the tibia often reflect osteomyelitis. Therefore a probe-to-bone test can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of PBI. In this test, the physician palpates the bone with a metal probe. This simple bedside procedure is based on the concept that if the probe can reach bone, so can infectious bacteria [Lavery 2007].

Value of laboratory parameters

The specificity of elevated laboratory parameters of inflammation (white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin) in differentiating PBI from other clinical conditions is low. In adult patients with PBI, ESR and CRP may be elevated, but on the contrary white blood cell counts is often in the normal range. Therefore, these parameters are not able to sufficiently discriminate the presence or absence of infection. However, a sharp increase of ESR and CRP may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PBI in the clinical context of a high level of suspicion and may therefore influence the choice of imaging modality to be performed first. Also, serum procalcitonin may be used as a diagnostic marker for PBI. Blood cultures should be performed for both aerobic and anaerobic germs in febrile patients in addition to biopsy, when possible.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^112HTVP5]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

### Evidence-based diagnostics: adult septic arthritis [^111Zyui6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acutely swollen or painful joints are common complaints in the emergency department (ED). Septic arthritis in adults is a challenging diagnosis, but prompt differentiation of a bacterial etiology is crucial to minimize morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

The objective was to perform a systematic review describing the diagnostic characteristics of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for nongonococcal septic arthritis. A secondary objective was to quantify test and treatment thresholds using derived estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as well as best-evidence diagnostic and treatment risks and anticipated benefits from appropriate therapy.

Methods

Two electronic search engines (PUBMED and EMBASE) were used in conjunction with a selected bibliography and scientific abstract hand search. Inclusion criteria included adult trials of patients presenting with monoarticular complaints if they reported sufficient detail to reconstruct partial or complete 2 × 2 contingency tables for experimental diagnostic test characteristics using an acceptable criterion standard. Evidence was rated by two investigators using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS). When more than one similarly designed trial existed for a diagnostic test, meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Interval likelihood ratios (LRs) were computed when possible. To illustrate one method to quantify theoretical points in the probability of disease whereby clinicians might cease testing altogether and either withhold treatment (test threshold) or initiate definitive therapy in lieu of further diagnostics (treatment threshold), an interactive spreadsheet was designed and sample calculations were provided based on research estimates of diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic risk, and therapeutic risk/benefits.

Results

The prevalence of nongonococcal septic arthritis in ED patients with a single acutely painful joint is approximately 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17% to 38%). With the exception of joint surgery (positive likelihood ratio [+LR] = 6.9) or skin infection overlying a prosthetic joint (+LR = 15.0), history, physical examination, and serum tests do not significantly alter posttest probability. Serum inflammatory markers such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are not useful acutely. The interval LR for synovial white blood cell (sWBC) counts of 0 × 10⁹–25 × 10⁹/L was 0.33; for 25 × 10⁹–50 × 10⁹/L, 1.06; for 50 × 10⁹–100 × 10⁹/L, 3.59; and exceeding 100 × 10⁹/L, infinity. Synovial lactate may be useful to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of septic arthritis with a +LR ranging from 2.4 to infinity, and negative likelihood ratio (-LR) ranging from 0 to 0.46. Rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of synovial fluid may identify the causative organism within 3 hours. Based on 56% sensitivity and 90% specificity for sWBC counts of > 50 × 10(9)/L in conjunction with best-evidence estimates for diagnosis-related risk and treatment-related risk/benefit, the arthrocentesis test threshold is 5%, with a treatment threshold of 39%.

Conclusions

Recent joint surgery or cellulitis overlying a prosthetic hip or knee were the only findings on history or physical examination that significantly alter the probability of nongonococcal septic arthritis. Extreme values of sWBC (> 50 × 10⁹/L) can increase, but not decrease, the probability of septic arthritis. Future ED-based diagnostic trials are needed to evaluate the role of clinical gestalt and the efficacy of nontraditional synovial markers such as lactate.

This study examined fecal samples from 22 patients with active CD, 10 patients with inactive CD, and 32 healthy controls. Baseline data, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and clinical features of CD patients (such as general clinical data, Montreal classification, CDAI, and surgical history), were obtained from medical records and direct interviews. Compared with healthy controls, CD patients tended to be younger and have a lower BMI at diagnosis, while the sex distribution did not significantly differ between CD patients and healthy controls. Many CD patients display elevated high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), indicating ongoing intestinal inflammation. Moreover, these patients commonly exhibit reduced levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), and the albumin/globulin ratio (A/G), suggesting compromised intestinal nutrient absorption. The detailed general and clinical characteristics of the included CD patients and healthy controls are presented in Table 2. The background of each patient with remission and active CD is shown in Table S1. The specific clinical characteristics of CD patients. I patients and CD.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^111h7pTh]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) monitoring in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) are characterized by postoperative CRP rises "on the order of 3 to 15 mg/dL (30 to 150 mg/L)" peaking "on the second to third postoperative day", while "The ESR peaks similarly to CRP but normalizes more slowly" and, in uncomplicated cases, "usually occurs within 3 to 4 weeks". Within these limits, "the panel suggests sequential monitoring of CRP as an adjunctive measure" and notes "There are no data to support a particular frequency of CRP monitoring", but "Measurement every 2 to 3 days during the early therapeutic course, rather than daily, followed by weekly or other periodic measurement until normalization (or a clear trend toward normal is evident) is an acceptable approach". The guideline cautions that "The interpretation of persistent elevation of the CRP in the face of apparent clinical improvement is uncertain" and that "no specific thresholds of CRP concentration have been well validated for specific clinical interventions or decisions regarding the duration of therapy".

3. CRP and ESR should always be performed in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A normal value does not rule out PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients presenting with clinical signs of prosthetic joint infection (i.e. fever, unexplained pain at the site of arthroplasty, prosthetic loosening, or a sinus tract) should be subjected to screening for inflammatory markers in serum. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are good preliminary tests. Screening of these markers can be performed rapidly, inexpensively, and with minimal inconvenience. Although there is considerable variation in sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for both CRP (SE 21–100%, SP 20–96%) and ESR (SE 58–97%, SP 33–90.9%), in general they show good diagnostic value, and are of relevance particularly for therapy follow-up. A threshold of 10 mg/l for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR of is recommended for diagnostic purposes. One level 1 study and 32 level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and ESR in serum. However, when testing for CRP and ESR, one should keep in mind that both markers can be influenced by numerous factors (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, age, and technical details). Furthermore, CRP is produced in the liver, and especially in low-grade chronic PJI, levels may not be elevated. Therefore, a careful history and physical examination are mandatory. Several studies suggest using the combination of ESR and CRP. In any case, if one of these markers is above the threshold, further diagnostic tests should be performed. Low CRP and ESR do not rule out PJI.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with atherothrombotic risk factors presenting with low concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein [^115TQAwK]. Atherosclerosis (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To clarify whether individuals with low concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are free of atherothrombotic risk factors or low-grade inflammation.

Methods and Results

This cross-sectional study included 1266 individuals with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity). Eighty percent of women and the same percentage of men with a low concentration (0.8 ± 0.4 mg/l) of hs-CRP had at least one atherothrombotic risk factor. About one-fourth of the females and a one-third of the males with a low concentration of hs-CRP had at least one laboratory marker of chronic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBCC) or fibrinogen concentration) in the upper 75th percentile.

Conclusion

Individuals presenting with low concentrations of hs-CRP are not necessarily free of atherothrombotic risk factors. One-fourth of the females and a third of the males in this group presented laboratory evidence of a low-grade inflammation as detected by increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count or fibrinogen concentration.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^1176f9RM]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory biomarkers in diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) — erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and procalcitonin (PCT) have limited stand‑alone diagnostic performance: a highly elevated ESR (≥ 70 mm/h) shows sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis of 81%, 80%, and 0.84, respectively; available studies found little correlation of WBC with infection severity; CRP levels rise and fall more quickly with infection and resolution, and studies report PCT levels are higher in infected diabetic foot ulcers but with little correlation to severity; because their specificity and sensitivity do not exceed 0.85 when used alone, inflammatory biomarkers should be used when uncertainty persists after clinical assessment, and a Best Practice Statement about the use of ESR, CRP, or PCT is made with low‑certainty evidence.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^111qT6NT]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10⁹/L, and platelet count 582 × 10⁹/L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10⁹/L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Stroke risk and risk factors in patients with central retinal artery occlusion [^115NK9XH]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is mechanistically similar to a stroke. Current guidelines recommend a standardized and systematic evaluation of risk factors for patients who have had a stroke. This study evaluates the yield of this evaluation in patients with CRAO and frequency of stroke in this population.

Design

Cohort study.

Methods

We evaluated the diagnostic yield of an expedited inpatient evaluation of cerebrovascular risk factors in a cohort of patients presenting with an acute CRAO within the period from 2009 to 2017 at an academic hospital. Vital signs and laboratory parameters, including low-density lipoprotein level, hemoglobin A1c fraction, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, platelet count, and troponin level, were collected. Echocardiography, cardiac telemetry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrovascular imaging were obtained to screen for strokes and vascular risk factors. All new diagnoses and clinical treatments stemming from the inpatient evaluation were documented. Outcomes included the frequency of stroke on MRI, hypertensive emergency, critical carotid disease, or critical cardiac disease, including high-grade valvular lesions, new myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias. We documented the frequency of a change in medication, acute surgical intervention, or new diagnosis of systemic disease as a result of the inpatient evaluation. Finally, we evaluated the rate of symptomatic stroke, myocardial infarct, and death risk in the 24 months after CRAO.

Results

In this cohort of 103 patients with CRAO and systematic risk factor screening, 36.7% of patients had critical carotid disease, 37.3% had coincident acute stroke, 33.0% presented with hypertensive emergency, 20.0% had a myocardial infarction or critical structural cardiac disease, 25% underwent an urgent surgical intervention, and 93% had a change in medication as a result of the inpatient evaluation. Patients with CRAO had similar risk of subsequent stroke, myocardial infarction, and death as patients with high-risk transient ischemic attack.

Conclusions

Patients with CRAO are at significant risk of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and often have undiagnosed risk factors that may be modifiable.

### Whipple's disease: the great masquerader-a high level of suspicion is the key to diagnosis [^114HL3iX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient 1

The patient was a 37-year-old Caucasian male, sporadic smoker, with moderate alcohol consumption, worked as a truck driver. Rheumatic symptoms had started 3 years before admission to hospital, with a transient swelling of one ring finger followed by intermittent episodes of fever with symmetrical and migratory pain, stiffness and in periods, swelling of several other joints. He was treated with non-steroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy due to palindromic rheumatism (PR) without improvement. The diagnosis was changed to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and he was treated with methotrexate plus hydroxychloroquine. The joint stiffness continued while the swelling subsided.

Nine months later, he experienced gastrointestinal symptoms; flatulence, non-bloody diarrhea, sporadic vomiting, intermittent fever and slight weight loss. The body mass index (BMI) was 18.4 kg/m 2 (initial 19.7 kg/m 2). Diarrhea gradually worsened with looser stool consistency, more frequent bowel emptying and abdominal pain. Anemia was detected with hemoglobin (Hb) of 120 g/L (normal range 134–170 g/L), hypoalbuminemia of 21 g/L (normal range 35–45 g/L). Stools were positive for hemoglobin and with an elevated level of calprotectin, 244 mg/kg (normal range 0–50 mg/kg). Anti-transglutaminase antibodies were negative. The symptoms aggravated with water-thin diarrhea up to 30 times a day, the onset of fatigue, and B-symptoms such as night sweats and fever peaks up to 40 degrees Celsius. A rectoscopy one month later was without pathological findings. By then, he had lost another 5 kg in weight (BMI 17 kg/m 2) and was hospitalized. He underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan that showed signs of small bowel inflammation, why inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — primarily Crohn's disease — was suspected. He was given methotrexate 20 mg once a week and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg every morning. Laboratory examinations showed leukocytes 9.2 × 10 9 /L, Hb 116 g/L, reticulocytes 24.6 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 397 × 10⁹/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 19 mg/L, albumin 22 g/L and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) 16 mm/h. Fecal cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter were negative as was cytotoxin testing for Clostridium difficile. A second CT scan showed pathologically enlarged lymph nodes extending paraaortically from upper abdomen down into the small pelvis and also ventrally in the mesentery. The working diagnosis was changed from IBD to malignant lymphoma and he was discharged from hospital and referred to oncological care. His condition deteriorated with significant fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and continued water-thin diarrhea 15–20 times per day with blood. He lost another 5 kg by weight (BMI 15.9 kg/m 2).

### Limited value of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate as an indicator of malignancy [^117PxHFd]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often suspected of having malignant disease and are subjected to extensive investigations. Thus, the finding of an elevated ESR can result in considerable costs and might even be dangerous for the patient if invasive studies are ordered.

Objectives

Our aims were to establish (i) the prevalence of malignant diseases in hospitalized patients and out-patients with elevated ESR; and (ii) the long-term incidence of malignant diseases in patients during 5 years after unsuccessful investigation for elevated ESR.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 128 patients admitted to the Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Kiel and in 94 out-patients under the care of a GP. A retrospective cohort study of 50 patients was also carried out by contacting GPs of patients discharged from hospital after unsuccessful investigation.

Results

In the hospitalized patients, the ESR was elevated in 53.1% (68/128) and was normal in 46.9% (60/128). Malignancy was found in 25.0% (17/68) of patients with elevated ESR and in 15% (9/60) of patients with normal ESR (P = 0.16). Of the out-patients, 94 patients with elevated ESR were investigated, of whom 8.5% (8/94) had malignancies (P = 0.004 compared with hospitalized patients). In the follow-up study of 50 patients who had been discharged with the diagnosis "elevated ESR of unknown origin", follow-up information was available from 38 individuals. Of these, 71.0% (27/38) had not developed signs or symptoms of any disease at the time of investigation. Malignant disease had developed in only 5.3% (2/38).

Conclusion

The prevalence of malignancy in patients with elevated ESR is low, in both the clinical and the general practice setting. Elevation of ESR is not an early sign of malignant disease and does not justify extensive investigation in a patient who has no symptoms which are suggestive of a tumour.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) clinical care — clinical presentation describes that EVALI typically presents as an acute or subacute respiratory illness with nonspecific symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and/or hemoptysis. Most patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea and/or constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and/or weight loss. Symptoms develop over days to weeks, and laboratory findings are nonspecific and may include elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

### What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes-related foot infections? [^1167ktyN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection of the foot is important because osteomyelitis is associated with more operations, amputation, and prolonged antibiotic exposure. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are routinely ordered inflammatory biomarkers for evaluating foot infection. When initial evaluation is inconclusive, advanced imaging is indicated, and high clinical or radiographic suspicion of osteomyelitis may indicate bone biopsy to identify organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. Although ESR and CRP levels are helpful for distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infections in patients with diabetes-related foot infections, parameters regarding optimal cutoff values for those tests have not, to our knowledge, been defined.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to differentiate osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with diabetes-related foot infection? (2) Can a diagnostic algorithm be derived to guide interpretation of ESR and CRP to improve recognition of osteomyelitis in the setting of diabetic foot infection?

Methods

The medical records of 1842 patients between 18 and 89 years of age treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and February 6, 2017 for foot infection were reviewed. For inclusion, patients must have had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe infection, ESR and CRP values within 72 hours of admission, either advanced imaging (MRI or single-positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) or bone biopsy during admission and must not have had comorbidities that could affect ESR and CRP, such as autoimmune disorders. As such, 1489 patients were excluded, and 353 patients were included in the study. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive bone culture or histopathology. Osteomyelitis was considered to be absent if there was a negative MRI or SPECT/CT result, or negative bone culture and histology findings if imaging was inconclusive. We identified 176 patients with osteomyelitis and 177 with soft-tissue infection. A blinded investigator performed the statistics. Optimal cutoffs of ESR and CRP were determined using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was determined using epidemiologic principles of screening evaluations.

Results

An ESR of 60 mm/h and a CRP level of 7.9 mg/dL were determined to be the optimal cutoff points for predicting osteomyelitis based on results of the ROC analysis. The ESR threshold of 60 mm/h demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% (95% confidence interval, 67–80) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 48–63) for osteomyelitis, whereas the CRP threshold of 7.9 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI, 41–57) and specificity of 80% (95% CI, 74–86). If the ESR is < 30 mm/h, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is low. However, if ESR is > 60 mm/h and CRP level is > 7.9 mg/dL, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is high, and treatment of suspected osteomyelitis should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

While ESR is better for ruling out osteomyelitis initially, CRP helps distinguish osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with high ESR values. Further prospective studies addressing the prognostic value of ESR and CRP are needed, and a more comprehensive diagnostic algorithm should be developed to include other diagnostic tests such as probe-to-bone and imaging.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, diagnostic study.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115mBWHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### The bloody mess of red blood cell transfusion [^111wHv3v]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In view of the published literature, anaemia is common in the general population and relevant for patient outcome. In the hospital, acute anaemia is often treated by RBC transfusions, because it has been proven to increase Hb levels in a timely manner. This therapeutic approach, however, usually does not address the underlying disease that triggered anaemia and may carry its own risks that have to be taken into account.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111MCERg]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

### A rational approach to JAK2 mutation testing in patients with elevated hemoglobin: results from the JAK2 prediction cohort (JAKPOT) study [^117DmHwm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrocytosis, most often measured as an increase in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, is a common reason for referral to internal medicine and hematology clinics and a rational approach is required to effectively identify patients with polycythemia vera while avoiding over-investigation.

Aim

We aimed to develop and validate a simple rule to predict JAK2 mutation positivity based on complete blood count parameters to aid in the diagnostic approach to patients referred for elevated hemoglobin.

Setting

Internal medicine and hematology clinics at an academic tertiary referral center.

Participants

The JAK2 Prediction Cohort (JAKPOT), a large retrospective cohort (n = 901) of patients evaluated by internal medicine and hematology specialists for elevated hemoglobin.

Design

JAK2 mutation analysis was performed in all patients and clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Patients were randomly divided into derivation and validation cohorts. A prediction rule was developed using data from the derivation cohort and tested in the validation cohort.

Key Results

The JAKPOT prediction rule included three variables: (i) red blood cell count > 6.45×10¹²/L, (ii) platelets > 350×10⁹/L, and (iii) neutrophils > 6.2×10⁹/L; absence of all criteria was effective at ruling out JAK2-positivity with sensitivities 94.7% and 100%, and negative predictive values of 98.8% and 100% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, with an overall low false negative rate of 0.4%. The rule was validated for three different methods of JAK2 testing. Applying this rule to our entire cohort would have resulted in over 50% fewer tests.

Conclusion

In patients with elevated hemoglobin, the use of a simple prediction rule helps to accurately identify patients with a low likelihood of having a JAK2 mutation, potentially limiting costly over-investigation in this common referral population.

### Analysis of platelet count and new cancer diagnosis over a 10-year period [^116yS7mA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with cancer often have an abnormally high platelet count at the time of diagnosis (thrombocytosis), defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L (to convert to ×10³ per microliter, divide by 1.0). A normal platelet count falls between 150 and 450 × 10⁹/L and varies with the age and sex of the individual. Several conditions that commonly cause an elevated platelet count include acute blood loss, infection, and inflammation. Solid tumor cancers can sometimes lead to an elevated platelet count to the extent that an undiagnosed cancer is often considered in the diagnostic workup of a patient with thrombocytosis. Cancer is believed to induce platelet formation through the release of interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates the production of thrombopoietin hormone. Elevated levels of thrombopoietin have a direct effect on increased platelet production. Excess levels of thrombopoietin in the blood stimulate megakaryocyte cell division in the bone marrow, which in turn leads to platelet formation.

An elevated platelet count has been shown to be associated with short-term risk of cancer in the general population. Prospective studies evaluating platelet count and survival among patients with newly diagnosed cancer have also noted a high proportion of patients who presented with thrombocytosis. The excess risk associated with an elevated platelet count varies by cancer site but has been most studied for lung, colon, and gastric cancers. The full range of cancers associated with a high platelet count and whether risks associated with platelet counts within the high-normal range exist remain unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between a high platelet count and cancer is transient or prolonged. Based on results of previous studies, a high platelet count may be a risk factor for developing cancer or, alternatively, a marker indicative of an undetected cancer. It is also not clear whether an increasing platelet count is a better indicator of a new cancer than is a high but steady platelet count.

We identified a cohort of adult residents in Ontario, Canada, who had 1 or more routine blood tests performed for a complete blood count (CBC) including platelet counts and subsequently received a diagnosis of cancer to assess the range of cancers associated with a high platelet count. We also examined whether an increasing platelet count is associated with an increased cancer risk.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) response monitoring — In children with presumed or confirmed ABA receiving antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical intervention, in addition to serial clinical evaluation, we suggest performing C-reactive protein (CRP) at initial evaluation followed by sequential monitoring of CRP to assess response to therapy, rather than relying solely on clinical evaluation (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence); Serial clinical examination that assess the febrile response, pain and musculoskeletal function remain the primary means of monitoring response to treatment. Gradual clinical improvement including resolution of fever over 2 to 4 days is generally expected; CRP typically has a peak on day 2–3 in uncomplicated infection and returns to the normal range in about 9 to 12 days. The consensus of the Guideline Panel is that CRP may be evaluated every 2 or 3 days until the concentration begins to drop consistently, and once the CRP concentration has decreased substantially in the context of ongoing clinical improvement, further measurement is not necessary. A declining CRP concentration can be used to provide information supplementary to the clinical course for determining when a child may be transitioned to oral antimicrobial therapy and/or discharged home, and successful transition to oral therapy after good clinical response plus CRP decline by 50% or more has been described. If serial CRPs fail to trend downward or resume an upward trend, particularly with recurrent symptoms, children should be carefully evaluated for persistent ABA or adjacent osteomyelitis and may require advanced imaging such as MRI. The role of other inflammatory markers, such as serum procalcitonin (PCT), has not been established; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has limited utility and in one study took a mean of 18 days to normalize; normalization or substantial decline in the blood white blood cell (WBC) count over the first few days is consistent with response but has not been prospectively evaluated adequately as a biomarker of recovery.

COVID-19 in children

Regarding the pediatric age, it is now known that COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy only about 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age. Numbers collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that children age 1–10 years old represent only 0.9% of COVID-19 cases while children and adolescents age 10–19 years old were 1.2% of the 44,672 confirmed positive subjects.

Dong et al. studied the epidemiologic characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed infection identified from January 16th to February 8th 2020 in China. The authors described an asymptomatic, mild, or moderate course in 94.1% of cases, with 4.4% of patients totally asymptomatic. They considered asymptomatic those children with positive laboratory tests without any clinical signs or symptoms or radiological chest findings, mild those with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection in the absence of auscultatory abnormalities or children with only digestive symptoms, and moderate those with pneumonia, but no obvious hypoxemia. The spectrum of manifestations observed in the pediatric age includes fever (frequently low grade), cough, pharyngeal erythema, tachycardia, and tachypnea, less usually rhinorrhea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. Children may show a coinfection with other viral pneumonia, and in a series of 20 Chinese children eight showed a concomitant infection with influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or cytomegalovirus. The majority of pediatric patients have a normal blood count, with 15% showing leukocytosis and 15% leukopenia. CRP and ESR are also frequently in normal range. Hence, while in adults lymphocyte and platelet counts, CRP, and albumin levels have been proposed as signs for severe infection, in children the potential prognostic value of these indicators is not clear. Chest CT findings are documented in almost half of children, and appear to be similar, but milder when compared to those found in adults. Plain chest X-rays may fail to detect the lesions or may be unable the detail pathologic features.

Finally, the experience on neonates and mother-child transplacental transmission is very limited. Pregnant women can have the typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia present in non-pregnant women, but outcomes in their neonates seem to be favorable. Data obtained from a small group of women with COVID-19 pneumonia in their third trimester of pregnancy do not support an intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.

### C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate results reliably exclude invasive bacterial infections [^111cgrx8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians utilize inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), to identify febrile children who may have an occult serious illness or infection.

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the relationship between invasive bacterial infections (IBIs) and CRP and ESR in febrile children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1460 febrile children < 21 years of age, who presented to a single Emergency Department (ED) between 2012 and 2014 for evaluation of fever of < 14 days' duration, who had both CRP and ESR obtained. Our primary outcome was IBI, defined as growth of pathogenic bacteria from a culture of cerebrospinal fluid or blood. We reviewed all ED encounters that occurred within three days of the index visits for development of IBI. We examined the negative predictive value (NPV) of CRP and ESR for IBI.

Results

Of the 1460 eligible ED encounters, the median patient age was 5.3 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.4–10.0 years] and 762 (50.4%) were hospitalized. The median duration of fever was 4 days (IQR 1–7 days). Overall, 20 had an IBI (20/1460; 1.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9–2.1%). None of those with a normal CRP (NPV 273/273; 100%, 95% CI 98.6–100%) or a normal ESR (NPV 486/486; 100%, 95% CI 99.2–100%) had an IBI.

Conclusions

In our cross-sectional study of febrile children, IBI was unlikely with either a normal CRP or ESR. Inflammatory markers could be used to assist clinical decision-making while awaiting results of bacterial cultures.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic role and limitations in pediatric ABA: Blood markers of systemic inflammation, such as CRP, can aid in distinguishing ABA (particularly caused by S. aureus) from transient nonbacterial synovitis, though the serum CRP is usually, but not always, elevated at presentation. CRP alone, or when used with clinical history and examination, has insufficient specificity or sensitivity to confirm or rule-out ABA; however, obtaining a CRP at presentation is useful because, if elevated, it can be used to monitor appropriate response to management. A systematic review identified three prospective cohort studies and one retrospective case-control study assessing CRP diagnostic test accuracy in children with symptoms suspicious for musculoskeletal infections (2005 to 2022), which suggested very limited value for CRP as a confirmatory diagnostic test, with numeric cut-off levels varying and none establishing a definitive CRP value above which ABA should be suspected or below which it could be excluded. A recent prospective study reported an a posteriori optimal cut-off of 23.8 mg/L (2.38 md/dL) that has not been validated; another prospective cohort evaluated two CRP cut-offs, 100 and 500 mg/L (10 and 50 mg/dL); a third required abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or CRP (> 10 mm/hr and > 100 mg/L respectively), and no evaluation of the children without elevated markers was reported.

### Polycythemia vera [^114e6gBM]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^112XVsQL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Early infection is often easy to recognize by acute pain in the wound area, redness, swelling, wound leakage, heat, and fever. Late infection is often caused by haematogenous spread, with symptoms from both the affected joint and the primary infection site. The main diagnostic problem is the delayed, often low-grade infection with mostly nonspecific symptoms. In all PJIs, a delay in starting an appropriate antibiotic regimen and surgical treatment has an important impact on the chance of saving the prosthesis and joint function. Therefore, early diagnosis is of utmost importance.

There is no single routine test available that can diagnose PJI with sufficient accuracy. Cultures, biopsies, serum inflammatory markers, and imaging techniques all have their pros and cons. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and leukocyte count are not sensitive or specific enough to detect or exclude a PJI. Joint aspiration itself involves a risk of infection, and its sensitivity is highly variable. In general, a combination of clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and imaging tests are performed based on personal experience, techniques available in the institute, and cost aspects. Indeed, most signs and symptoms that might indicate the presence of a PJI may be simply related to an aseptic loosening of the prosthesis or to a soft tissue infection. Since loosening, soft tissue infection without osteomyelitis, and PJI require different treatment strategies (NSAIDs, antibiotic therapy, or surgery for explant and re-implant), the correct differential diagnosis among these clinical situations is crucial.

The development of biofilms plays a strategic role in the pathogenesis of PJI. Microorganisms adhere to the implant and form a biofilm, within which they are protected from the host immune system and most antibiotics. The most frequent etiologic agents are staphylococci, accounting for more than 50% of PJIs. Staphylococcus aureus is most commonly isolated in early infection, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci are more frequent in late infection.

Other commonly isolated organisms in late infections are streptococci (9–10%), enterococci (3–7%), and anaerobes (2–4%). Gram-negative bacteria, mostly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. and Proteus spp. even if relatively uncommon agents, have an important clinical impact because of the difficulty in treating them. Overall, about 20% of PJIs are polymicrobial and 7–11% are culture-negative. Unusual pathogens such as Candida spp. Brucella spp. and mycobacteria have also been reported.

### Agreement between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in hospital practice [^114Zimnf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are frequently prescribed jointly. The usefulness of this practice is uncertain.

Methods

All patients with ESR and CRP measured at the same time in an academic tertiary hospital during a 1-year period were included. Concomitant measures of serum creatinine, hematocrit, and anti-Xa activity were recorded to study noninflammatory cause of increased ESR. Level of agreement between ESR and CRP was assessed with kappa coefficient, and their accuracy was determined in a medical chart review of 99 randomly selected patients with disagreement between both markers.

Results

Among 5777 patients, 35% and 58% had an elevated CRP and ESR, respectively. ESR and CRP were in agreement in 67% of patients (both elevated in 30%, both normal in 37%). A disagreement was observed in 33% (elevated ESR/normal CRP in 28%, normal ESR/elevated CRP in 5%). The kappa coefficient showed poor agreement (k = 0.38) between both markers. Review of medical chart showed that 25 patients with elevated CRP and normal ESR had an active inflammatory disease (false-negative ESR). Conversely, 74 patients had elevated ESR and normal CRP-32% had resolving inflammatory disorders, 28% disclosed a variable interfering with the ESR measure (false-positive ESR), 32% had unexplained discrepancies, and 8% had an active inflammatory disease (false-negative CRP).

Conclusion

In hospital practice, joint measurement of ESR and CRP is unwarranted. Because of slow variation and frequent confounding, ESR is frequently misleading in unselected patients. When an inflammatory disorder is suspected, priority should be given to CRP.

An 8-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to his pediatrician with 5 days of fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and pallor. The pediatrician referred the patient to the emergency department (ED), out of concern for possible malignancy. Initial vital signs indicated fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and abdominal tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial laboratory studies were notable for pancytopenia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed massive splenomegaly. The only significant history of travel was immigration from Albania 10 months before admission. The patient was admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital and was evaluated by hematology-oncology, infectious disease, genetics, and rheumatology subspecialty teams. Our multidisciplinary panel of experts will discuss the evaluation of pancytopenia with apparent multiorgan involvement and the diagnosis and appropriate management of a rare disease.

### Diagnosing fracture-related infection: current concepts and recommendations [^113J8YNH]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Serum Inflammatory Markers

The most commonly used serum inflammation markers in orthopaedic surgery are leukocyte count (LC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

Leukocytes, and more specifically neutrophils, are the first innate immune cells that are rapidly recruited from the bloodstream to sites of infection and act as major phagocytes. The number of leucocytes and neutrophils can be measured in the blood, and therefore, they are frequently used as a surveillance tool for (postoperative) infection. Although an increase above normal parameters can be an indication of infection, their number will also increase in the presence of other causes of cell damage, such as trauma, surgery, sterile inflammation, systemic inflammatory diseases, and malignancies. In spinal surgery, it is reported that maximum values of LC are seen on days 1 to 3 postoperatively and decline to normal values between days 4 and 6.

Levels of CRP are known to increase in response to various stimuli, such as infection, tissue damage, acute coronary syndrome, and allergies. The functions of CRP include recognizing microbial pathogens, activating the complement pathway, and leucocyte phagocytosis. In fracture patients, CRP levels increase to a maximum on the second day and then return to normal after 2 weeks.

Other acute phase proteins (particularly fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin) and immunoglobulins (mainly IgM) cause a decrease in the negative surface charge of erythrocytes with subsequently increased agglutination and rouleaux formation (stacks of erythrocytes). Therefore, infection results in an increase in the relative weight of erythrocytes expressed by elevated ESR. Values of ESR peak at days 7–11 postoperatively following spinal instrumentation and decrease gradually until week 6.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^116AwNWk]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Some laboratory abnormalities in patients with vasculitis significantly raise our suspicion for underlying hematologic malignancy and lead us to initiate hematology consultation or referral (Figure 2). Inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis often cause anemia, neutrophil‐dominant leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. In contrast, erythrocytosis, neutropenia, persistent monocytosis or lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and especially bicytopenia or pancytopenia are uncommon and merit further evaluation. Eosinophilia is commonly recognized by rheumatologists and has its own broad differential diagnosis, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, IgG4‐related disease, and hematologic mimics (Table 1), as has previously been described. In the absence of lymphocytosis, elevated SPEP and SFLC are more likely to reveal monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) than plasma cell dyscrasia. Both these diagnoses increase in prevalence with age and can be followed annually in clinic in the absence of clinical features of hypercalcemia, bone pain, and renal dysfunction. However, together with elevated LDH and cryoglobulin levels and hypocomplementemia, especially of C4 or consistent clinical phenotype (Table 1), these may also support consideration of MGUS‐ or lymphoid malignancy–associated cryoglobulinemia or amyloidosis (Figure 2). In patients developing vasculitis or perivascular inflammation during treatment of solid tumors, especially with neutrophilia and possibly circulating blasts on CBC, we look for antecedent granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) exposure.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

Surgical dilemma

A patient in their 40s presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of diffuse itching, epistaxis, oral ulcers, gum bleeding, petechiae and ecchymoses (figure 1). Medical history was notable for hypertension. The patient denied any recent illnesses, new medications or recent vaccinations. The patient denied any B symptoms including fevers, night sweats or weight loss. Family history was notable for a maternal cousin and uncle with thrombocytopenia requiring intervention.

Figure 1
Lower extremity petechiae and ecchymoses at time of initial presentation.

Laboratory workup was notable for white blood coun (WBC) 8.7, hemoglobin 17, platelets < 2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 275, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 33, and Coomb's direct antiglobulin test (DAT) + (anti-A IgG). Antinuclear antibody (ANA), HIV, hepatitis B and C, and COVID-19 were negative. CT abdomen/pelvis did not demonstrate any hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral smear was notable for an absence of platelets and increased neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. There was no significant dysplasia or blasts. The patient was treated for presumed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and pulse-dose intravenous steroids. The platelet count initially improved, but the response was not sustained, and the patient was transferred to our tertiary care institution for further management.

On transfer to our institution, additional hematological and rheumatological workup was pursued, which remained consistent with ITP. Platelet-reactive antibodies were detected in the patient's serum against glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Bone marrow biopsy was grossly normal, with an appropriate increase in the number of megakaryocytes without evidence of hematolymphoid malignancy.

The patient continued treatment with repeat IVIG and intravenous steroids. Romiplostim, a thrombopoetin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), was added as an additional second-line therapy. However, platelet count remained < 5 and did not respond to further platelet transfusions. The patient was classified as having severe refractory ITP, and general surgery was consulted for further recommendations.

### A review of clinical and laboratory predictors of severe COVID-19 disease [^114BdtUn]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In late December 2019, the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. It quickly spread and emerged as a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on society. As clinical research on this novel virus emerges, there is a limited amount of data that review clinical and laboratory predictors of severe disease. We present a case of a patient with severely elevated inflammatory markers who remained clinically stable during his hospital course.

Case Discussion

A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency room with 11 days of persistent fevers and new-onset anterior chest tightness. He was admitted to the hospital due to a reported oxygen desaturation at home to 87% (taken by his spouse, a healthcare professional) and ambulatory oxygen desaturation down to 87%. He was noted to have severely elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and computed tomography pulmonary angiograph findings consistent with COVID-19. He remained on room air and clinically stable throughout his 3-day hospital course. While his C-reactive protein levels improved, his ferritin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate continued to elevate. He was discharged home and was symptom-free within 4 days of hospital discharge.

Discussion

COVID-19 has proven to be a viral disease with a high transmission rate, that has caused over 100,000 deaths in the United States, thus far. The decision to admit a patient must balance the risks of transmission with the benefit of being readily available to provide urgent supportive care should the patient develop complications. Thus, there is a significant benefit to being able to predict poor outcomes. We performed a targeted review of the literature, focusing on clinical and laboratory predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19. Our case report and narrative review outline these findings within the context of our case.

### Marked reactive thrombocytosis in a female with iron deficiency anaemia [^115HbiS5]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This case report presents the clinical evaluation and management of a female patient from a rural background who presented with leg pain, headache, weakness and irritability. Initial investigations revealed iron deficiency anaemia accompanied by a significantly elevated platelet count, prompting suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder. However, subsequent genetic testing ruled out these mutations, suggesting a reactive response to iron deficiency anaemia rather than an independent neoplastic process. Treatment was focused on addressing the underlying iron deficiency anaemia, resulting in significant improvement in the patient's blood profile and resolution of symptoms. Follow-up assessments demonstrated a complete normalisation of the blood profile and platelet counts, further supporting the efficacy of the treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering reactive thrombocytosis in the context of iron deficiency anaemia and emphasises the favourable response achieved through appropriate management strategies.

Remarks add that patients with social concerns, uncertainty about the diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, and more significant mucosal bleeding may benefit from admission to the hospital; patients not admitted to the hospital should receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist, and the need for admission is also highly variable across the range of platelet counts represented (20 × 10⁹/L to 150 × 10⁹/L).

Overview

Essential thrombocythemia is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation-prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal thrombocytosis; clinical course is often indolent but might be interrupted by thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, microcirculatory symptoms (e.g., headaches, lightheadedness, and acral paresthesias), and, less frequently, by disease transformation into myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia.

Diagnosis

In addition to thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L), formal diagnosis requires the exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms, including prefibrotic MF, polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. Bone marrow morphology typically shows increased number of mature-appearing megakaryocytes distributed in loose clusters.

Genetics

Approximately 80% of patients express myeloproliferative neoplasm driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL), in a mutually exclusive manner; in addition, about 50% harbor other mutations, the most frequent being TET2 (9%-11%), ASXL1 (7%-20%), DNMT3A (7%), and SF3B1 (5%). Abnormal karyotype is seen in < 10% of patients and includes +9/20q-/13q-.

Survival and Prognosis

Life expectancy is less than that of the control population. Median survival is approximately 18years but exceeds > 35years in younger patients. The triple A survival risk model, based on Age, Absolute neutrophil count, and Absolute lymphocyte count, effectively delineates high-, intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and low-risk disease with corresponding median survivals of 8, 14, 21, and 47years.

Risk Factors For Thrombosis

Four risk categories are considered: very low (age ≤ 60years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), intermediate (same as low but age > 60years), and high (thrombosis history or age > 60years with JAK2 mutation).

Mutations and Prognosis

MPL and CALR-1 mutations have been associated with increased risk of MF transformation; spliceosome with inferior overall and MF-free survival; TP53 with leukemic transformation, and JAK2V617F with thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rate at 10years is < 1% but might be higher in JAK2-mutated patients with extreme thrombocytosis and those with abnormal karyotype.

Treatment

The main goal of therapy is to prevent thrombosis. In this regard, once-daily low-dose aspirin is advised for all patients and twice daily for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is advised for high-risk and optional for intermediate-risk disease. First-line cytoreductive drugs of choice are hydroxyurea and pegylated interferon-α and second-line busulfan.
