## Question

How do you transition a patient from methadone to suboxone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to transition a patient from methadone to buprenorphine (Suboxone), and wants a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the process. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale and precipitated withdrawal risk. Then, I should verify patient selection and pre-transfer assessment. Next, I will examine methadone dose stratification and setting of care. After that, I need to review induction strategies, including standard, microdosing, and bridging approaches. I will then consider special populations and urgent scenarios. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, stabilization, and post-transfer follow-up, and close with a concise decision framework summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale and the core risk. Buprenorphine's high mu-receptor affinity but lower intrinsic activity can displace methadone and precipitate withdrawal if initiated too early or at too high a dose, especially in patients on higher methadone doses, so timing and dose selection are critical to avoid precipitated withdrawal and to maintain stability during transfer [^113bmEaL] [^113VP5be].

> I need to check the pre-transfer assessment elements that meaningfully change risk and feasibility. A comprehensive evaluation should include current methadone dose, recent substance use including fentanyl, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives, psychiatric comorbidity, medical comorbidity such as cardiac risk, prior experience with buprenorphine, and patient preferences and goals. This informs the choice of strategy and setting and helps anticipate complications during induction [^114hanXs] [^114qCa6y] [^111EE7TM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose thresholds. I should verify what the guidelines say about methadone dose stratification. Patients on low methadone doses, typically 30–40 mg/day or less, generally tolerate transfer with minimal discomfort, whereas those on higher doses face greater risk of precipitated withdrawal and may require more intensive strategies and monitoring; this dose-based risk stratification is consistently emphasized in ASAM guidance and supported by systematic reviews showing lower pretransfer methadone dose correlates with higher transfer success [^113bmEaL] [^114JQqsg] [^111k5H4i].

> Next, I should review the standard induction approach for low-dose methadone patients. The plan is to taper methadone to 30–40 mg/day if feasible, then hold methadone for about 24–48 hours until objective moderate withdrawal appears, typically a COWS of 11–12 or higher. Initiate buprenorphine at 2–4 mg sublingually, observe for precipitated withdrawal, and titrate in 2–8 mg increments every 2–4 hours to a total of 8–16 mg on day 1, aiming for a maintenance range of 12–24 mg/day thereafter, with close follow-up during the first week [^113bmEaL] [^113VP5be] [^111bES2C].

> Wait, let me verify the product choice during induction. For patients transitioning from long-acting full agonists like methadone, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended for induction because naloxone exposure during sublingual administration can theoretically worsen precipitated withdrawal; after stabilization, patients can be transitioned to buprenorphine/naloxone for maintenance to mitigate diversion risk [^112WhAnv].

> I will now examine microdosing strategies, especially for higher methadone doses or when withdrawal intolerance is a concern. Microdosing involves starting very low-dose buprenorphine, for example 0.5–1 mg sublingually, while continuing the full methadone dose, then escalating the buprenorphine dose every 24–48 hours until reaching roughly 12–16 mg/day, at which point methadone is tapered and discontinued; this approach aims to avoid precipitated withdrawal but requires several weeks and close monitoring, with growing but still limited evidence supporting feasibility in outpatient and inpatient settings [^115GjLis] [^113HXtSo] [^115GjLis] [^115GjLis].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a high methadone dose and needs a faster transition with controlled risk. In that scenario, a short-acting full agonist bridge such as oxycodone or hydromorphone can be used for several days while methadone is held, allowing buprenorphine to be initiated once moderate withdrawal emerges. This approach can reduce precipitated withdrawal risk and has been described in inpatient case studies, though it requires careful inpatient supervision and clear discharge planning [^116EeSby] [^111KVUrq].

> I should double-check special populations and urgent indications. For patients with methadone-related QTc prolongation or other serious adverse effects, a rapid inpatient transition may be warranted; case reports describe precipitating withdrawal with naltrexone and then rescuing with buprenorphine within hours, but this is high risk and should be reserved for experienced inpatient teams with close monitoring and informed consent, with naloxone rescue available if needed [^117QG6U4] [^114Ucck8].

> Next, I should review monitoring and stabilization after the first buprenorphine dose. COWS should be assessed every 2–4 hours initially, with observation for precipitated withdrawal, sedation, or respiratory effects. Dose titration should continue until withdrawal is suppressed and the patient is comfortable, typically reaching 12–24 mg/day within the first 1–3 days, followed by transition to maintenance dosing and weekly visits early in treatment with urine drug testing and medication counts to monitor adherence and diversion risk [^113bmEaL] [^111pLDoC] [^116YzSzQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the post-transfer follow-up cadence and safety planning. Weekly visits are recommended during the first month, with more frequent contact if instability is suspected; patients should be counseled on relapse risk during and after transfer, provided naloxone, and engaged in psychosocial treatment as indicated; if destabilization occurs, clinicians should consider restarting methadone rather than forcing an unsuccessful transfer [^111pLDoC] [^115VR8T4] [^114Ucck8].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency. For methadone ≤ 40 mg/day, a standard induction after a 24–48 hour methadone hold is appropriate. For 40–80 mg/day, microdosing or inpatient standard induction with adjuncts may be preferred. For ≥ 80–100 mg/day, inpatient microdosing or a short-acting agonist bridge with specialist oversight is advisable. Across all scenarios, patient preference, comorbidities, and access to care should guide the choice, and there is no single best protocol proven superior in randomized comparisons, so shared decision-making and contingency planning are essential [^113bmEaL] [^111k5H4i] [^114Ucck8].

Transitioning from methadone to Suboxone requires **careful planning** to avoid precipitated withdrawal [^113bmEaL]. The safest approach is to **taper methadone to ≤ 30–40 mg/day** [^114JQqsg], then wait 24–48 hours after the last dose before starting buprenorphine/naloxone at 2–4 mg [^113bmEaL], titrating every 2–4 hours to control withdrawal [^111EE7TM]. For high-dose methadone or intolerance to withdrawal, **microdosing buprenorphine** (starting at 0.5–1 mg/day) while continuing methadone, then tapering methadone over 7–14 days, is effective and avoids precipitated withdrawal [^111K84zQ] [^113HXtSo]. Monitor closely for withdrawal, relapse, and adverse effects, and provide naloxone and psychosocial support throughout [^113BP7wK] [^114S2CK1].

---

## Clinical rationale for transition

Methadone, a full agonist, can cause **precipitated withdrawal** if buprenorphine is started too soon because buprenorphine's high receptor affinity displaces methadone but provides less intrinsic activity [^113VP5be]. Thus, timing and dosing are critical to avoid precipitated withdrawal [^113bmEaL].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

### Pre-transition preparation

- **Assess patient readiness**: Evaluate motivation, stability, and understanding of the transition process [^114qCa6y].

- **Taper methadone dose**: Reduce to ≤ 30–40 mg/day to minimize withdrawal risk [^114JQqsg].

- **Educate patient**: Explain the transition process, potential withdrawal symptoms, and the importance of adherence [^114qCa6y].

---

### Transition strategies

#### Standard transition (low-dose methadone)

- **Wait period**: Hold methadone for 24–48 hours until moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥ 11–12) [^113bmEaL].

- **Initial buprenorphine dose**: Start at 2–4 mg sublingual [^113bmEaL].

- **Titration**: Increase by 2–8 mg every 2–4 hours as needed to control withdrawal, typically reaching 12–16 mg/day [^113bmEaL].

---

#### Microdosing transition (high-dose methadone or intolerance to withdrawal)

- **Initiate buprenorphine**: Begin at 0.5–1 mg/day while continuing methadone [^111K84zQ].

- **Gradual titration**: Increase buprenorphine by 0.5–1 mg every 1–2 days [^113HXtSo].

- **Methadone taper**: Once buprenorphine reaches 4–8 mg/day, taper methadone over 7–14 days [^111K84zQ].

- **Final transition**: Stop methadone when buprenorphine reaches 12–16 mg/day [^113HXtSo].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

- **Frequent visits**: Weekly visits during the first month to monitor stability, adherence, and withdrawal symptoms [^116YzSzQ].

- **Urine drug testing**: Regular testing to monitor adherence and detect illicit drug use [^113BP7wK].

- **Naloxone provision**: Provide naloxone kits and educate on overdose prevention [^112qCsSu].

- **Psychosocial support**: Offer counseling and support services to address underlying issues and prevent relapse [^115VR8T4].

---

## Potential challenges and risks

- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Risk increases with higher methadone doses or shorter wait periods [^113VP5be].

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Common during transition, manageable with careful titration and supportive medications [^113bmEaL].

- **Relapse risk**: Elevated during transition; close monitoring and support are essential [^114Ucck8].

- **Patient dropout**: Risk of discontinuation due to discomfort or lack of support [^116saQnU].

---

## Clinical outcomes and evidence

Evidence supports successful transitions from methadone to buprenorphine, with **lower pre-transfer methadone doses** associated with higher success rates [^111k5H4i]. Microdosing is effective for high-dose methadone patients, minimizing precipitated withdrawal and improving retention [^113xzWsR] [^115GjLis].

## Methadone to Suboxone transition

| **Step** | **Standard transition** | **Microdosing transition** |
|-|-|-|
| Methadone dose | ≤ 30–40 mg/day | Any dose |
| Wait period | 24–48 hours | None |
| Initial buprenorphine dose | 2–4 mg | 0.5–1 mg/day |
| Titration | 2–8 mg every 2–4 hours | 0.5–1 mg every 1–2 days |
| Methadone taper | Stop before buprenorphine | Taper over 7–14 days |
| Monitoring | Frequent visits, urine testing, naloxone | Same as standard |
| Risks | Precipitated withdrawal, relapse | Prolonged transition, adherence issues |

---

Transitioning from methadone to Suboxone requires **careful planning**, patient education, and close monitoring. Tapering methadone to ≤ 30–40 mg/day before initiating buprenorphine is standard, while microdosing is effective for high-dose methadone or intolerance to withdrawal. Frequent visits, urine testing, and psychosocial support are essential to manage withdrawal, prevent relapse, and ensure successful transition [^113bmEaL].

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^114hanXs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder, arising from the use of pharmaceutical and illicit opioids, is a global public health crisis. – The mainstay of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment includes use of primarily buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) or methadone (a full opioid agonist), in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. When used as directed, buprenorphine, alone or in combination with the opioid antagonist naloxone, and methadone are effective and safe. There are medical, practical, and patient preference reasons a provider may initiate treatment with buprenorphine or methadone. During the course of treatment, however, a medication change may be warranted.

Efficacy and/or safety factors are the main reasons for initiating a change in medication. – Logistics of treatment provision may also warrant a change in medication. For example, in some countries, including the United States, methadone is available only at substance use disorder treatment centers, which can pose a logistical burden and carry social stigma. In some settings, patients have greater access to unsupervised dosing with buprenorphine than with methadone, such that patients may wish to transition to buprenorphine to receive care in a less restrictive setting. The recent introduction of long-acting depot buprenorphine formulations may also drive patient demand to transfer from methadone to buprenorphine.

Various guidelines suggest that transferring from transmucosal buprenorphine to methadone is relatively straightforward. For this reason, this review focuses on the more complicated process of transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist with higher affinity for the mu opioid receptor; hence, it can precipitate withdrawal symptoms when switching from full opioid agonists such as methadone. Various factors can affect the patient experience of precipitated withdrawal and successful transfer from methadone to buprenorphine, including the size of the last methadone dose; the interval between methadone and buprenorphine dosing; the induction regimen of buprenorphine; patient expectations; the use of other substances; or psychiatric comorbidities. Several organizations have published guidelines for transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine, but with variations in some parts of the process (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Published Guidelines for Transfer of Patients From Methadone to Buprenorphine ∗

A 2012 review of studies that transferred patients from methadone to buprenorphine included many studies that used buprenorphine as a brief intermediate treatment in the process of ceasing MOUD entirely, or in laboratory studies in which patients were immediately returned to methadone. The purpose of this paper is to update and review the currently available evidence on transfer strategies used in clinical trials and observational studies of longer-term treatment with buprenorphine or methadone and to consider whether any strategies yield better clinical outcomes than others.

Criminal justice system — Transition, release, and overdose prevention — If an OTP is not accessible, providers may need to transition individuals from methadone to buprenorphine, acknowledging that effectively transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine can be challenging but can be achieved safely if managed by a provider experienced in the procedure. Risk for relapse and overdose is particularly high in the weeks immediately following release from jail or prison, and patient care on reentry to the community should be individualized and coordinated with treatment providers in the community. Naloxone kits should be available with correctional facilities, individuals with opioid use disorder should receive a naloxone kit prior to release, and individuals and families should be educated in how to administer naloxone.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Recommendation 8 (opioid use disorder): For patients with opioid use disorder for whom opioid withdrawal management is indicated, we suggest using buprenorphine/naloxone (in any setting), or methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone in inpatient or accredited Opioid Treatment Programs, and this recommendation is labeled (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Opioid withdrawal management is only indicated under certain circumstances, and if medically supervised withdrawal is indicated, the preferred approach is initial stabilization with methadone or buprenorphine followed by a short or extended taper; buprenorphine and methadone maintenance are recommended for the treatment of OUD based on multiple RCTs and meta-analyses.

Withdrawal management with opioid agonists — methadone and buprenorphine notes that methadone and buprenorphine are both recommended for management of opioid withdrawal, and withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an OTP or inpatient setting. Opioid withdrawal management, on its own, without ongoing pharmacotherapy, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate to the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If the decision is made to taper, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and methadone tapers generally start with doses in the range of 20–30 mg per day and are completed in 6–10 days.

Buprenorphine treatment — transitioning between medications: Transitioning from buprenorphine to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining their treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction, and no time delay is required in transitioning a patient from buprenorphine to treatment with methadone. For naltrexone initiation, buprenorphine has a long half-life; 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids, a naloxone challenge may be useful to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence, and investigators have begun to evaluate rapid transition methods using repeated very low naltrexone doses with ancillary medications over several days.

Pain management in patients on chronic opioid therapy or with opioid use disorder — switching from buprenorphine to methadone on admission with acute pain is described as "a potential, uncommon third option", and "Methadone at 30–40 mg per day will manage the baseline opioid requirement and help prevent withdrawal for most patients, and it may allow full mu agonists such as morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone to provide additional pain relief more predictably"; however, "the eventual transition back to buprenorphine may be challenging with this approach".

### Enhancing patient choice: using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^114JJGrb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal — an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^111KVUrq]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Opioid agonist therapy can be considered a bridge to several potential treatment pathways for hospitalized patients with OUD. For a patient who is initially reluctant to initiate MOUD, an alternate opioid agonist such as oxycodone or hydromorphone can be utilized to effectively manage pain and opioid withdrawal during the initial phase of hospitalization, buying time to revisit interest in MOUD when initial symptoms are better controlled. Regarding transition to buprenorphine, prescription oxycodone has a more predictable half-life than illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and when timed properly, the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal during transitions from oxycodone to buprenorphine can be all but eliminated. For a patient interested in methadone treatment, oxycodone can be utilized to control pain and withdrawal symptoms until methadone can be titrated to effective dosing. What about the patient who is uninterested in MOUD? A patient with OUD and significant opioid dependence should not be required to accept MOUD to receive medical care, and treatment with opioid agonist therapies during a period of hospitalization can be considered a safe bridge to continued opioid use after discharge, protecting a patient's opioid tolerance as a form of harm reduction, and ultimately mitigating the risk of fatal overdose following hospitalization.

### Evaluation of buprenorphine rotation in patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain: a systematic review [^113a5npa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Rotation Protocols

Buprenorphine rotation protocols were diverse. Of the 17 unique protocols that were identified, 9 were adaptations of protocols that were originally intended for buprenorphine induction in individuals with OUD without chronic pain. These 9 protocols required the presence of mild opioid withdrawal symptoms before the first buprenorphine dose and/or low starting doses, reassessment of withdrawal symptoms, and additional dose administration if needed. Eight protocols instructed individuals to stop opioids 8 to 24 hours before the first buprenorphine dose, and 3 protocols required an overnight waiting period. Individuals who were switching from methadone hydrochloride or transdermal fentanyl were instructed to wait longer (about 36–72 hours).,

In 2 protocols, participants were randomized to structured buprenorphine tapering conditions; in 1 study, participants were allowed to switch to the steady-dose group if they could not tolerate the tapering. Another protocol required that patients were unable to taper their previous opioid use before being offered buprenorphine rotation. In 10 of 14 protocols without a structured tapering condition, rotation to buprenorphine was reported as completely voluntary. For the 4 remaining protocols, it was not specified whether rotation was voluntary or a contingency of ongoing treatment.,

Buccal or sublingual buprenorphine was used exclusively in 13 protocols, often in combination with naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate. Transdermal buprenorphine was used exclusively in 2 protocols. Two protocols provided multiple buprenorphine formulations. Buprenorphine sublingual or buccal dosing varied widely, from a first-day total dose of 600 μgto a maximum possible dose of 32 mg. Nine protocols divided administration into 2 to 4 doses per day. Transdermal buprenorphine dosing also varied widely, from 5 μg/hto 140 μg/h. The study by Tang et alapplied a microdose approach to minimize anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, whereby a lower-dose transdermal formulation of buprenorphine served as a bridge to higher sublingual doses. Ten protocols allowed additional medication to ease symptoms of withdrawal, although specific medications varied., eTable 6 in the Supplement describes the buprenorphine rotation protocols.

### Patients maintained on buprenorphine for opioid use disorder should continue buprenorphine through the perioperative period [^116jo7Lu]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In response to rising rates of opioid overdose and addiction, growing numbers of patients with opioid use disorder are being transitioned from Schedule II prescription and illicit opioids to buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone. From 2010 to 2016, annual prescriptions for buprenorphine products more than doubled, while other categories of opioid prescriptions remained level or decreased. Physicians are faced with the clinical dilemma of what to do when patients on buprenorphine need surgery.

In the absence of convincing evidence that continuing buprenorphine leads to poorer outcomes, and in light of the risks associated with discontinuing buprenorphine, we recommend that patients with opioid use disorder on buprenorphine therapy continue the medication throughout the peri-operative period, as well as in situations requiring urgent/emergent analgesia. For patients on higher doses of buprenorphine (more than 12 mg daily) scheduled to undergo painful procedures such as total joint replacement or open abdominal surgery, we have developed a protocol to lower the dose but still maintain buprenorphine through the peri-operative period (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Perioperative Buprenorphine Protocol.

Buprenorphine is a Schedule III opioid that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder and pain (in some formulations). Because of its unique pharmacologic properties, it poses lower risks of misuse, respiratory suppression, and accidental overdose. Buprenorphine is also a partial agonist: due to tight binding at the mu opioid receptor and attenuated intrinsic activity, buprenorphine blocks some effects of other opioids a patient may take or be prescribed. Therefore, whether to continue buprenorphine when using other opioids to manage acute or peri-operative pain has become an issue of controversy and public health significance.

Published guidelines and opinions in the United States recommend discontinuing buprenorphine well in advance of anticipated pain or major surgery. The US Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) in its 2004 Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) stated, "While patients are taking opioid pain medications, the administration of buprenorphine generally should be discontinued". The 2004 CSAT guidelines have had an outsized influence on medical practice, and the discontinuation of buprenorphine prior to surgery has become the de facto standard of care. These recommendations derive from published cases of difficult-to-treat acute pain in buprenorphine-maintained patients; but these case reports are not universally persuasive. They may primarily reflect the challenge of managing already opioid-tolerant and -dependent patients in need of analgesia, as opposed to difficulties related to buprenorphine per se.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1113wD29]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine or naltrexone notes that patients transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should ideally be on low doses of methadone before making the transition, and patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in transitioning medications. For naltrexone, patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone, with the only exception applying when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111EE7TM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In April 2021, to expand access to buprenorphine, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder exempted eligible physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives from previous Controlled Substances Act certification requirements related to training, counseling and other ancillary services (i.e. psychosocial services). To prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder for up to 30 patients in an office-based setting, clinicians can forgo or choose to undertake training but must still receive a waiver from SAMHSA. Information about qualifications and the process to obtain a waiver are available from SAMHSA.

Additional recommendations have been published on initiation, use, and monitoring of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder is usually combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal film or tablet (e.g. Suboxone), to reduce the potential for misuse of buprenorphine when injected. Naloxone is poorly absorbed orally; however, if buprenorphine/naloxone is manipulated and injected, naloxone can trigger opioid withdrawal. In 2018, long-acting injectable formulations of buprenorphine became available. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine should generally not be initiated until there are objective signs of withdrawal, to avoid precipitating withdrawal. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described a low-dose initiation approach (sometimes referred to as microdosing) to avoid precipitating withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine, although evidence regarding this approach is limited. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation is a potential option for patients with opioid use disorder who are taking opioid medications for pain. With this dosing strategy, full agonist opioids can be continued while buprenorphine is initiated, and the patient does not need to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms. For standard (not low-dose) buprenorphine initiation, after objective signs of withdrawal are observed, buprenorphine should be initiated and titrated upward under supervision at approximately 2-hour intervals as needed to control withdrawal symptoms. Protocols for initiating buprenorphine by patients at home after an initial encounter with a clinician to establish the diagnosis of opioid use disorder and discuss medication options are in use by more experienced clinicians.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113ZGigH]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Recommendation O-26 — buprenorphine initiation and monitoring — states that buprenorphine should be initiated when the patient shows objective signs of opioid withdrawal; the patient should be monitored for precipitated withdrawal for at least 30 minutes after the initial administration of buprenorphine, and if precipitated withdrawal occurs and a prescriber is not immediately available to assess, the patient should be transferred to a hospital. A footnote notes that buprenorphine may be initiated prior to the emergence of objective signs of withdrawal when using a low-dose buprenorphine initiation protocol.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^1155ixE6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite more than 20 years of research, our evidence base for informing optimal approaches to transfer from methadone to buprenorphine remains limited. Few studies have used designs that enable comparison of different approaches; thus, only general recommendations can be reached. Most international clinical guidelines provide recommendations consistent with the available evidence. However, clinical guidelines should be seen as providing "guidance" rather than "protocols" to be adhered to, and clinicians and patients need to exercise judgment in attempting transfers.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111pLDoC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine management — clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion; recommended strategies may include frequent office visits (e.g., weekly in early treatment), drug testing including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for medication counts. Drug testing should be used to monitor patients for adherence to buprenorphine and use of illicit and controlled substances, and patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of treatment until they are determined to be stable. When transitioning from buprenorphine to naltrexone, 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last buprenorphine dose and the start of naltrexone, whereas when transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone there is no required time delay. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine, and buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process with close monitoring recommended; buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1157E1ZK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone (Part 6) — extended-release injectable naltrexone is a recommended treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder in patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids, able to give informed consent, and have no contraindications. It should generally be administered every 4 weeks by deep IM injection in the gluteal muscle at the set dosage of 380 mg per injection, and some patients may benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is not recommended except under limited circumstances. There is no recommended length of treatment with naltrexone; because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. Transitioning from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored; initial methadone or buprenorphine doses should be low, and transition should not occur until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone, and a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay naltrexone treatment; motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. Patients who discontinue naltrexone should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, if they return to illicit opioid use; treatment alternatives including methadone, buprenorphine, and overdose prevention with naloxone should be discussed.

### Transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine: the feasibility and evaluation of practice guidelines [^117V7whr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction and Aims

Transfer from methadone to buprenorphine is problematic for many opioid-dependent patients, with limited documented evidence or practical clinical guidance, particularly for the range of methadone doses routinely prescribed for most patients (> 50mg). This study aimed to implement and evaluate recent national Australian guidelines for transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine.

Design and Methods

A multisite prospective cohort study. Participants were patients who transferred from methadone to buprenorphine-naloxone at 1 of 4 specialist addiction centers in Australia and New Zealand. Clinicians were trained in the guidelines, and medical records were reviewed to examine process (eg, transfer setting, doses, and guideline adherence) and safety (precipitated withdrawal) measures. Participants completed research interviews before and after transfer-assessing changes in substance use, health outcomes, and side effects.

Results

In all, 33 participants underwent transfer, 9 from low methadone doses (< 30mg), 9 from medium doses (30–50mg), and 15 from high doses (> 50mg). The majority of high-dose transfers occurred in inpatient settings. There was reasonable guideline adherence, and no complications identified in the low and medium-dose transfers. Three high-dose transfers (20%) experienced precipitated withdrawal, and 7/33 participants (21%) returned to methadone within 1 week of attempted transfer.

Discussions and Conclusions

Transfer is feasible in outpatient settings for those transferring from methadone doses below 50mg; however, inpatient settings and specialist supervision is recommended for higher-dose transfers. The Australian clinical guidelines appear safe and feasible, although further research is required to optimize high-dose transfer procedures.

Preparing the Patient for the Transfer

The patients' motivation is key to the transition and the success of the change in treatment; reasons can vary but there is a need for a clear commitment and drive for the change from the patient. In this case, the patient is looking for abstinence from opioids eventually; he has struggled to achieve this with methadone treatment before and has found the process less challenging using buprenorphine treatment previously. The patient should be reminded of the potential differences in treatments and encouraged to relate his buprenorphine experiences back to you. In particular, the mental health issues after the patient's son's death might be worth checking as patients can report difficulty adjusting to perceived increased clarity of thinking after discontinuation of high doses of full opioid agonists. The patient may need additional support and wraparound services in case he starts to struggle with persistent negative thoughts unclouded by partial opioid agonist effects. Other factors to be discussed include the reason for the change to buprenorphine and assessing whether the patient is likely to do well on buprenorphine.

Key considerations when transferring individuals from higher doses of methadone to sublingual buprenorphine are the risk of precipitating withdrawal on initiation of buprenorphine and the risk of destabilizing the patient regarding their substance use, or medical, psychiatric, or social conditions. To minimize the risk of these occurring, it is important to complete a comprehensive assessment of the current physical and mental health and substance use history focusing on the most recent drug use, thereby ensuring that the transfer process is not complicated by other substance use including benzodiazepines, pharmaceutical opioids, or other sedating agents.

As with any of the transition between treatments discussed below, it is necessary to discuss the process and options clearly, explaining the advantages and disadvantages and confirming the patient's expectations from this and for treatment after the transfer. Even in this case, where the patient has had both treatment options previously, it is important to remind the patient of the different effects he may experience due to the different treatments. Once the patient has consented and is well prepared for the admission, if undergoing an in-patient transfer, and the regulatory processes are completed as appropriate, the procedure can be initiated.

### Buprenorphine microdose induction for the management of prescription opioid dependence [^111FMwbh]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prescription opioid dependence remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Patients previously on high-dose opioids may poorly tolerate opioid tapers. Current guidelines support the use of buprenorphine therapy in opioid-tapering protocols, even among patients without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine microinduction protocols can be used to transition patients to buprenorphine therapy without opioid withdrawal. From November 2019 to April 2020, we transitioned 8 patients on high-dose prescribed opioids for pain to sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone using a microdose protocol without any evidence of precipitated withdrawal. Six of these patients remain on buprenorphine-naloxone and report improved analgesia. Because of its simplicity, the buprenorphine microinduction protocol can be easily adapted for telemedicine and may help to prevent unnecessary clinic visits and opioid-related admissions in the setting of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^111YtNZg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methadone Taper

The mean final dose of methadone 5 days before transfer to buprenorphine, ranged from 19 mg to 78 mg, with an overall weighted mean of 46 mg. Methadone was discontinued with no apparent dose reduction in 9 studies. including 2 of the 4 studies that included patients taking relatively high doses of methadone.

Seven studies used a fixed or flexible methadone dose taper. In one of these studies, taper was offered to patients, but it is not reported whether any patients chose that strategy. In another study, one of 3 groups was randomized to taper.

Concomitant Medications

Many studies allowed adjunctive medications to relieve withdrawal symptoms during the transfer. These included lofexidine, clonidine, benzodiazepines, analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and loperamide (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Presence of Withdrawal Features and Timing of the Initial Dose of Buprenorphine

Most studies required patients to exhibit features of opiate withdrawal before initiating buprenorphine, though many did not objectively describe the severity of withdrawal. Four studies required patients to reach a threshold on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) before induction of buprenorphine treatment. Thresholds were COWS scores > 10, ≥ 10, ≥ 12, and ≥ 13. Buprenorphine was given no sooner than 42 hours after the last methadone dose in 2 studies, and no sooner than 24 hours in a third; the interval duration was not reported in the fourth study.

In 4 studies, patients were provided an initial dose of buprenorphine at a set time since the last methadone dose, potentially regardless of the presence of withdrawal symptoms.,

Buprenorphine Induction

Only 1 study tested different buprenorphine induction protocols. Patients were randomized to a slow, moderate, or rapid transfer after methadone discontinuation (no taper; details in Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Buprenorphine Product

Almost all studies used single-ingredient buprenorphine, but 6, used buprenorphine combined with naloxone. One study used the single-ingredient product in the first part of the study but switched to the combination product when it became available. Various routes of administration were used, but in most of the studies, buprenorphine was administered sublingually (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Details about each study's dosing strategies are provided in Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2; the general strategies are summarized here.

### Management of opioid use disorder, opioid withdrawal, and opioid overdose prevention in hospitalized adults: a systematic review of existing guidelines [^1155UXC9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations related to the consequences of opioid use are rising. National guidelines directing in-hospital opioid use disorder (OUD) management do not exist. OUD treatment guidelines intended for other treatment settings could inform in-hospital OUD management.

Objective

Evaluate the quality and content of existing guidelines for OUD treatment and management.

Data Sources

OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid PsychINFO, EBSCOhost CINHAL, ERCI Guidelines Trust, websites of relevant societies and advocacy organizations, and selected international search engines.

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2010 to June 2020 addressing OUD treatment, opioid withdrawal management, opioid overdose prevention, and care transitions among adults.

Data Extraction

We assessed quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.

Data Synthesis

Nineteen guidelines met the selection criteria. Most recommendations were based on observational studies or expert consensus. Guidelines recommended the use of nonstigmatizing language among patients with OUD; to assess patients with unhealthy opioid use for OUD using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Diseases-5th Edition criteria; use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat OUD and opioid withdrawal; use of multimodal, nonopioid therapy, and when needed, short-acting opioid analgesics in addition to buprenorphine or methadone, for acute pain management; ensuring linkage to ongoing methadone or buprenorphine treatment; referring patients to psychosocial treatment; and ensuring access to naloxone for opioid overdose reversal.

Conclusions

Included guidelines were informed by studies with various levels of rigor and quality. Future research should systematically study buprenorphine and methadone initiation and titration among people using fentanyl and people with pain, especially during hospitalization.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114JQqsg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to methadone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to ensure that patients transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine are on low doses of methadone before making the transition. Recognize that patients on low doses of methadone (≤ 30–40 mg/day) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in transitioning medications.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (Suboxone) [^113fCyZZ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients taking heroin or other short-acting
opioids:

At treatment initiation, the dose of SUBUTEX should be
administered at least 4 hours after the patient last used opioids or preferably
when early signs of opioid withdrawal appear.

Patients on methadone or other long-acting
opioids:

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of
methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that
withdrawal symptoms are possible during induction to buprenorphine treatment.
Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of
methadone (> 30mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered
shortly after the last methadone dose.

Maintenance:

SUBOXONE is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment
due to the presence of naloxone in the formulation.

Adjusting the dose until the maintenance dose is
achieved:

The recommended target dose of SUBOXONE is 16 mg/day. Clinical
studies have shown that 16mg of SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE is a clinically effective
dose compared with placebo and indicate that doses as low as 12 mg may be
effective in some patients. The dosage of SUBOXONE should be progressively
adjusted in increments / decrements of 2mg or 4mg to a level that holds the
patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal effects. This is likely to
be in the range of 4mg to 24mg per day depending on the individual.

Reducing dosage and stopping treatment:

The decision to discontinue therapy with SUBOXONE or SUBUTEX
after a period of maintenance or brief stabilization should be made as part of a
comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation have been
used, but no controlled trials have been undertaken to determine the best method
of dose taper at the end of treatment.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113BP7wK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Buprenorphine monitoring, diversion control, transitions, and duration: Clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion, with recommended strategies that may include frequent office visits (e.g., weekly in early treatment), drug testing including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for medication counts, and drug testing should be used to monitor patients for adherence to buprenorphine and use of illicit and controlled substances. Patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of treatment until they are determined to be stable, and when transitioning from buprenorphine to naltrexone providers should note that 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone, whereas when transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone there is no required time delay. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine, and patients who discontinue treatment should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of death if they return to illicit opioid use, with treatment alternatives including methadone and naltrexone and opioid overdose prevention with naloxone discussed with any patient choosing to taper off buprenorphine. Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process, close monitoring is recommended, buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months, and patients should be encouraged to remain in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of discontinuation.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115VR8T4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — psychosocial care and relapse management with methadone specifies that Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed, and patients should be offered evidence-based psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs, in conjunction with methadone in the treatment of opioid use disorder, and that a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay treatment with methadone, with appropriate medication management; motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. For patients who previously received methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder, methadone should be reinstituted immediately if relapse occurs or if an assessment determines that the risk of relapse is high (unless contraindicated), and strategies directed at relapse prevention are an important part of addiction treatment and should be included in any plan of care for a patient receiving opioid use disorder treatment or ongoing monitoring of the status of their disorder. Transitioning from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences dangerous or intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^11446kiB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Having a range of potential options for the transition between methadone and buprenorphine is essential, and it is important to discuss these with each patient in advance to identify which method may be preferable for them, discussing the pros and cons of each and addressing any fears or concerns that they may have in relation to the process. By involving the patient in the choice of transition method, they will have more involvement in the process. In respect to the recent review, it can be seen that various options have been investigated, which all have advantages and disadvantages, therefore providing a number of possible options for patients dependent on their risks and preferences. Offering a range and getting the patient involved in these discussions may increase their engagement in the process and hopefully their success in transferring treatments. The review, however, does point out that there is still a limited evidence base for the transfer processes and unfortunately there is no clear strategy that one is better than the others. It is therefore important to note that while the available research does not support routine application of a single transfer strategy, it does support the narrative of positive outcomes described in these case vignettes. The reviewclearly indicates that most patients who initiate a transfer from methadone to buprenorphine do achieve a stable buprenorphine dose and successfully complete the transfer.

It is important to recognize that these results (based on the reviewand the above cases) are achieved in settings where patients are managed by experienced clinicians. In the absence of clear evidence, clinical experience and expert opinion are necessary to guide treatment. Available international clinical guidelines are derived from published clinical experience, therefore providing recommendations consistent with the available evidence. However, clinical guidelines should be seen as providing "guidance" rather than "protocols" for adherence. Although new approaches,– seems promising, further evidence of the safety and effectiveness of such approaches are required before they can be considered "routine" practice or occur outside of specialist sector services. This emphasizes the importance of clinicians and patients preparing in advance for the transfer exercising their judgment, based on the available evidence, as to which procedure is best suited for their particular transfer.

Transitioning from methadone to naltrexone — complete opioid withdrawal is required and timing plus naloxone challenge are provided. "Patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone have to be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before they can receive naltrexone". "This may take up to 14 days, but can typically be achieved in 7 days". "A naloxone challenge (administration of 0.4–0.8 mg naloxone and observation for precipitated withdrawal) may be useful before initiating treatment with naltrexone to document the absence of physiological dependence and to minimize the risk for precipitated withdrawal".

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to plan and monitor transitioning from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Recognize that transitioning from an antagonist (naltrexone) to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Start methadone or buprenorphine with initial low doses as patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have a physical dependence on opioids. Do not make the transition until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

Concluding Comment Regarding the Application of the Case Conference to Practice

As a final thought, through the process (irrespective of the transition method), it should be remembered that the patient is going to go through a challenging time as they transition from methadone to buprenorphine, which can allow other suppressed emotions to come to the surface and be a potential time for relapse, and as such the warning signs and dangers of using illicit substances should be clearly discussed and the provision of take home naloxone should be made to further encourage the patient's safety.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^1121NHvD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Once the process has started for the patient, it is necessary to work closely with them, with appointments more regularly than normal (a minimum of weekly appointments during the transition) to ensure the titration for buprenorphine is being tolerated and there are no signs of opioid toxicity. Appointments can be altered on an individual basis in response to the patient's progress or symptoms, thus altering the rate of increase of buprenorphine or reducing full opioid agonist doses as required.

For the patient in this scenario, this may be a good option as he has been treated with both methadone and buprenorphine previously but finds the reductions in methadone dose challenging and he struggles more with the withdrawal symptoms experienced. Additionally, looking beyond the transfer to buprenorphine, he reported that in the past he has found detoxing from buprenorphine is easier for him. The microdosing technique may provide a method of transitioning involving few if any withdrawal effects and, as such, appeal to the patient more than the other options of a slow and gradual reduction in methadone dose or the potential withdrawals (albeit for a brief period of time) experienced with the transition phase of an HDT. The process is then through the regular reviews tailored to his progress. However, one of the negatives for the process is the need for the regular contact and that the process can extend over a few weeks to complete.

Although demonstrating that these guidelines are feasible and enable safe transfer for patients from lower methadone doses and for most patients even at higher doses, it does not exclude that other transfer approaches may prove to be useful, particularly for HD transfers. In particular, the use of shorter-acting full opioid agonists (eg, morphine, oxycodone) as a transition between methadone and buprenorphine warrants further exploration.

### Enhancing patient choice: using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^11767MsM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This case builds on EMS experience starting buprenorphine directly after naloxone reversal of opioid overdose. There is also an emergency department report of a patient choosing intravenous naloxone, followed by initiation of sublingual buprenorphine, to begin treatment while monitored. Although our case differs in a number of key ways, these reports support further study of voluntary naloxone use to expedite BUP-NX initiation. Our case also lends support for a higher first dose of BUP-NX when patients are transitioning from fentanyl. As with other approaches, rapid initiation has risks, but none that compare with ongoing use of lethal opioids.

Standard buprenorphine initiations require patients to wait after their last full agonist use and experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Very low-dose buprenorphine transitions intentionally minimize withdrawal, but patients usually continue illicit opioid use while gradually increasing their daily buprenorphine dose over several days to weeks; a recent review found this transition to take a median of 8 days (range, 3–120 days). Although very low-dose and low-dose transitions aim to avoid precipitated withdrawal, it can still occur. High-dose (defined as total dosing up to 32 mg) initiation has been done in emergency departments, but these protocols also require patients to wait at least 12 hours since their last use before taking a first buprenorphine dose. Outpatient use of the high-dose method has not yet been described.

DISCUSSION

There have been few well-conducted, adequately powered, randomized studies that enable firm conclusions to be drawn regarding optimal transfer strategies. Most identified studies were observational case series with little harmonization between studies on how study populations, procedures, and outcomes were defined or reported, complicating comparisons across studies. Nonetheless, we identified a number of key variables previously documented as being important in understanding the transfer process and outcomes. Those factors are commonly described in clinical practice guidelines, and an aim of this review was to identify whether the available evidence can provide greater clarity in transfer recommendations.

Our review identified high correlations between many of these factors, highlighting that they are not independent of each other and complicate the interpretation of each variable in isolation, particularly as no studies have used proper study designs (eg, randomization) or had sufficient patient numbers to enable these factors to be assessed independently. Another difficulty in comparing strategies was the high rates of successful completion of transfers reported: most approaches reported achieved positive outcomes a majority of the time.

Although there is limited clinical utility in examining single transfer components because they are by design part of an interconnected process, the extreme heterogeneity of the included studies' designs, populations, drug formulations, and outcome measurements made it unfeasible to group and examine "transfer strategies".

Our findings suggest that, while no "best" or "optimal" method of transfer can be identified from the available studies, some conclusions can be drawn. Successful transfer (defined loosely as having reached and maintained a stable dose of buprenorphine) was statistically significantly associated with lower pretransfer methadone dose, particularly below methadone doses of 60 mg. Although many of the included studies found that pretransfer methadone reduction did not affect transfer completion, it may remain good clinical practice to do so when attempting to transition patients. However, where dose reduction is difficult to achieve, the evidence does not preclude the transfer of patients from higher methadone doses up to 100 mg – most studies at such dose levels reported favorable outcomes, which indicates that higher dose transfer are possible although may be somewhat more difficult to achieve.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113f6fy3]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Treating patients currently receiving buprenorphine or methadone — Patients in treatment for OUD who are not engaging in illegal drug use, including those who are prescribed medication to treat their OUD, are protected from discrimination, and by law patients meeting these criteria who enter jail should be allowed to continue medications for SUD treatment in consultation with clinical providers; continuation of treatment while incarcerated lowers the odds of reincarceration and increases the odds of remaining in treatment. Methadone withdrawal is a painful experience that can deter restarting; partnerships between jails and a methadone treatment provider can facilitate continued access for patients treated prior to incarceration. Transition from methadone to buprenorphine can be medically complex because of methadone's long duration of action and the risk for precipitated withdrawal, whereas transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone does not pose this risk; if discontinuation of methadone or buprenorphine is clinically indicated, services of a medical provider with SUD treatment expertise (board certified or with 2 or more years of experience in specialty SUD treatment) are required. Methadone can be difficult to access and discontinuation increases risk of return to use, so reentry planning upon initiation is essential.

### Transition from methadone to buprenorphine using a short-acting agonist bridge in the inpatient setting: a case study [^116EeSby]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methadone and buprenorphine are the most common medications for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine is often the preferred medication because of fewer drug-drug interactions and fewer regulatory barriers. For these reasons, patients often desire to transition from methadone to buprenorphine, but this can be difficult because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal. There are protocols designed to minimize withdrawal; however, these can be time-consuming or infeasible due to formulation and dosage availability of buprenorphine. We describe an inpatient transition from methadone to buprenorphine using a hydromorphone bridge over a 7-day period. This method used commonly available dosages and formulations of buprenorphine. To our knowledge, this is the first time a method has been described that transitions a patient from methadone to buprenorphine using a short-acting opioid agonist bridge and readily available opioid dosages and formulations. This case provides a viable alternative for rapidly transitioning a patient from methadone to buprenorphine that can be used as a template for an alternative method to transitions between these medications.

Initial Buprenorphine Dose on First Day

The weighted mean initial buprenorphine dose on the first day was 3.3 mg. In 10 studies, the initial buprenorphine dose on the first day was fixed. In another study, the initial buprenorphine dose was administered via a transdermal patch that delivered 35 μg/h. The remaining studies allowed the initial dose on the first day to vary.,

Most studies assessed response to the initial dose of buprenorphine and administered at least 1 additional dose later on the first day if response was insufficient. However, in 6 studies –, and 1 arm of a seventh, patients received only a single first-day buprenorphine dose.

Total First-day Dose of Buprenorphine

The crude and weighted mean total buprenorphine doses on the first day were 8.6 and 7.8 mg, respectively. The lowest total first-day fixed dose was 2 mg, and the lowest possible total first-day flexible-dose was 1 mg. The highest initial fixed or flexible total daily dose on the first day was 32 mg.

### Transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine: the feasibility and evaluation of practice guidelines [^116mFfPc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The most widely prescribed medicines in the treatment of opioid dependence are methadone and buprenorphine. Whereas both are safe and effective medicines for this indication, optimizing treatment outcomes for individual patients requires some patients to transition from one to the other. More common reasons for transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine are in response to side effects to methadone, dose not holding (eg, rapid metabolizers), or in attempts to withdraw off opioid agonist treatment. However, transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine is complicated by the potential for precipitated withdrawal on commencing buprenorphine — thought to be due to buprenorphine's higher receptor affinity, but lower intrinsic activity (partial agonist) at μ-opioid receptors. Early clinical guidelines recommended patients reduce to a low methadone dose (eg, 30–40 mg or less) before transferring to buprenorphine or to discontinue methadone for several days before initiating buprenorphine dosing. Yet, these approaches can be problematic as most methadone patients require much higher doses to achieve positive treatment outcomes (eg, 60–100 mg), and risk relapse to unsanctioned substance use, and/or deterioration in health or social status while attempting dose reductions.

There is limited documented evidence reflecting the experience of transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine. A systematic review of such transfers identified 16 studies reporting on 240 patient transfers — most were uncontrolled studies with few cases, and few studies reported on transfers from high doses (designated as ≥ 70 mg). The review identified that transfers from doses below 70 mg were feasible using abrupt cessation or taper on an outpatient basis, often with ancillary medications and a 24-hour interval between medications. In contrast, transfers from higher methadone doses usually required inpatient treatment and ancillary medications, and precipitated withdrawal was reported in a substantial minority of cases. The authors concluded that "due to differences in design and individual variability, a single protocol cannot be formulated" (p. 5).

Nevertheless, the need for clinical guidance is highlighted by the potential problems associated with attempted transfers that have served as transfer barriers. These include patients becoming "unstable" during methadone dose reductions or following transfer, with relapse to substance use or deterioration in mental health; precipitated withdrawal on initiating buprenorphine treatment; adverse events after transfer; and patients requesting transfer back to methadone.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to methadone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to withdraw methadone and other opioids completely in patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone before they can receive naltrexone. Recognize that the only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Naloxone in pregnancy — use and cautions. There is insufficient research on naloxone safety and efficacy during pregnancy, and if a woman becomes pregnant while receiving naloxone it may be appropriate to transition to methadone or buprenorphine; using naloxone to evaluate opioid dependence in pregnant women is contraindicated because induced withdrawal may precipitate preterm labor or fetal distress.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^114bZrZj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review the currently available evidence on transfer strategies from methadone to sublingual buprenorphine used in clinical trials and observational studies of medication for opioid use disorder treatment, and to consider whether any strategies yield better clinical outcomes than others.

Methods

Six medical and public health databases were searched for articles and conference abstracts. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were used to identify unpublished trial results. Records were dually screened, and data were extracted and checked independently. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when possible, analyzed quantitatively.

Results

Eighteen studies described transfer from methadone to buprenorphine. Transfer protocols were extremely varied. Most studies reported successful rates of transfer, even among studies involving transfer from high methadone doses, although lower pretransfer methadone dose was significantly associated with higher rate of successful transfer. Precipitated withdrawal was not reported frequently. A range of innovative approaches to transfer from methadone to buprenorphine remains untested.

Conclusions

Few studies have used designs that enable comparison of different approaches to transfer patients from methadone to buprenorphine. Most international clinical guidelines provide recommendations consistent with the available evidence. However, clinical guidelines should be perceived as providing "guidance" rather than "protocols", and clinicians and patients need to exercise judgment when attempting transfers.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to take into account the setting for the initiation of buprenorphine. View both office-based and home-based initiation as safe and effective when starting buprenorphine treatment. Use clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate setting for a given patient and consider including consideration of the patient's past experience with buprenorphine and assessment of their ability to manage initiation at home.

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products, the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products may be induced with either ZUBSOLV or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of ZUBSOLV should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids, to avoid precipitating an opioid withdrawal syndrome.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too-gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 5.7 mg/1.4 mg ZUBSOLV is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 1.4 mg/0.36 mg ZUBSOLV. The remainder of the Day 1 dose of up to 4.2 mg/1.08 mg should be divided into doses of 1 to 2 tablets of 1.4 mg/0.36 mg at 1.5 to 2 hour intervals. Some patients (e.g., those with recent exposure to buprenorphine) may tolerate up to 3 x 1.4 mg/0.36 mg ZUBSOLV as a single, second dose.

On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 11.4 mg/2.9 mg ZUBSOLV is recommended.

Patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products

Patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products.

Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for induction in patients who are physically dependent on long-acting opioid products, and the naloxone in these combination products is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precipitated and prolonged withdrawal. For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long-acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions. Following induction, the patient may then be transitioned to once-daily ZUBSOLV.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine. Inform patients discontinuing buprenorphine treatment of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death if they return to illicit opioid use. Discuss treatment alternatives including methadone and naltrexone as well as opioid overdose prevention with naloxone with any patient choosing to discontinue treatment.

### Transitioning from high-dose methadone to buprenorphine using a microdosing approach: unique considerations at ASAM level 3 facilities [^113xzWsR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Transitions from high-dose methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) present risk of precipitated withdrawal related to the introduction of a high-affinity partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor after occupancy by a lower-affinity full agonist. Various strategies have been explored to maintain patient stability during this process, including microdosing buprenorphine. Current literature lacks consensus on an optimal setting and strategy for initiating a buprenorphine microdosing protocol and gives little detail on patients' conditions after the acute transition period. We report a 6-day microdosing transition from methadone 100 mg directly to sublingual buprenorphine, followed by a 20-day period of monitoring and additional treatment. This patient tolerated a sublingual buprenorphine microdosing protocol while using supportive medications with a peak Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score of 6. The patient's most significant withdrawal symptoms occurred several days after completion of the microdosing process. This case demonstrates the feasibility of using a transmucosal buprenorphine formulation in microdosing transitions from high-dose methadone directly to buprenorphine, and highlights the utility of a medically monitored intensive inpatient setting (American Society of Addiction Medicine level 3.7) in providing appropriate monitoring and treatment during and after a microdosing transition.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^1116kWt6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for opioid use disorder are medications, methadone (a full opioid agonist), or buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist), in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. Both treatments are effective but safety, efficacy, and patient preference can lead to a decision to change from one treatment to the other. Transfer from buprenorphine to methadone is not clinically challenging; however, changing from methadone to buprenorphine is more complex. Published reports describe varied approaches to manage this transfer to both minimize patient symptoms associated with withdrawal from methadone and reduce risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms with introduction of the partial agonist buprenorphine [Lintzeris et al. J Addict Med. 2020; in press]. There is no single approach for methadone to buprenorphine that is superior to others and no approach that is suitable for all case presentations. This case conference describes three different approaches to achieve a successful methadone to buprenorphine transfer and provides commentary on how the case may be managed based on published transfer "strategies".

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112qCsSu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM 2020 guideline — Criminal justice system psychosocial care, transitions, reentry planning, and naloxone: Individuals in the criminal justice system who have opioid use disorder or who are experiencing opioid withdrawal should be offered a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment based on an assessment of their individual psychosocial needs, and a patient's decision to decline or the absence of psychosocial treatment should not preclude oral daily pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder with appropriate medication management; motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. If an OTP is not accessible, providers may need to transition individuals from methadone to buprenorphine, a process that can be challenging but can be achieved safely if managed by a provider experienced in the procedure. Risk for relapse and overdose is particularly high in the weeks immediately following release from prison and jails; patients should be stabilized on pharmacotherapy and continue in treatment after release, with continuity individualized and coordinated with treatment providers in the community. Naloxone kits should be available within correctional facilities, individuals with opioid use disorder should receive a naloxone kit prior to release, and individuals and families should be educated in how to administer naloxone.

### Rapid transition to buprenorphine in a patient with methadone-related QTc interval prolongation [^117QG6U4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are managed on methadone often require transition to buprenorphine therapy. Current recommendations require months to gradually taper off of methadone; however, in some cases, the need to transition is urgent. Only a few rapid methadone-to-buprenorphine transitions have been reported and there are no established protocols to guide clinicians in these cases.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old man on 95 mg methadone for opioid use disorder experienced cardiac arrest attributable to ventricular fibrillation caused by QTc interval prolongation from methadone. In the hospital, a gradual taper of methadone was initiated but proved intolerable; the patient requested to restart his home dose of methadone and leave against medical advice. A rapid transition was initiated instead. Naltrexone (25 mg) was used to precipitate acute withdrawal followed 1 hour later by a "rescue" with buprenorphine/naloxone (16 mg/4 mg). The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Score (COWS) peaked at 21 post-naltrexone and fell quickly to 15 within a half-hour of buprenorphine/naloxone administration. The patient was maintained on a total daily dose of 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone through the time of discharge.

Conclusions

A patient requiring an urgent taper off of methadone due to adverse cardiac effects successfully transitioned to buprenorphine/naloxone within 2 hours by using naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal followed by a "rescue" with buprenorphine/naloxone. A relatively high dose of 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone successfully arrested withdrawal symptoms. With further refinement, this protocol may be an important technique for urgent methadone-to-buprenorphine transitions in the inpatient setting.

### Low-dose buprenorphine initiation in hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder: a retrospective cohort analysis [^117VARnG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) can initiate buprenorphine without requiring a withdrawal period through a low-dose (sometimes referred to as "micro-induction") approach. Although there is growing interest in low-dose buprenorphine initiation, current evidence is limited to case reports and small case series.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD seen by a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service who underwent low-dose buprenorphine initiation starting during hospital admission. We then integrated our practice-based experiences with results from the existing literature to create practice considerations.

Results

Sixty-eight individuals underwent 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations between July 2019 and July 2020. Reasons for low-dose versus standard buprenorphine initiation included co-occurring pain (91.7%), patient anxiety around the possibility of withdrawal (69.4%), history of precipitated withdrawal (9.7%), opioid withdrawal intolerance (6.9%), and other reason/not specified (18.1%). Of the 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations, 50 (69.4%) were completed in the hospital, 9 (12.5%) transitioned to complete as an outpatient, and 13 (18.1%) were terminated early. We apply our experiences and findings from literature to recommendations for varied clinical scenarios, including acute illness, co-occurring pain, opioid withdrawal intolerance, transition from high dose methadone to buprenorphine, history of precipitated withdrawal, and rapid hospital discharge. We share a standard low-dose initiation protocol with potential modifications based on above scenarios.

Conclusions

Low-dose buprenorphine initiation offers a well-tolerated and versatile approach for hospitalized patients with OUD. We share lessons from our experiences and the literature, and provide practical considerations for providers.

2.8 Discontinuing Treatment

The decision to discontinue therapy with SUBOXONE sublingual film after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication‐assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.9 Switching Between Buprenorphine or Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and SUBOXONE Sublingual Film

Patients being switched between buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine only sublingual tablets and SUBOXONE sublingual film should be started on the same dosage of the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between buprenorphine products. Not all strengths and combinations of the SUBOXONE sublingual films are bioequivalent to SUBOXONE® sublingual tablets as observed in pharmacokinetic studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different when patients are switched from tablets to film or vice‐versa. Patients should be monitored for symptoms related to over‐dosing or under‐dosing.

2.10 Switching Between SUBOXONE Sublingual Film Strengths

As indicated in Table 1, the sizes and the compositions of the four units of SUBOXONE sublingual films, i.e., 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg and the 12 mg/3 mg units, are different from one another. If patients switch between various combinations of lower and higher strength units of SUBOXONE sublingual films to obtain the same total dose, (e.g., from three 4 mg/1 mg units to a single 12 mg/3 mg unit, or vice‐versa), systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different and patients should be monitored for over‐dosing or under‐dosing. For this reason, pharmacist should not substitute one or more film strengths for another without approval of the prescriber.

2.11 Switching Between Sublingual and Buccal Sites of Administration

The systemic exposure of buprenorphine between buccal and sublingual administration of SUBOXONE sublingual film is similar. Therefore, once induction is complete, patients can switch between buccal and sublingual administration without significant risk of under or overdosing.

Objectives

Alternative transition protocols from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal and opioid use during induction.

Methods

Case report (n = 1).

Results

One patient with OUD underwent a rapid microinduction outpatient protocol that did not cause precipitated withdrawal or require preceding taper before cessation of methadone. The induction was carried out safely in the outpatient setting.

Conclusions

This report provides a patient-centered approach demonstrating feasibility and cost-effectiveness of rapid transition to buprenorphine in the US outpatient psychiatry setting. Barriers to adherence to opioid agonist therapy may be reduced using this protocol.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1166utnQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Formulations of buprenorphine: Recommendations using the term buprenorphine refer to both the buprenorphine only (monoproduct) and the combination buprenorphine/naloxone formulations, and the guideline generally recommends using combination buprenorphine/naloxone for both withdrawal management and treatment of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine/naloxone products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for initiation in patients physically dependent on long-acting opioid products; for this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy may be considered in patients taking long-acting opioids, with possible transition later to an extended-release or combination formulation. Approved formulations include extended-release injections, an extended-release subdermal implant, and generic versions of sublingual and buccal tablets and films, and clinicians should use the new injectable products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available.

### Transitioning a patient from injectable opioid agonist therapy to sublingual buprenorphine / naloxone for the treatment of opioid use disorder using a microdosing approach [^114to7Zk]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

In the wake of North America's opioid crisis, access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is of critical importance. While buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone are currently indicated as first-line medications for the treatment of OUD, there are a proportion of individuals who do not benefit from these therapies. Recent Canadian guidelines suggest the use of alternate therapies, including slow-release oral morphine or injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) for individuals unsuccessful with either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. While the guidelines highlight the need to intensify OUD treatment as disease severity increases, equally important is the consideration for deintensification of treatment (eg, from iOAT to an oral opioid agonist treatment (OAT) option) following successful stabilisation. Literature addressing how best to accomplish this, however, is currently lacking. Accordingly, the case presented here describes a patient that successfully transitions from iOAT to oral buprenorphine/naloxone using a novel induction approach termed microdosing.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^113HXtSo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine Dose Stabilization

The weighted mean stable buprenorphine dose was 14 mg per day. The difference between the initial buprenorphine dose on day 1 and the stable dose ranged from 0.0 to 31.2 mg, with a crude mean of 11.7 mg. The difference between the total dose on the first day and the stable dose ranged from 0.0 to 28.8 mg with a crude mean of 6 mg.

Individual studies' progression from the first buprenorphine dose to stabilization varied widely (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-3). For example, a stable dose of buprenorphine was reached in a single day in some studies. Other studies used various fixed, multiple-day schedules that were designed to reach target doses anywhere between 8 mg and 32 mg over 2 to 7 days.,

In 3 studies, buprenorphine dosing was determined by the patient's response to the previous buprenorphine doses.

A single study used transdermal buprenorphine for the transition. The remaining studies were vague in their descriptions of the stabilization process.,

The microdosing procedure used in the case series is described in detail in Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2. Briefly, the intended process was to administer the patient's full dose of methadone for 7 days concurrently with an increasing dose of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone. The protocol used in the case series was intended to begin with a single 0.5-mg dose once on the first day and then escalate to an 8-mg dose the following morning and a 4-mg dose in the evening on day 7 (which was also the last day of methadone — still at the full dose). On day 8, the patient began taking a single daily 12-mg dose of buprenorphine. Two of 3 patients whose outcomes were described in the case series ultimately deviated from the treatment protocol (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

Limited research compares these medications in prisons; a 2009 trial found no post-release differences between buprenorphine and methadone groups across self-reported relapse to illicit opioid use, rearrests, severity of crime, or reincarceration, and a 2019 systematic review found buprenorphine was as effective as methadone in reducing illicit opioid use post-release.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112HXuNY]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone transition to methadone or buprenorphine — indications, process, and safety are outlined as follows: Transitioning from naltrexone to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change medications and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transfer of medications should be planned, considered, and monitored, and transitioning from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment. Patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids and thus the initial doses of methadone or buprenorphine should be low, with clinicians discussing potential sedation, impairment, and fatigue and carefully monitoring these symptoms during initiation and titration. Patients should not be transitioned until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, which varies but is typically about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients who discontinue naltrexone treatment should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, and treatment alternatives including methadone and buprenorphine, as well as overdose prevention with naloxone, should be discussed.

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long‐ or short‐acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short‐acting opioid products

Patients dependent on heroin or other short‐acting opioid products may be inducted with either SUBOXONE sublingual film or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of SUBOXONE sublingual film should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too‐gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop‐out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 8 mg/2 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2‐hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.

On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg/4 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended.

Because the exposure to naloxone is somewhat higher after buccal than after sublingual administration, it is recommended that the sublingual site of administration be used during induction to minimize exposure to naloxone, to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Patients dependent on methadone or long‐acting opioid products

Patients dependent upon methadone or long‐acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short‐acting opioid products.

Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well‐controlled studies for induction in patients who are physically dependent on long‐acting opioid products, and the naloxone in these combination products is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precipitated and prolonged withdrawal. For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long‐acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions. Following induction, the patient may then be transitioned to once‐daily SUBOXONE sublingual film.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^117Gt3sx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Progression

Several approaches have been described for management of transfer from methadone to buprenorphine, which were discussed with the patient. The following sections provide alternative scenarios for progression of this case, based on these different treatment approaches. For 2 methods being discussed, tapering and higher dose transfers, there is a requirement for the patient to present in a state of withdrawal. As part of the pretransition discussions for these methods, the importance of presenting in moderate withdrawal is key to the successful transfer, as well as awareness of the possibility of slight worsening of withdrawal symptoms as the patient's buprenorphine is rapidly titrated.

Taper and Inpatient Transfer

This approach is in line with the NSW Clinical Guidelines for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, which have been drawn from the Australian National Guidelines for Medically Assisted Treatment of Opioid Dependence. In Australia, the opioid agonist treatment for OUD is run through a permit system, which is regulated by the State Health Departments, and it is illegal to prescribe these medications in an outpatient setting without an authority.

Given the dose of methadone that this patient is prescribed, the most suitable setting in which to conduct the transfer would be an inpatient setting. As discussed, preparation of the patient is key to a successful transference, especially with regard to the risk of precipitated withdrawal and the need for the patient to be in moderate withdrawal before commencing sublingual buprenorphine. Often, it is necessary for the patient to miss a dose of methadone before presenting for admission to allow enough time for the patient to develop sufficient withdrawal before buprenorphine is initiated. The patient must be cognizant of each step of the process including what happens after discharge.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients Dependent on Heroin or Other Short-acting Opioid Products:

At treatment initiation, the first dose of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should be administered only when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and not less than 4 hours after the patient last used an opioid.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. The dosing on the initial day of treatment may be given in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3–4 days, depending on the target dose.

Patients Dependent on Methadone or Other Long-acting Opioid Products:

Patients dependent upon methadone or other long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products; therefore, the first dose of Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets should only be administered when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and generally not less than 24 hours after the patient last used a long-acting opioid product.

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (> 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose.

Transitioning between treatment medications — indications and planning include side effects, unmet goals, or patient preference, with careful monitoring during transfers. Transition "may be appropriate in the following cases: 1. patient experiences intolerable medication side effects; 2. patient has not been successful in attaining or maintaining their treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy 3. patient wants to change and is a candidate for the alternative treatment". "Medication transitions should be planned, considered, and monitored". "Particular care should be taken in reducing methadone dosing before transfer to avoid precipitating a relapse", and "If the patient becomes unstable and appears at risk for relapse during the transfer of medications, restarting methadone may be the best option".

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products:

At treatment initiation, the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets should be administered only when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and not less than 4 hours after the patient last used an opioid.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. The dosing on the initial day of treatment may be given in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine sublingual tablets on Day 1 and 16 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet or buprenorphine sublingual tablets at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose.

Patients dependent on methadone or other long-acting opioid products:

Patients dependent upon methadone or other long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products; therefore, the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets should only be administered when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and generally not less than 24 hours after the patient last used a long-acting opioid product.

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (greater than 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111AwmLy]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians are strongly encouraged to provide medication treatment for their patients with opioid use disorder. Those unable to provide treatment themselves should arrange for patients with opioid use disorder to receive care from a colleague who is able to provide treatment, from a substance use disorder treatment specialist (e.g. an office-based buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment clinician), or from an opioid treatment program certified by SAMHSA to provide methadone or buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder. Resources to help clinicians arrange for treatment include SAMHSA's buprenorphine physician locator and SAMHSA's Opioid Treatment Program Directory. Clinicians should assist patients in finding qualified treatment specialists, should arrange for patients to follow up with these specialists, and should coordinate continuing care with these specialists. Rapidly identifying appropriate care can be challenging. Treatment need in a community is often not met by capacity to provide buprenorphine or methadone therapy. Clinicians prescribing opioids in communities without sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use disorder should obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. SAMHSA's Providers Clinical Support System offers training, technical assistance, and mentors to assist clinicians in assessment for and treatment of substance use disorders, specifically opioid use disorder, and on the interface of pain and opioid misuse. Clinicians prescribing opioids should identify treatment resources for substance use disorders including opioid use disorders in the community, establish a network of referral options that span the levels of care that patients might need to enable rapid collaboration and referral, when needed, and work together to ensure sufficient treatment capacity at the practice level.

Management of Opioid Misuse That Does Not Meet Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder

Clinicians can have challenges distinguishing between opioid misuse behaviors without opioid use disorder and mild or moderate opioid use disorder. For patients with opioid misuse that does not meet criteria for opioid use disorder (e.g. taking opioids in larger amounts than intended without meeting other criteria for opioid use disorder), clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, ensure that therapies for pain management have been optimized (see Recommendation 2), discuss with patients, and carefully weigh benefits and risks of continuing opioids at the current dosage (see Recommendation 5). For patients who choose to but are unable to taper, clinicians can reassess for opioid use disorder and offer buprenorphine treatment or refer for buprenorphine or methadone treatment if criteria for opioid use disorder are met. Even without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, transitioning to buprenorphine for pain also can be considered because of reduced risk for overdose with buprenorphine compared with risk associated with full agonist opioids (see Recommendation 5).

2.6 Clinical Supervision

Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. SUBOXONE sublingual film is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take‐home medication.

Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow‐up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.

Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow‐up visits may be appropriate. A once‐monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare provider's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:

Absence of medication toxicity.
Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects.
Responsible handling of medications by the patient.
Patient's compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery‐oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities).
Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use).

If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re‐evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.

2.7 Unstable Patients

Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^115tmhun]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Psychosocial treatment should be implemented in conjunction with the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder. This therapy may be provided by the prescribing clinician or by a separate therapist depending on the clinical situation and the skills and training of the prescribing clinician.

Clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion. Recommended strategies include frequent office visits (weekly in early treatment), urine drug testing, including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for pill counts.

Patients should be tested frequently for buprenorphine, other substances, and prescription medications. Accessing Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data may be useful for monitoring other medications that the patient may be receiving. Due to the variation in state PDMP laws, clinicians are encouraged to be familiar with the legal requirements associated with PDMPs and prescribing of controlled substances in their state.

Patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of their treatment. Weekly visits (at least) are recommended until patients are determined to be stable. There is no recommended time limit for treatment.

Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process, indefinite in duration, and close monitoring should be done even after buprenorphine is stopped. Buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months. Patients should be encouraged to remain in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of discontinuation. When considering a switch from buprenorphine to naltrexone, 7–14 days should elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before starting naltrexone. It may be useful to conduct a naloxone challenge before starting naltrexone to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence.

When considering a switch from buprenorphine to methadone, there is no required time delay because the addition of a full mu-opioid agonist to a partial agonist does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy and resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with an opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^11561Pdu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone — psychosocial care, relapse management, and transitions state that patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on individual needs, in conjunction with methadone, and that a patient's decision to decline or the absence of psychosocial treatment should not preclude methadone treatment. For patients who previously received methadone, it should be reinstituted immediately if relapse occurs or if an assessment determines that the risk of relapse is high (unless contraindicated), with re‑initiation following the recommendations on initial dose and titration. Transitioning from methadone to another medication may be appropriate if dangerous or intolerable side effects occur or if treatment goals are not met, and patients transitioning to buprenorphine should ideally be on low doses of methadone, with low-dose patients (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerating transition with minimal discomfort while higher-dose patients may experience significant discomfort. Patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before receiving naltrexone. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with methadone.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^113DumxH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The patient's methadone dose is withheld the day before and on the day of his admission. On admission day, it is important to reassess the patient's recent substance use, as this may affect your management. Once admitted, the patient's withdrawal severity is assessed regularly, every 4 hours, using a validated assessment instrument such as the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). Once he is in moderate withdrawal, which correlates to a score of ≥ 13 on the COWS, and he is observed to have objective signs of withdrawal such as dilated pupils and tachycardia, a test dose of 2 mg of sublingual buprenorphine is given. The patient is observed for precipitated withdrawal and other adverse events and reassessed using the COWS after 1 hour. If there have been no adverse events, a further 6 mg of sublingual buprenorphine is given. Withdrawal severity assessment continues every 2 hours and supplemental doses of 2 to 8 mg are administered depending on the severity of the withdrawal until such a time as the majority of the opioid withdrawal symptoms have abated and the patient is not sedated. The maximum daily dose of sublingual buprenorphine in Australia is 32 mg.

The admission can be used opportunistically to address other health problems and complete investigations such as blood borne virus screening and organize referrals as appropriate.

The patient is discharged 24 hours after the first dose of buprenorphine to the care of their community prescriber and last dosing details are provided to ensure that the prescriber is able to write a prescription and that there is no disruption to treatment. It is best practice that the prescriber reviews the patient as soon as is practical after discharge, ideally within the first 4 days. The prescriber is then able to adjust the dose according to clinical need.

### Discontinuing methadone and buprenorphine: a review and clinical challenges [^114pzZkA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This paper offers a review and recommendations for clinicians working with patients interested in discontinuing opioid agonist treatment. As buprenorphine/naloxone has gained widespread acceptance for opioid addiction, many treatment providers and patients have a range of hopes and expectations about its optimal use. A surprising number assume buprenorphine/naloxone is primarily useful as a medication to transition off illicit opioid use, and success is partially defined by discontinuing the medication. Despite accumulating evidence that a majority of patients will need to remain on medication to preserve their gains, clinicians often have to address a patient's fervent desire to taper. Using the concept of "recovery capital", our review addresses (1) the appropriate duration of opioid agonist treatment, (2) risks associated with discontinuing, (3) a checklist that guides the patient through self-assessment of the wisdom of discontinuing opioid agonist treatment, and (4) shared decision making about how to proceed.

### Buprenorphine / naloxone vs methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder [^112xGDGd]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Previous studies on the comparative effectiveness between buprenorphine and methadone provided limited evidence on differences in treatment effects across key subgroups and were drawn from populations who use primarily heroin or prescription opioids, although fentanyl use is increasing across North America.

Objective

To assess the risk of treatment discontinuation and mortality among individuals receiving buprenorphine/naloxone vs methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based retrospective cohort study using linked health administrative databases in British Columbia, Canada. The study included treatment recipients between January 1, 2010, and March 17, 2020, who were 18 years or older and not incarcerated, pregnant, or receiving palliative cancer care at initiation.

Exposures

Receipt of buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone among incident (first-time) users and prevalent new users (including first and subsequent treatment attempts).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% compatibility (confidence) intervals were estimated for treatment discontinuation (lasting ≥ 5 days for methadone and ≥ 6 days for buprenorphine/naloxone) and all-cause mortality within 24 months using discrete-time survival models for comparisons of medications as assigned at initiation regardless of treatment adherence ("initiator") and received according to dosing guidelines (approximating per-protocol analysis).

Results

A total of 30 891 incident users (39% receiving buprenorphine/naloxone; 66% male; median age, 33 [25th-75th, 26–43] years) were included in the initiator analysis and 25 614 in the per-protocol analysis. Incident users of buprenorphine/naloxone had a higher risk of treatment discontinuation compared with methadone in initiator analyses (88.8% vs 81.5% discontinued at 24 months; adjusted HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.53–1.63]), with limited change in estimates when evaluated at optimal dose in per-protocol analysis (42.1% vs 30.7%; adjusted HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.58–1.76]). Per-protocol analyses of mortality while receiving treatment exhibited ambiguous results among incident users (0.08% vs 0.13% mortality at 24 months; adjusted HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.24–1.35]) and among prevalent users (0.08% vs 0.09%; adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.54–1.73]). Results were consistent after the introduction of fentanyl and across patient subgroups and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

Receipt of methadone was associated with a lower risk of treatment discontinuation compared with buprenorphine/naloxone. The risk of mortality while receiving treatment was similar for buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone, although the CI estimate for the hazard ratio was wide.

RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS

While this Practice Guideline is intended to guide the assessment, treatment, and use of medications in opioid use disorder, there are areas where there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation. Further research is needed to compare the advantages of different medications for different patient groups, especially with the emergence of new treatments. The recommended areas of future research are outlined below and presented in the order they were introduced in the guideline.

Assessment and Diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder (Part 1)

More research is needed on best practices for drug testing during the initial evaluation and throughout the entire treatment process.

Further research is needed on evidence-based approaches for treating opioid use disorder in patients who continue to use marijuana and/or other psychoactive substances.

Although research indicates that offering tobacco cessation is a standard for all medical care, more research is needed before specific evidence-based recommendations can be made.

Treatment Options (Part 2)

More research is needed to compare the advantages of agonists and antagonists in the treatment of opioid use disorder. Although methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone are all superior to no treatment in opioid use disorder, less is known about their relative advantages.

Opioid Withdrawal Management (Part 3)

Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alpha-2 adrenergic and other nonopioid medications that are being used off-label for withdrawal management. These nonopioid medications may have use in transitioning patients onto antagonists for relapse prevention.

Further study is needed on other methods to accelerate the withdrawal process and facilitate the introduction of antagonists.

More research is needed to make recommendations on the optimal duration of a buprenorphine taper.

More research is needed to evaluate the safety of inpatient as compared to outpatient withdrawal management.

More research is needed to compare the effectiveness of short versus long tapers with buprenorphine withdrawal management.

Methadone (Part 4)

Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of added psychosocial treatment to treatment with methadone in OTP or inpatient settings. Treatment with methadone generally includes some psychosocial components. However, it is unclear whether added psychosocial treatment improves patient outcomes.

Research is needed to evaluate the use of ECG in treatment with methadone in preventing adverse events.

Buprenorphine (Part 5)

Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine induction conducted in the patient's own home, although some studies support this practice in select cases.

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products may be inducted with either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too-gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2-hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.

On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is recommended.

Because the exposure to naloxone is somewhat higher after buccal than after sublingual administration, it is recommended that the sublingual site of administration be used during induction to minimize exposure to naloxone, to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products

Patients dependent upon methadone or long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products.

Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for induction in patients who are physically dependent on long-acting opioid products, and the naloxone in these combination products is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precipitated and prolonged withdrawal. For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long-acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions. Following induction, the patient may then be transitioned to once-daily buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film.

### Transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine: the feasibility and evaluation of practice guidelines [^116saQnU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The most recent Australian Medication Assisted Treatment of Opioid Dependence (MATOD) clinical guidelines make a series of evidence-informed recommendations regarding transfers, the key features of which are summarized in Table 1. The more comprehensive national MATOD guidelines are included in Appendix 1. The Australian guidelines make broadly similar recommendations to even more recent American Society Addiction Medicine Guidance (ASAM;).

TABLE 1
Overview of Clinical Guidelines for Transferring From Methadone to Buprenorphine

This project aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing MATOD guidance regarding methadone to buprenorphine transfer in a number of specialist addiction treatment settings, and to examine patient outcomes associated with transfer attempts. Specifically, the project examined how transfers were conducted, and whether clinicians were able to adhere to key aspects of the guidance (feasibility); and patient outcomes and experiences with the transfer — specifically, did adverse outcomes occur during the transfer period (eg, precipitated withdrawal, treatment dropout), and were there any significant changes for patients on buprenorphine after transferring from methadone, including side effects, substance use, health, and psychosocial outcomes.

We recommend that if a maximal dose of buprenorphine is reached, an additional long-acting potent opioid such as fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone should be tried (strong, low). If usual doses of an additional opioid are ineffective for improving chronic pain, we recommend a closely monitored trial of higher doses of an additional opioid (strong, moderate); Buprenorphine's high binding affinity for the μ-opioid receptor may prevent the lower doses of other opioids from accessing the μ-opioid receptor. For patients on buprenorphine maintenance with inadequate analgesia despite the above-mentioned strategies, we recommend transitioning the patient from buprenorphine to methadone maintenance (strong, very low).

The main advantage of the microdosing method is that the patient should only experience mild withdrawal symptoms at worst (if any) from any previous prescribed daily dose of methadone, although the negative is that the process takes a number of weeks to complete, but by the end, the patient should be on a stable daily dose of buprenorphine and no longer be on any methadone, providing a crossover in opioid agonist treatment.

The guidance developed locally for this method is to commence with sublingual 400 μg buprenorphine and gradually increase this dose every 24 hours initially by 400 μg, then as the dose has increased, increasing the dose increment at a greater rate (eg, 800 μg after dose reaches 3 mg, 1200 μg after dose reaches 8 mg, etc), whilst maintaining the methadone dose. Once the buprenorphine dose is over 12 mg, consideration to reducing the daily methadone dose can be made, up to 50%. Then as the buprenorphine increases further and the patient stabilizes on the dose, the methadone can be quickly reduced with few withdrawal symptoms expected, as the buprenorphine is occupying the majority of the receptor sites. The process can take 3 to 4 weeks to complete, but this is dependent on the individual patient and the rate of buprenorphine increase.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113bmEaL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine — dosing, timing, and withdrawal thresholds specify that lower methadone doses transition more comfortably, initiation should occur in withdrawal, and specific buprenorphine doses are outlined. "Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort; whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may find that transitioning causes significant discomfort". "To minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal, it is recommended that clinicians use careful initial dosing followed by rapid titration up to an appropriate maintenance dose". "Patients should be experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the transition. This would typically occur up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone", and "A COWS score of 11–12 or more is generally sufficient for significant withdrawal to allow a safe and comfortable initiation onto buprenorphine". "An initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine should be given… [and] additional 2–8 mg doses as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms".

DISCUSSION

The ability to transition from methadone to buprenorphine medication has long been a challenge given the pharmacology of the 2 opioids. In some countries (eg, USA), methadone and buprenorphine are delivered in different treatment sectors, such that relatively few patients seek to make the transition. Elsewhere (eg, UK, Australia, and Europe), methadone and buprenorphine are routinely provided by the same service providers, and there seems to be greater experience in attempting transfers. Additionally, the treatment process and available resources in each country or state may differ (eg, access to inpatient facilities) and will be dependent on practices, facilities and product availabilities, but the reviewand this case study series are based on evidenced and peer reviewed articles and the clinical experience of the authors.

In 2020, 2 factors have highlighted the need for "smoother" transitions between the 2 medications. The introduction of depot buprenorphine medications – in many countries, with once-a-week or once-a-month dosing greatly increases treatment convenience and satisfaction and is likely to result in many patients seeking to transition from methadone to depot products. The second factor has been the emergence of COVID-19, and the need to minimize direct contact of patients attending and congregating at services. The greater safety profile of buprenorphine compared to methadone makes it a medication better suited to large numbers of unsupervised doses. Again, the depot formulations have also been encouraged in many services to reduce COVID-19 risks.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^112SNomw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine-based management of chronic pain in persons living with HIV who are on buprenorphine for opioid use disorder includes adjuvants, dose adjustments, formulation changes, and escalation strategies: Clinicians should use adjuvant therapy appropriate to the pain syndrome for mild-to-moderate breakthrough pain, and based on expert opinion the clinician should increase the dosage of buprenorphine in divided doses as an initial step, with dosing ranges of 4–16 mg divided into 8-hour doses noted as having shown benefit. Based on expert opinion, clinicians might switch from buprenorphine/naloxone to buprenorphine transdermal formulation alone. If a maximal dose of buprenorphine is reached, it is recommended that an additional long-acting potent opioid such as fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone should be tried, and if usual doses of an additional opioid are ineffective, a closely monitored trial of higher doses of an additional opioid is recommended, noting that buprenorphine's high binding affinity for the µ-opioid receptor may prevent lower doses of other opioids from accessing the µ-opioid receptor. For patients on buprenorphine maintenance with inadequate analgesia despite these strategies, transitioning the patient from buprenorphine to methadone maintenance is recommended.

### Enhancing patient choice: using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^1162VFL9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

More than 100,000 overdose deaths were reported in 2021, largely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and, like methadone, reduces morbidity and mortality while increasing retention in care. Unfortunately, initiating BUP-NX has become more complicated as IMF has largely replaced heroin in the US drug supply.

Buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist, has high affinity and low intrinsic activation at the μ-opioid receptor. Because of these properties, buprenorphine can cause precipitated withdrawal if taken too soon or at a wrong dose after full agonist opioid. Unfortunately, this precipitation risk increases with regular fentanyl use — likely because of fentanyl's lipophilicity, which leads to a large volume of distribution and slow dissipation when used chronically. Patients have significant concerns about the severity of withdrawal needed to start buprenorphine as well as the risk of precipitated withdrawal; the possibility of a negative experience understandably fosters hesitance to begin treatment. –

Newer methods for BUP-NX initiation have been reported — generally categorized as very low- (or "microdosing"), low-, standard-, and high-dose (or "macrodose") protocols — each with potential benefits and risks (Table 1). Less common methods use transdermal, buccal sublingual, and intravenous buprenorphine formulations not readily available for this outpatient purpose. Additional effective, expedited approaches would empower patients, providing more choices regarding when and how quickly they can fully transition to lifesaving treatment.

Methods for Transitioning From Full Agonists to Buprenorphine Using Readily Available Outpatient Formulations*

We present a novel approach for rapid outpatient BUP-NX initiation where a patient chose self-administration of intranasal naloxone to induce withdrawal, followed shortly by 24–6 mg BUP-NX. The patient provided written informed consent for publication, including review of the article.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to methadone (PEER), CFPC 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that methadone might be superior over buprenorphine-naloxone for retention in treatment, however, the latter might be easier to implement in practice owing to fewer prescribing restrictions and considerations.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^1145fnjH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

To review the currently available evidence on transfer strategies from methadone to sublingual buprenorphine used in clinical trials and observational studies of medication for opioid use disorder treatment, and to consider whether any strategies yield better clinical outcomes than others.

Methods:

Six medical and public health databases were searched for articles and conference abstracts. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were used to identify unpublished trial results. Records were dually screened, and data were extracted and checked independently. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when possible, analyzed quantitatively.

Results:

Eighteen studies described transfer from methadone to buprenorphine. Transfer protocols were extremely varied. Most studies reported successful rates of transfer, even among studies involving transfer from high methadone doses, although lower pretransfer methadone dose was significantly associated with higher rate of successful transfer. Precipitated withdrawal was not reported frequently. A range of innovative approaches to transfer from methadone to buprenorphine remains untested.

Conclusions:

Few studies have used designs that enable comparison of different approaches to transfer patients from methadone to buprenorphine. Most international clinical guidelines provide recommendations consistent with the available evidence. However, clinical guidelines should be perceived as providing "guidance" rather than "protocols", and clinicians and patients need to exercise judgment when attempting transfers.
