## Question

Possible cause of tachycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the possible causes of tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define tachycardia and classify it by mechanism and QRS width. Then, I should verify the major etiologic buckets: physiologic/secondary, primary sinus tachycardias, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, and wide-complex tachycardias. Next, I will review key differentiators and red flags, followed by a prioritized diagnostic approach. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with caveats and special populations in mind.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor incorrectly. Tachycardia is generally a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, and I should distinguish sinus tachycardia from tachyarrhythmias, and narrow-complex (QRS < 120 ms) from wide-complex (QRS ≥ 120 ms) forms because this immediately changes urgency and management, with wide-complex tachycardias more often ventricular and potentially unstable [^50064fc9] [^1c62cc2c].

> I will now examine physiologic or secondary sinus tachycardia, since missing a reversible driver is common. Appropriate sinus tachycardia reflects increased sympathetic tone from exercise, pain, anxiety, fever, hypovolemia, anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, or stimulants, and it should resolve with correction of the cause; I should double-check that guidelines emphasize identifying and treating the underlying condition rather than suppressing the sinus rate itself [^203edaf7] [^81f252f8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "benign" sinus tachycardia. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a diagnosis of exclusion defined by resting sinus rate > 100 bpm with mean 24-hour rate > 90 bpm, symptoms, and no secondary cause; I need to ensure I exclude hyperthyroidism, anemia, dehydration, pain, and substances, and I should remember IST is often chronic and may respond poorly to beta-blockade, with ivabradine as a reasonable option for symptom control in selected patients [^8f383827] [^29319109] [^0603c54f].

> Next, I should review postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is frequently encountered in young women. POTS is defined by a heart rate increase of ≥ 30 bpm (≥ 40 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of standing without orthostatic hypotension, often with heart rate ≥ 120 bpm; I need to check for triggers like infection, trauma, surgery, or autoimmunity, and I should confirm that a 12-lead ECG and basic labs are recommended to exclude secondary causes before labeling POTS [^3dd8e589] [^39a6a7fa] [^d2836828].

> Let me consider supraventricular tachyarrhythmias next. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation are the principal SVTs; I should confirm that AVNRT and AVRT are reentrant and often regular, whereas AF is irregular, and I need to remember that SVTs can precipitate tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy if persistent or frequent, which is reversible with rate or rhythm control [^50064fc9] [^fd56317b] [^bea8657b].

> I should double-check the approach to wide-complex tachycardia because misclassification is dangerous. When in doubt, treat a regular wide-complex tachycardia as ventricular tachycardia (VT); adenosine may be considered in stable, monomorphic WCT to unmask SVT with aberrancy, but I need to ensure I do not delay electricity if unstable, and I should obtain a 12-lead ECG in tachycardia and in sinus rhythm to look for pre-excitation, ischemia, or conduction disease [^1c62cc2c] [^a6eed57b] [^df08cedf].

> But wait, what if the wide complex reflects a toxic-metabolic cause rather than VT or SVT with aberrancy. Electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicity, and ischemia can widen the QRS and mimic VT; I need to check potassium, magnesium, and acid-base status, review medications, and consider ischemia, especially if the clinical context fits, because treating the underlying metabolic derangement can correct the rhythm [^c3812e65] [^846d5b7b].

> I will now examine ventricular arrhythmias beyond VT. Frequent PVCs can cause PVC-induced cardiomyopathy when the burden is high, and sustained VT can acutely destabilize hemodynamics; I should confirm that ICDs are indicated for secondary prevention after sustained VT/VF or for primary prevention when ejection fraction and criteria meet guidelines, and I need to remember that catheter ablation is an important strategy for reducing arrhythmia burden and reversing cardiomyopathy in selected patients [^f29ab5af] [^ba188274] [^383267ab].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts so I don't miss nuances. In pregnancy and the peripartum period, persistent sinus tachycardia may reflect autonomic dysregulation and can be associated with adverse outcomes; I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for secondary causes and not dismiss symptoms as purely physiologic. In pediatrics, SVT is common and often due to accessory pathways, with age-specific diagnostic thresholds for POTS. And in COVID-19, tachycardia is frequent and may signal myocardial injury, so I should correlate with troponin and clinical status [^65344332] [^5479333e] [^a214bc44].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic approach so I don't overtest. Start with history, vitals including orthostatics, and a 12-lead ECG; add CBC, TSH, and basic chemistries to screen for anemia, hyperthyroidism, and electrolytes; use Holter or event monitoring if symptoms are intermittent; and reserve echocardiography for suspected structural disease, persistent tachycardia, or concern for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy; tilt testing is reasonable when POTS is suspected after initial screening [^580193c0] [^39a6a7fa] [^d2836828].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent action. Hemodynamic instability with hypotension, altered mentation, ischemic chest pain, or signs of shock requires immediate synchronized cardioversion if VT or unstable SVT is present; likewise, polymorphic VT or suspected torsades warrants prompt magnesium and correction of precipitants, and I should not delay definitive therapy while chasing a precise mechanism in unstable patients [^f029787f] [^a4a5ac5b].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Tachycardia arises from increased automaticity, triggered activity, or reentry, and the key is to classify by mechanism, QRS width, and presence of secondary causes; most sinus tachycardias are secondary and reversible, IST and POTS are primary autonomic disorders of exclusion, SVTs are reentrant or automatic and can cause cardiomyopathy if unchecked, and VT or other wide-complex rhythms carry the highest acute risk and should be managed aggressively when unstable [^50064fc9] [^fd56317b] [^1c62cc2c].

Tachycardia has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **sinus tachycardia from anxiety, pain, fever, dehydration, anemia, hyperthyroidism, or stimulants** [^203edaf7] [^81f252f8]. Other frequent etiologies include **atrial fibrillation/flutter, SVT, and ventricular tachycardia** [^50064fc9], often linked to structural heart disease, ischemia, or electrolyte disturbances [^383267ab]. Less common causes include POTS, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and drug or toxin effects [^1d1bb12a] [^8f383827]. Evaluation should start with a **12-lead ECG**, vital signs, and targeted labs (CBC, TSH, electrolytes, troponin) [^c72fcbdc] [^580193c0]; echocardiography and ambulatory monitoring are used when indicated [^39a6a7fa]. Management is cause-specific: treat underlying drivers, control rate/rhythm, and provide urgent cardioversion or defibrillation if unstable [^203edaf7] [^f029787f].

---

## Physiological causes

Physiological sinus tachycardia is an **appropriate increase in heart rate** in response to increased sympathetic tone or metabolic demand [^5e423a12]. Common triggers include:

- **Exercise**: Increased metabolic demand and sympathetic activation [^5e423a12].
- **Emotional stress/anxiety**: Heightened sympathetic tone [^8f383827].
- **Pain**: Sympathetic activation and catecholamine release [^notfound].
- **Fever/infection**: Increased metabolic rate and sympathetic response [^203edaf7].
- **Dehydration/hypovolemia**: Compensatory increase in heart rate to maintain cardiac output [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Increased circulatory demand and hormonal changes [^notfound].

## Pathological causes

### Cardiac arrhythmias

Cardiac arrhythmias are a **common cause of tachycardia** and include:

| **Arrhythmia type** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) | - Atrial fibrillation <br/> - Atrial flutter <br/> - AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) <br/> - Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome | - Reentry <br/> - Increased automaticity <br/> - Triggered activity [^4c66ecbe] |
| Ventricular tachycardias | - Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia <br/> - Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia <br/> - Torsades de pointes | - Reentry <br/> - Triggered activity <br/> - Automaticity [^c1b7e0ba] |

---

### Structural heart disease

Structural heart disease provides a substrate for arrhythmias and tachycardia via **myocardial scarring, ischemia, or hemodynamic stress**:

- **Coronary artery disease**: Ischemia-induced arrhythmias and sinus tachycardia from heart failure [^notfound].
- **Heart failure**: Compensatory sinus tachycardia and arrhythmias from ventricular remodeling [^8196d745].
- **Valvular heart disease**: Hemodynamic stress and arrhythmias (e.g. mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation) [^notfound].
- **Cardiomyopathies**: Dilated, hypertrophic, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) [^383267ab].

---

### Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances

Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances can precipitate tachyarrhythmias via **altered myocardial excitability**:

- **Hypokalemia/hyperkalemia**: Increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Hypomagnesemia**: Associated with torsades de pointes and other arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Acid-base disturbances**: Metabolic acidosis or alkalosis can precipitate arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Increased sympathetic tone and arrhythmias [^da3b3d1a].

---

### Autonomic dysfunction

Autonomic dysfunction causes **inappropriate sinus tachycardia** or orthostatic intolerance syndromes:

- **Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)**: Persistent elevated heart rate without identifiable secondary causes [^8f383827].
- **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: Excessive heart rate increase upon standing without hypotension [^3dd8e589].
- **Anxiety disorders**: Heightened sympathetic tone and hypervigilance [^8f383827].

---

### Medications and substances

Medications and substances can cause **tachycardia** through sympathetic stimulation or direct myocardial effects:

- **Stimulants**: Caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine [^203edaf7].
- **Beta-agonists**: Albuterol, salmeterol [^203edaf7].
- **Anticholinergics**: Atropine, scopolamine.
- **Illicit drugs**: Cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy (MDMA) [^203edaf7].
- **Withdrawal syndromes**: Alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids.

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential to identify the cause of tachycardia:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers, symptoms, medication use, substance use, family history [^580193c0].
- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, orthostatic measurements, cardiac exam, signs of systemic disease [^39a6a7fa].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: 12-lead ECG to identify rhythm, rate, and underlying conduction abnormalities [^c72fcbdc].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, thyroid function tests, electrolytes, troponin, drug levels [^580193c0].
- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate structural heart disease, ventricular function [^39a6a7fa].
- **Ambulatory monitoring**: Holter or event monitors for intermittent symptoms [^0334ea1a].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause and clinical stability**:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Correct dehydration, anemia, electrolyte disturbances, hyperthyroidism, or remove offending substances [^203edaf7].
- **Rate control**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmic medications [^notfound].
- **Rhythm control**: Antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation for persistent arrhythmias [^ba188274].
- **Urgent intervention**: Cardioversion or defibrillation for unstable patients [^b4d5b49b].

---

Tachycardia has diverse causes, including physiological responses, cardiac arrhythmias, structural heart disease, electrolyte disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and medications. A **structured evaluation** and cause-specific management are essential for optimal outcomes [^81f252f8].

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), the most common form of orthostatic intolerance in young people, affects approximately 500,000 people in the United States alone, typically young women at the peak of their education and the beginning of their working lives. This is a heterogeneous disorder, the pathophysiology and mechanisms of which are not well understood. There are multiple contributing factors and numerous potential mimics. This review details the most current views on the potential causes, comorbid conditions, proposed subtypes, differential diagnoses, evaluations, and treatment of POTS from cardiological and neurological perspectives.

### Sinus tachycardia: a multidisciplinary expert focused review [^81f252f8]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia (ST) is ubiquitous, but its presence outside of normal physiological triggers in otherwise healthy individuals remains a commonly encountered phenomenon in medical practice. In many cases, ST can be readily explained by a current medical condition that precipitates an increase in the sinus rate, but ST at rest without physiological triggers may also represent a spectrum of normal. In other cases, ST may not have an easily explainable cause but may represent serious underlying pathology and can be associated with intolerable symptoms. The classification of ST, consideration of possible etiologies, as well as the decisions of when and how to intervene can be difficult. ST can be classified as secondary to a specific, usually treatable, medical condition (eg, pulmonary embolism, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism) or be related to several incompletely defined conditions (eg, inappropriate ST, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder, or post-COVID syndrome). While cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists often evaluate patients with symptoms associated with persistent or paroxysmal ST, an optimal approach remains uncertain. Due to the many possible conditions associated with ST, and an overlap in medical specialists who see these patients, the inclusion of experts in different fields is essential for a more comprehensive understanding. This article is unique in that it was composed by international experts in Neurology, Psychology, Autonomic Medicine, Allergy and Immunology, Exercise Physiology, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Endocrinology, Cardiology, and Cardiac Electrophysiology in the hope that it will facilitate a more complete understanding and thereby result in the better care of patients with ST.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^c1b7e0ba]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. As straightforward as these mechanisms are, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying the ventricular tachycardia. Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, as well as recommending and timing ablative therapy all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia mechanism. The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiological sinus tachycardia — definition and causes: Sinus tachycardia is regarded as physiological when it is the result of appropriate autonomic influences, such as in the setting of physical activity or emotional responses. Physiological sinus tachycardia may result from pathological causes, including infection with fever, dehydration, anemia, heart failure, and hyperthyroidism, in addition to exogenous substances, including caffeine, drugs with a beta-agonist effect (eg, albuterol, salmeterol), and illicit stimulant drugs (eg, amphetamines, cocaine). In these cases, tachycardia is expected to resolve with correction of the underlying cause.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome – current experience and concepts [^88df2072]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. PoTS is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young (aged between 15 years and 40 years) and predominantly female. The symptoms — palpitations, dizziness and occasionally syncope — mainly occur when the patient is standing upright, and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, such as modest exertion, food ingestion and heat, are now recognized to be capable of exacerbating the symptoms. Onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery or stress. PoTS can be associated with various other disorders; in particular, joint hypermobility syndrome (also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This Review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS, and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, as well as current and investigational treatments.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: what's new? [^ba188274]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use. In this review, we discuss current state of the art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

### Removing the complexity from wide complex tachycardia [^3ed48667]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Correctly diagnosing the cause of wide QRS tachycardias remain an area of difficulty for many clinicians. The authors provide a concise update to the different ECG algorithms that have been developed as well as caveats in their application.

### Narrow complex tachycardias [^2d82e267]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Narrow-complex tachycardias are commonly seen on shift in the emergency department. Although a portion of patients present with hemodynamic instability because of arrhythmia, it is important to know that the tachycardia can be a result of an underlying condition. Rapid identification of the type and etiology of the arrhythmia is vital to directing appropriate management strategies and disposition decisions.

### The sinus tachycardias [^f4c035c0]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia, in the forms of four distinct rhythm disturbances, is frequently encountered in clinical practice but is often overlooked. The most common rhythm, normal sinus tachycardia, whether physiologic, pathologic or iatrogenic, is predominantly catecholamine driven, is virtually asymptomatic and is managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause. The other so-called primary sinus tachycardias, which include inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and sinus node re-entry tachycardia, have fundamentally different clinical features, basic underlying etiologic mechanisms and treatment strategies. Differentiation of these types from normal sinus tachycardia and from other atrial arrhythmias is crucial for successful management. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the sinus tachycardias not only prevents multiple consultations but might also have important long-term prognostic implications.

### Wide-complex tachycardia: beyond the traditional differential diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia vs supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction [^846d5b7b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) is defined as a rhythm disturbance with a rate greater than 100 beats/min and a QRS complex duration of 0.12 seconds or more in the adult patient; in the pediatric patient, both rate and QRS complex width are age related. In evaluating this type of tachycardia, there are 2 broad categories usually discussed in the medical literature: ventricular and supraventricular with aberrant intraventricular conduction. There are several other important causes of a WCT encountered in clinical practice, which are less often discussed; these tachycardias often require specific therapies differing from the standard approach to WCT. These tachycardias are diverse; as such, the pathophysiology behind each form of WCT includes toxic, metabolic, and conduction system dysfunction mechanisms.

### Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder? [^79b1705f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a rise in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from supine to standing position, has been traditionally viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that in addition to being considered a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, POTS should be viewed also as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder given (1) significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS; (2) structural and functional differences found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance; (3) evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume, and (4) positive response to medications targeting the CNS and non-pharmacologic CNS therapies. This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder can lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in patents affected by this disabling syndrome.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia definitions — physiologic versus inappropriate: sinus tachycardia is a rhythm arising from the sinus node in which the rate of impulses exceeds 100 bpm; physiologic sinus tachycardia is an appropriate increased sinus rate in response to exercise and other situations that increase sympathetic tone; inappropriate sinus tachycardia is defined by sinus heart rate > 100 bpm at rest with a mean 24-h heart rate > 90 bpm not due to appropriate physiological responses or primary causes such as hyperthyroidism or anemia.

### Approach to the diagnosis and initial management of the stable adult patient with a wide complex tachycardia [^94472ce5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiographic evaluation of every tachyarrhythmia should begin by addressing the question of whether the QRS complex is wide or narrow. The most important cause of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is ventricular tachycardia. However, supraventricular tachycardia can also manifest with a wide QRS complex. The ability to differentiate between supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS due to aberrancy or preexcitation and ventricular tachycardia often presents a diagnostic challenge. The identification of whether WCT has a ventricular or supraventricular origin is critical because the treatment for each is different, and improper therapy may have potentially lethal consequences. In conclusion, although the diagnosis and treatment of sustained WCT often arise in emergency situations, this report focuses on a stepwise approach to the management of WCT in relatively stable adult patients, particularly the diagnosis and differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex on standard 12-lead electrocardiography.

### Wide complex tachycardias [^428e7a9e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Wide complex tachycardias (WCT) are frequently encountered in the emergency department. Causes of WCT vary from benign (eg, supraventricular with rate-related aberrancy) to life threatening (eg, atrial fibrillation with WPW, or ventricular tachycardia). It is imperative that emergency physicians are familiar with the clinical presentation, underlying causes, and electrocardiographic features of the different causes of WCT. Treatment of WCT depends on patient stability, regularity of the rhythm, and QRS morphology. When in doubt, monomorphic WCT should be presumed to be ventricular tachycardia and treated as such.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^4c66ecbe]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on supraventricular tachyarrhythmias:

- **Definition**: Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are a group of heart rhythms that originate above the ventricles, typically in the atria or atrioventricular node.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias involves abnormal electrical conduction in the atria or atrioventricular node. This can be due to a variety of mechanisms, including reentry, increased automaticity, or triggered activity.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in the US is estimated at 229 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias include structural heart disease, such as congenital heart disease, and conditions that affect the heart's electrical system, such as electrolyte imbalances. Certain medications can also predispose to supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias can present with a range of symptoms, from palpitations and shortness of breath to syncope and HF, depending on the severity and duration of the arrhythmia. In certain patient populations, such as those with congenital heart disease or severe pulmonary hypertension, SVTs can lead to significant clinical deterioration.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias is generally good, especially if the underlying cause can be identified and treated. However, in some cases, such as sustained AF in patients with pulmonary hypertension, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias can be associated with a high risk of death from RV failure.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): a critical assessment [^76959261]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Although diagnostic criteria have been developed characterizing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), no single set of criteria is universally accepted. Furthermore, there are gaps in the present criteria used to identify individuals who have this condition. The reproducibility of the physiological findings, the relationship of symptoms to physiological findings, the presence of symptoms alone without any physiological findings and the response to various interventions confuse rather than clarify this condition. As many disease entities can be confused with POTS, it becomes critical to identify what this syndrome is. What appears to be POTS may be an underlying condition that requires specific therapy. POTS is not simply orthostatic intolerance and symptoms or intermittent orthostatic tachycardia but the syndrome needs to be characterized over time and with reproducibility. Here we address critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of POTS in an attempt to arrive at a rational approach to categorize the syndrome with the hope that it may help both better identify individuals and better understand approaches to therapy.

### Deciphering the sinus tachycardias [^d46400a5]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice. Primary sinus tachycardia without an underlying secondary cause, despite often being associated with troublesome symptoms, is often neglected leading to multiple consultations and frustration on part of both the practitioner and the patient. The fact that primary sinus tachycardias are a heterogeneous group of disorders is seldom appreciated; hence, a firm diagnosis is rarely reached and management is haphazard. Furthermore, there may be prognostic implications for prolonged or recurrent sinus tachycardia, making it imperative that this group of arrhythmias receive adequate and appropriate attention. Normal sinus tachycardia (i.e., secondary), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and sinus node reentry tachycardia make up this group of arrhythmias. Their definitions, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimum management are discussed in this review.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^8f383827]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) — definition, diagnostic features, distinctions, and management: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is defined as sinus tachycardia that is unexplained by physiological demands at rest, with minimal exertion, or during recovery from exercise and is associated with symptoms that include weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, and uncomfortable sensations, such as heart racing. Patients with IST commonly show resting heart rates > 100 bpm and average rates that are > 90 bpm in a 24-hour period. It is important to distinguish IST from secondary causes of tachycardia, including hyperthyroidism, anemia, dehydration, pain, and use of exogenous substances and drugs of abuse, and to exclude structural heart disease; anxiety is also an important trigger, and patients with IST may have associated anxiety disorders. IST must also be distinguished from other forms of tachycardia, including AT arising from the superior aspect of the crista terminalis and sinus node reentrant tachycardia; patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have predominant symptoms related to a change in posture, and treatment to suppress the sinus rate may lead to severe orthostatic hypotension. Thus, IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. There are no specific recommendations for acute treatment of IST, and because the prognosis of IST is generally benign, treatment is for symptom reduction and may not be necessary.

### Clinical significance of unexplained persistent sinus tachycardia in women with structurally normal heart during the peripartum period [^65344332]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is generally considered a benign arrhythmia, subsequently management recommendations are absent from newly published guidelines. Therefore, the question remains: if persistent sinus tachycardia is considered a benign occurrence, with the only intervention to the patient being reassurance, why do women with persistent ST of unclear etiology experience higher rates of c-sections Answering this question may be of vital significance as it may shorten then LOS but also prevent unnecessary C-sections which can be associated with short- and long-term effects for both mother and child.

In almost 70% of the patients in our cohort, the etiology of persistent ST could not be elucidated, and could be deemed as either inappropriate tachycardia or sinus tachycardia of unknown etiology. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia, defined by the 2015 HRS consensus as "sinus heart rate more than 100 bpm at rest with mean 24‐hour heart rate more than 90 bpm, in absence of secondary causes", has been shown to predominately affect young females. Shabtae et al. found pregnancy to be the most common precipitating factor for inappropriate ST. Dysregulation of the compensatory mechanisms to increase cardiac output, namely sympathetic and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activation create autonomic dysfunction, is a known etiology for inappropriate ST. Only small case series in the literature report women who experience inappropriate ST during the peripartum may be at risk for adverse maternal outcomes. Sharp et al. found an increased rate of induction of labor among the 19 patients they identified, although they did not find elevated rates of c-section in this study conducted in the England.

As shown in our study, sinus tachycardia cannot be explained solely by indolent infection or hypovolemia. Autonomic dysfunction, hormonal fluctuations, catecholamine surge, and medications have been proposed as explanations for sinus tachycardia of unknown etiology. Although clinicians must balance between extensive diagnostic investigation to determine the etiology of inappropriate ST and reassurance when it is a benign incident, reflecting physiologic changes, distinguishing between the two may have an impact on preventing adverse maternal outcomes. Further evidence is needed to understand the clinical significance and to deliver evidence-based care.

Through this analysis we emphasize the importance of not dismissing ST in the obstetric population and seek to raise awareness of its significance in predicating complications and poor maternal outcomes. ST is one of the earliest and most insidious signs of a poor prognosis, however it is frequently considered "physiologic", even in the absence of a clear etiology. ST could be a surrogate of underlying pathology leading to poor outcomes and should prompt further investigation in obstetric patients.

Conservative and medical treatment — general considerations — reducing the number of medications that cause hypotension can be helpful, provided that it does not worsen conditions such as hypertension and heart failure; several narrative and systematic reviews have evaluated the benefits of lifestyle and medical therapies, and while results have generally been positive in uncontrolled trials and short-term controlled trials, those of long-term, placebo-controlled prospective trials have been less encouraging; furthermore, only the most motivated patients will commit to medical therapy to prevent a handful of yearly syncopal episodes.

### Clinical implication of COVID-19 associated bradycardia [^0356776b]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kumar and colleagues performed a large‐scale multicenter retrospective study including more than 1000 COVID‐19 patients and found that bradycardia was prevalent and associated with higher mortality among them. Their findings are of great interest because infection and high fever are, in general, associated with tachycardia. Several concerns have been raised.

To further clarify the mechanism of COVID‐19 associated bradycardia, it is of great interest to investigate the type of bradycardia: sinus bradycardia, AV block, or atrial fibrillation. Noncardiac causes should be carefully excluded, including sedation, conduction‐suppressive medications, and hypothyroidism.

The causality between bradycardia and mortality remains unclear. Bradycardia might be a marker of the advanced stage of COVID‐19 or a direct cause of death. Bradycardia might be more prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 associated myocarditis with incremental troponin level. On the other hand, bradycardia might cause low cardiac output accompanying cardiogenic shock. If bradycardia is harmful, aggressive intervention to bradycardia, including pacemaker therapy, would be beneficial. In their study, was the dominant cause of death in patients with bradycardia respiratory failure or heart failure?

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

We present a patient who had a wide QRS tachycardia; it was initially difficult to determine whether it was superventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT). By some criteria (sinus capture beats, pseudo-δ waves and wide QRS) the patient's ECG was suggestive of VT of epicardial origin. On the coronary angiogram it was found that this patient had significant coronary artery disease. He was stented with three stents and later had a full electrophysiological study. We present here the ECGs and the differential diagnosis and a brief review of the diagnostic features of epicardial VT.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: etiology, pathophysiology, and Management: JACC review topic of the week [^29319109]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome that generally affects young patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Although the most common symptom is palpitations, it can be accompanied by a myriad of symptoms, including anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. The pathogenesis of IST is not well understood and considered multifactorial, with autonomic dysfunction being the central abnormality. IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. Management presents a clinical challenge. The overall efficacy of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy may be limited. Recent advances in catheter and surgical sinus node sparing ablation techniques have led to improvement in outcomes. In addition, increased focus has led to development of multimodality team-based interventions to improve outcomes in this group of patients. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic basis of IST, review current approaches to diagnosis, and outline contemporary therapeutic approaches.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^da8bf060]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and vasovagal syncope in the young — although the cornerstone for the diagnosis of pediatric POTS is the medical history, an orthostatic test is required to confirm the diagnosis, and the diagnostic standard for tilt-table testing for POTS in young people requires symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and an orthostatic increase in heart rate of at least 40 bpm; the 10-minute standing tests for POTS provided reasonable accuracy in a small study on adults, but these tests have not been validated for pediatric populations. Given that the medical history usually provides a clear diagnosis and that tilt testing has imperfect sensitivity and specificity in pediatric patients, such testing is usually not indicated, while an ECG is a simple and well-tolerated test to screen for relatively uncommon but dangerous causes. Prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring (external loop event monitor or an ILR) is reasonable if the clinical history suggests an inheritable arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy or severe bradycardia or if the patient is refractory to medical therapy, and a 24-hour Holter monitor can be performed to distinguish POTS from IST. Syncope during exercise usually raises concern about a rare cardiac electrical or structural cause, but the most common cause of exercise-related syncope in pediatric populations is still vasovagal syncope, and pseudosyncope should be suspected when patients present with very frequent (at least daily) or prolonged syncope.

### Postural hyperventilation as a cause of postural tachycardia syndrome: increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when upright in all postural tachycardia syndrome variants [^d6c9de65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Standing upright (orthostasis) translocates central blood volume (CBV) to the dependent body and can precipitate orthostatic intolerance (OI). Symptoms of OI generally begin within 5 minutes of orthostatic stress. OI is defined by signs, such as changes in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), or respiration; and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, headache, nausea, fatigue, cognitive deficits, and exercise intolerance starting while upright and relieved by recumbency. 1, 2 Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a common form of chronic OI, is associated with excess upright tachycardia in the absence of hypotension. 3, 4, 5

Dyspnea, hyperventilation, and hypocapnia have been reported in association with POTS and also in other forms of OI, including neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope. 6, 7, 8 Circulatory collapse 9 and milder perturbations, such as induction of hypotension in healthy volunteers, result in hyperventilation and hypocapnia. 10, 11 Hypotension and reduced cardiac output (CO) precedes hyperventilation in these OI variants and may act by causing ischemia of the carotid body ("stagnant hypoxia"), 12 in part related to sympathetic vasoconstriction of the artery to the carotid body. 13

Systemic hypotension, however, does not cause hyperventilation in POTS because, by definition, hypotension is absent in POTS. 3, 4, 5 Nevertheless, intermittent hyperventilation, presenting as postural hypocapnic hyperpnea, has been reported. 14, 15, 16, 17 We observed hypocapnic hyperpnea in POTS in response to a rapid initial orthostatic decrease in CO and CBV. 15 In contrast, hyperventilation has not been observed during past experiments using graded incremental upright tilt. 18

Hyperventilation produces sinus tachycardia, whereas resultant hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood flow, and results in symptoms and maladaptive effects, including impaired neuronal activation. 19 Hypocapnia can be eliminated or diminished by artificial CO₂ rebreathing or by adding CO₂ to inhaled gas sufficient to produce eucapnia while maintaining oxygen concentration constant. 20

We hypothesize that postural hyperventilation is a cause of POTS with normal CO supine, but decreased CO, decreased CBV, and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) common to all with POTS when upright. We further propose that hyperventilation‐associated POTS occurs when initial reduction in CO is sufficiently large and that circulatory abnormalities normalize with restoration of CO 2. 21, 22

### Pathogenesis and management of myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 2019 [^a214bc44]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest

An increased risk of arrhythmia has recently been reported in patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Electrophysiologically, COVID‐19 patients are prone to the development of tachycardia. A study of 112 COVID‐19 patients reported that 29.5% of patients presented with tachycardia, and other evidence for myocardial injury. The heart rate of COVID‐19 patients appeared to be correlated with troponin levels, suggesting the link of tachycardia to myocardial injury in COVID‐19. In addition to tachycardia, malignant arrhythmia and following cardiac arrest may occur in COVID‐19 patients, specifically in those with myocardial injury, which might lead to sudden cardiac death, reportedly responsible for 11.1% of deaths. A French population‐based study found that the out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest incidence in the COVID‐19 pandemic increased two times over that in the same weeks in the non‐pandemic period, and a third of the increase was caused by suspected or confirmed COVID‐19.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: insights into pathogenesis and treatment [^9a973663]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of chronic dysautonomia, most commonly seen in women of child-bearing age and often associated with reduced quality of life. Current diagnostic criteria require an increase in heart rate of 30 beats per minute (bpm), or over 120 bpm in the first 10 min of standing, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, and associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other symptoms suggestive of autoimmune failure include sudomotor dysfunction and gastrointestinal dysmotility. However, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and uncertainty of pathogenesis, often prompts a search for alternative causes before a diagnosis of POTS, a made.

This months' journal club explores the evidence for an autoimmune basis of dysautonomia in POTS. The first paper evaluates biomarkers of inflammation and possible platelet dysfunction in 34 patients with POTS and autoantibodies against the A1 adrenergic and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The second paper examines the prevalence of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies in patients with POTS compared to healthy controls. The third paper is a case series evaluating use of intravenous immunoglobulin in six patients with refractory immune-mediated POTS.

### Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardia: an ED-oriented algorithmic approach [^df87adbf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias is a common diagnostic conundrum encountered by emergency physicians. Although a number of published algorithms are available to assist the clinician in evaluating features of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), many of these are too cumbersome, requiring multiple decisions and introducing treatment suggestions within the diagnostic framework. To optimize the diagnosis of the narrow complex tachycardia, we propose 3 separate algorithms tailored to address varying levels of available clinical information. The static algorithm depends only on the 12-lead ECG without the benefit of historical data or diagnostic interventions. The comparative algorithm requires a baseline ECG to which the presenting ECG is compared. The dynamic algorithm encourages the clinician to take advantage of diagnostic maneuvers to further elucidate the tachycardia mechanism. Each of these algorithms requires the clinician to answer either "yes" or "no" for each criterion and does not include treatment recommendations.

### V-A-A-V activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: what is the mechanism? [^fb45eb89]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Commentary

The differential diagnosis of a long RP tachycardia with the site of earliest atrial activation at the CS ostium (Fig. 1) includes: (a) a fast-slow type AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), (b) AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) using a slowly conducting posteroseptal accessory pathway as the retrograde limb, and (c) a septal atrial tachycardia (AT). The absence of atrial resetting by premature ventricular stimuli delivered during His-bundle refractoriness was consistent with the absence of retrograde atrial activation over an AP, though did not rule out its concealed presence. This case illustrates an important observation in the differential diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia with an initial "V-A-A-V" sequence upon cessation of ventricular pacing. The atrial response (V-A-A-V or V-A-V) following cessation of entrainment or induction of the tachycardia by ventricular pacing provides useful diagnostic information to distinguish AT from AVNRT. A "V-A-A-V" sequence is typically diagnostic of AT, whereas a "V-A-V" response excludes this diagnosis. However, the study population upon which this criterion was definedmay have been biased by not including atypical AVNRT (which cannot be excluded on the basis of the "V-A-A-V" sequence), whereas typical AV nodal reentry, which was included in that study, is unlikely to explain the second "A" of the "V-A-A-V" sequence, which occurs immediately after the first "A", caused by retrograde conduction though the AV node. Therefore, it is important to identify the origin of both "A" of an initial "V-A-A-V" activation sequence to distinguish atypical AVNRT from AT. In the case of AT, its induction by ventricular stimulation, though not inconceivable, is unlikely. Furthermore, because of the different sites of earliest activation of the first versus second "A", one can readily exclude a pseudo V-A-A-V response after the cessation of ventricular entrainment of atypical AVNRT, where the first and second "A" are produced by the penultimate and the last paced cycles, respectively, resulting in a long interval due to slow conduction over a slow pathway. It is noteworthy that another initial "V-A-V" activation sequence, with the earliest "A" recorded at the CS ostium, was reproducibly observed when the tachycardia was induced by premature ventricular stimulation or by rapid pacing (Fig. 2), confirming the diagnosis of AVNRT. The "V-A-V" sequence was caused by atrial capture over a slow pathway, and conduction block over a refractory fast pathway. Thus, the initial "V-A-A-V" sequence is explained by dual atrial activation from the last ventricular paced cycle, where the first "A" was produced by retrograde conduction over a fast pathway, and the second "A" by retrograde conduction over a slow pathway. 3,4 To our knowledge, the induction of atypical AVNRT by an initial "V-A-A-V" or "V-A-V" in the same patient is probably rare.–This case shows that a "V-A-A-V" response observed upon cessation of ventricular pacing is not an electrophysiological proof of diagnosis of AT.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^1577e5db]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a syndrome in which the sinus heart rate is inexplicably faster than expected and associated symptoms are present. The heart rate at rest, even in a supine position, can exceed 100 beats/min; minimal activity accelerates the rate rapidly and substantially. Patients with IST may require restriction from physical activity. Mechanisms responsible for IST are understood incompletely. It is important to distinguish IST from so-called appropriate sinus tachycardia and from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with which overlap may occur. Because the long-term outcome seems to be benign, treatment may be unnecessary or may be as simple as physical training. However, for patients with intolerable symptoms, therapeutic measures are warranted. Even at high doses, β-adrenergic blockers, the first-line therapy, often are ineffective; the same is true for most other medical therapies. In rare instances, catheter- or surgically- based right atrial or sinus node modification may be helpful, but even this is fraught with limited efficacy and potential complications. Overtreatment, in an attempt to reduce symptoms, can be difficult to avoid, but is discouraged.

### Heart failure and sudden death in patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and recurrent tachycardia [^cb4fa1fe]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of heart failure. We hypothesized that although left ventricular ejection fraction measurements normalize after heart rate or rhythm control in patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, recurrent tachycardia may have abrupt and deleterious consequences.

Methods and Results

Patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy that developed over years were evaluated and treated. Tachycardia episodes and outcomes were assessed. Twenty-four patients were identified. All had NYHA functional class III heart failure or greater on presentation. One third were heart transplant candidates. There were 17 men and 7 women with a mean age of 46 ± 16 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.26 ± 0.09 at the index visit. The cause was atrial fibrillation (n = 13), atrial flutter (n = 4), atrial tachycardia (n = 3), idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (n = 1), permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (n = 2), and bigeminal ventricular premature contractions (n = 1). Within 6 months of rate control or correction of the rhythm, left ventricular ejection fraction improved or normalized and symptoms abated in all. Five patients had tachycardia recur. In these patients, left ventricular ejection fraction dropped precipitously and heart failure ensued within 6 months, even though the initial impairment took years. Rate control eliminated heart failure and improved or normalized ejection fraction in 6 months. Three of 24 patients died suddenly and unexpectedly.

Conclusions

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy develops slowly and appears reversible by left ventricular ejection fraction improvement, but recurrent tachycardia causes rapid decline in left ventricular function and development of heart failure. Sudden death is possible.

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia — definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term "hemodynamically unstable" has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

Vasovagal syncope — epidemiology and outcomes — emergency department cohorts generally feature older patients with mean ages around 60–65 years, and approximately 35% of patients with syncope remain undiagnosed. Approximately 30%–50% of patients with syncope are diagnosed with an autonomically mediated form, most of which are vasovagal. The overall 1-year recurrence rate is approximately 25%–35%, and this rate can be predicted by the number of syncopes in the year prior to assessment. Most patients stop fainting after assessment and in the absence of specific therapy.

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and PVC-related cardiomyopathy — key features and management: tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of heart failure (HF) and impaired left ventricular function; in a single-center series of patients with frequent PVCs, 11% had sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 7% had tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy; PVCs are very common and usually do not require treatment in the absence of symptoms, but treatment is critical when symptoms are troublesome, polymorphic VT is triggered, or cardiomyopathy occurs; among patients referred for ablation, 174 consecutive cases were reported with 54 having depressed left ventricular function, and "in the presence of a PVC burden ≥ 24%, it may be helpful to suppress the PVCs by catheter ablation or drug therapy to avoid the development of cardiomyopathy"; alternatively, "a strategy of active surveillance is appropriate for the majority of patients with frequent idiopathic PVCs in association with preserved LVEF"; factors associated with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy include PVC QRS width > 150 ms, among others.

### Large cohort study finds possible association between postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and COVID-19 vaccination but far stronger link with SARS-CoV-2 infection… [^44d6647c]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Seven patients newly diagnosed with POTS were either medical students or physicians. They had no recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which, research has suggested, is associated with an increased risk of POTS. The autonomic disorder commonly occurs after a viral or bacterial infection and is characterized by brain fog, fatigue, and lightheadedness and increased heart rate upon standing — symptoms also seen in people with postacute sequela of COVID-19. Because the patients were health care workers, they were among the first to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, leading Chung to wonder whether POTS could be linked to COVID-19 vaccination in addition to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eventually, a few case reports appeared in the medical literature, from Japan, Korea, and the US, about new-onset POTS in previously healthy people who'd recently received a messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine.

But these were only 3 reported cases out of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses administered, far too few on which to base any conclusions. Given that POTS is known to be one of the PASC syndromes, it is biologically plausible "for a similar, even if attenuated, systemic response to vaccine, " Kwan and his coauthors wrote. Interestingly, Kwan noted, although POTS in general is much more common among women, his study found the incidence to be similar in women and men. He said it's unclear whether POTS associated with COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection is different from other POTS cases. A more precise approach to identify new POTS cases after vaccination would be to perform a diagnostic test for the condition before vaccination and then several weeks afterward, Coady said. One such test measures blood pressure and heart rate while lying down and then while standing for 10 minutes.

A heart rate increase of at least 30 beats per minute, coupled with a drop in blood pressure of no more than 20 mm Hg, is characteristic of POTS. To assess the validity of their approach, he and his coauthors clinically adjudicated 50 sequentially encountered patients identified as having both unspecified cardiac arrythmia and unspecified disorder of the autonomic nervous system. They found that 40 of those patients either had been formally confirmed as having POTS through comprehensive diagnostic testing or had signs and symptoms consistent with guideline definitions of the condition but were still awaiting full diagnostic testing for confirmation.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: narrow QRS complex tachycardias [^b4d5b49b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Narrow QRS complex tachycardia is a common dysrhythmia in Emergency Medicine practice. Diagnosis and mechanism often can be made by 12-lead electrocardiographic (EKG) analysis but may subsequently require electrophysiologic testing. The clinical manifestations are varied and dependent upon heart rate, prior cardiac disease, and general physiologic status. Patient management is directed towards the etiology and mechanism of the dysrhythmia and includes vagal maneuvers, pharmacologic therapy, and cardioversion. Hemodynamically compromised patients must be promptly treated. Patients are often admitted to the hospital but selected patients can be safely discharged from the Emergency Department for outpatient evaluation and management. Pediatric and pregnant patients are, in general, treated the same as adults. Several case examples and EKGs are presented.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^39a6a7fa]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia — diagnostic approach specifies that a thorough medical history review and physical examination should be performed, a 12-lead ECG is useful to document tachycardia and determine sinus rhythm, a 24-hour Holter monitor can be useful for confirming the diagnosis, and patients with POTS and IST can present similar symptoms with differing stress triggers; autonomic reflex tests should not be used routinely given unproven usefulness, treadmill exercise testing might be useful to document an exaggerated tachycardic response though not validated, and IST is rarely associated with tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

### Thyrotoxicosis [^da3b3d1a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a diagnosis existing along a spectrum of severity. Patients present with a variety of signs and symptoms: tachycardia, elevated heart rate, anxiety, changes in mental status, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperthermia. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm is heavily dependent on outpatient evaluation. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of hyperthyroidism with the highest mortality. Management of thyroid storm follows a stepwise approach, with resuscitation and detection of the precipitating cause being paramount. Special attention should be paid to cardiac function in patients with thyroid storm before treatment, as these patients may develop cardiac collapse.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^383267ab]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Secondary diseases caused by VA include PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, which can present with typical symptoms of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF). If PVCs are asymptomatic, the diagnosis is commonly made by a routine physical exam and is confirmed by a 12-lead ECG.

Underlying pathologies resulting in VA are numerous and include ischemia; cardiomyopathy; genetic diseases (eg, inherited arrhythmia syndromes); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); ARVC; CHD; infiltrative, inflammatory, or infectious diseases; and correctible causes, such as electrolyte abnormalities or medication adverse effects. If VAs themselves are asymptomatic, the presenting symptoms will mostly depend on the underlying pathology and might include chest pain, heart failure, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac death. A careful history and physical exam with a review of the family history, ECG, imaging, and laboratory data will direct diagnosis and specific treatment (eg, immunosuppression in cardiac sarcoidosis). If inherited arrhythmia syndromes are suspected (eg, long QT syndrome), genetic testing should be considered.

ICD therapy including shocks is an increasingly common presentation of VAs in patients with CIEDs, and appropriate ICD therapy occurs in the first year in.50% of patients with secondary and approximately 5% of patients with primary prevention ICDs.

Combined presentations of those scenarios are common, such as worsening heart failure status with increased arrhythmias burden or acute MI presenting with sudden cardiac death as a manifestation of the VAs.

Given that presenting symptoms of VA vary widely, careful documentation and correlation of the specific arrhythmia (ECG, telemetry, Holter or event monitor, electrograms) with the presenting symptoms is important to guide further workup and therapy. Symptoms commonly attributed to VA (eg, palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, syncope) are nonspecific and can either be due to other arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachycardia [SVT] or bradycardia), other cardiac diseases, noncardiac conditions, anxiety, or have no clear identifiable cause.

### V-A-A-V activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: what is the mechanism? [^45723c45]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 52-year-old woman with a history of multiple episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia underwent electrophysiologic studies and a catheter ablation procedure. The 12-lead electrocardiogram during tachycardia showed a long RP tachycardia with negative P waves in leads II, III, and aVF. At baseline, dual atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoatrial (VA) nodal conduction was elicited by atrial and ventricular premature stimulation. During intravenous administration of isoproterenol, the earliest site of atrial activation during ventricular pacing was observed near the His bundle, and a previously recorded narrow QRS tachycardia was reproducibly induced by premature or rapid ventricular apical pacing, with an initial V-A-A-V activation sequence (Fig. 1). During tachycardia, the HA and AH intervals measured 71 and 342 milliseconds, respectively, and the earliest atrial activation was recorded at the ostium of the coronary sinus (CS). The earliest first "A" of the initial "V-A-A-V" activation sequence was recorded in the His bundle region, reflecting conduction over a fast pathway (FP), as was observed during ventricular pacing, while the second "A" was recorded near the CS ostium, as was observed during the tachycardia. The interval between the first and second "A" was often shorter than the subsequent tachycardia cycle length. Premature ventricular stimuli delivered during tachycardia while the His bundle was refractory did not reset the atrial cycle. From these observations, what is the mechanism of tachycardia?

Figure 1
Right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing at an S-S cycle length of 380 milliseconds induced a long RP tachycardia, with the earliest site of atrial activation at the ostium of the coronary sinus (A5–6), following an initial "V-A-A-V" electrogram sequence. The numbers between the atrial electrograms on the A 5–6 channel indicate the cycle length in milliseconds. See text for further explanations. I, II, and V₁ = surface electrocardiogram; HBE 1–2 and 3–4 = distal to proximal His bundle region; a 9–10 to 1–2 = proximal to distal CS recording.

### Electrical management of heart failure: from pathophysiology to treatment [^fd56317b]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy

The time to develop and the severity of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy (T-CM) are dependent on the type, rate, and duration of tachycardia. Although likely underestimated, the prevalence of T-CM has been reported in close to 3% of all patients referred for catheter ablation. Although less common, AT and permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia are also frequently associated with T-CM with a prevalence as high as 59 and 23%, respectively. Nevertheless, AF and atrial flutter are some of the most frequent causes of T-CM due to their high prevalence in the adult population. Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy typically presents with palpitations, HF symptoms, and severe LV systolic dysfunction. Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy should be strongly considered in patients with poor LV systolic function and persistent or frequent paroxysmal tachycardia without other obvious aetiology. Importantly, T-CM diagnosis can only be confirmed if LV recovery is documented within few weeks or months after treatment.

The main treatment of T-CM is the elimination of tachycardia with either antiarrhythmics and/or catheter ablation. In the ESC guidelines, catheter ablation has a IB indication to reverse LV dysfunction in AF patients when T-CM is probable. However, standard HF medical therapy should not be ignored to maximize LV recovery. While eliminating tachycardia will resolve LV systolic dysfunction and HF symptoms, persistent myocardial fibrosis will remain and in part contribute to an 8–12% risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with VT despite resolution of T-CM. Surveillance of recurrent tachycardia after treatment is key, since its recurrence can result in a more rapid and severe clinical presentation. Therefore, catheter ablation should be strongly considered in patients with arrhythmias known to have a high success rate (e.g. atrial flutter, AT, AV reciprocating tachycardia).

Disease-specific etiologies of heart failure — Certain conditions that cause HF require disease-specific therapeutic approaches; for example, in amyloid heart disease, whether on the basis of transthyretin or light chain deposition, there are specific treatments that otherwise would not be used in patients with HF. Hence, expeditious and accurate diagnosis of such conditions is important, and HF attributable to sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly, connective tissue disease, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or high-output HF from an arteriovenous fistula, among others, requires specific therapeutic approaches; the history and the physical examination can provide clues to narrow the number of causes to consider and guide the diagnostic approach to identify such conditions.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^346f5c47]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial fibrillation:

- **Definition**: AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically MS, or a prosthetic heart valve.
- **Pathophysiology**: The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, HF), genetics, sex, and other factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AF in the US ranges is estimated at 700–775 cases per 100,000 persons.
- **Disease course**: In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which lead to symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of HF; as well as stasis of blood in the LAA, which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

### The differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^cc2a1553]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia is defined as a cardiac rhythm with a rate greater than 100 beats/min (bpm) and a QRS complex duration greater than 0.10 to 0.12seconds (s) in the adult patient; wide complex tachycardia (WCT) in children is defined according to age-related metrics. The differential diagnosis of the WCT includes ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant intraventricular conduction, including both relatively benign and life-threatening dysrhythmias. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis of WCT with a discussion of strategies useful in making the appropriate diagnosis, when possible.

Cardiac channelopathies — family screening and genetic testing are recommended for first-degree relatives when a pathogenic mutation is known, with attention to ECG limitations and pediatric screening. In first-degree relatives of patients who have a causative mutation for long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, short QT syndrome, or Brugada syndrome, genetic counseling and mutation-specific genetic testing are recommended. Clinical screening of first-degree relatives of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes is crucial to identifying affected family members, and targeted screening for the identified family-specific mutation can identify individuals who are at risk for these adverse outcomes. Screening ECGs may be insufficient for diagnosis because the resting ECG in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is normal, and as many as 25% of genotype-positive patients with long QT syndrome have QTc intervals ≤ 440 ms. Screening infants and young children is particularly important, but because up to 15% of mutations previously associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia do not appear to cause disease, caution is advised; notably, some patients may prefer not to undergo genetic testing, so genetic counseling should focus on this issue.

Shared decision making in SVT — "It is important that the patient be included in clinical decision-making processes, with consideration of his/her preferences and goals for therapy, as well as his/her unique physical, psychological, and social situation". "In selected cases, personalized, self-directed interventions can be developed in partnership with the patient, such as vagal maneuvers and 'pill-in-the-pocket' drug therapy". "Shared decision making is especially important for patients with SVT", and "SVT treatment can be nuanced and requires expert knowledge of EP processes and treatment options". Options "are highly specific to the exact type of arrhythmia and can depend on certain characteristics of a particular arrhythmia (eg, whether there is pre-excitation)", so "a detailed explanation of the benefits and risks must be included in the conversation", with patients "encouraged to ask questions" and clinicians using "lay terminology" to provide "the best possible understanding of all management options in terms of risks, benefits, and potential effects on quality of life".

### Fascicular ventricular tachycardias: potential role of the septal fascicle [^00d89640]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ventricular tachycardias involving the fascicular system are amongst the most challenging and intriguing arrhythmias for cardiac electrophysiologists. Although some of the more common forms have been recognized clinically for decades, other variants continue to be characterized. Moreover, considerable uncertainty persists to date with regards to the mechanisms underpinning these arrhythmias. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss the seminal historical and contemporary observations that have collectively advanced our understanding of fascicular ventricular tachycardias. From this base, we canvas the basic and clinical evidence supporting a potential role for the septal fascicular network and propose a new schema hypothesizing involvement of this fascicle. Although we focus primarily on the most common left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia, our discussion and proposal have mechanistic and therapeutic implications for the spectrum of fascicular arrhythmias.

### The dermatological manifestations of postural tachycardia syndrome: a review with illustrated cases [^9a73e6d8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome of excessive tachycardia with orthostatic challenge, and relief of such symptoms with recumbence. There are several proposed subtypes of the syndrome, each with unique pathophysiology. Numerous symptoms such as excessive tachycardia, lightheadedness, blurry vision, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, and tremulousness are associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other co-morbid conditions associated with POTS are not clearly attributable to orthostatic intolerance. These include chronic headache, fibromyalgia, functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. Dermatological manifestations of POTS are also common and wide ranging, from livedo reticularis to Raynaud's phenomenon, from cutaneous flushing to erythromelalgia. Here, we provide three illustrative cases of POTS with dermatological manifestations. We discuss the potential pathophysiology underlying such dermatological manifestations, and how such mechanisms could in turn help guide development of management.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: a reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^c3812e65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is a general term that broadly denotes the presence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular WCT (SWCT). As such, clinicians who encounter patients with a WCT must consider a broad variety of attributable causes including VT, SWCT with preexisting or functional aberrancy, SWCT developing from impulse propagation using atrioventricular accessory pathways (ie, preexcitation), rapid ventricular pacing, and tachyarrhythmias coinciding with toxic‐metabolic QRS duration widening (eg, hyperkalemia or antiarrhythmic drug toxicity). Yet, without question, the most critical task for the clinician is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin. Accurate discrimination of VT and SWCT is incredibly vital as it impacts immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long‐term management strategies. Hence, proper patient management heavily relies on whether clinicians are equipped with and appropriately apply effective and reliable means to distinguish VT and SWCT.

After decades of rigorous research, the quest for an effective, simplified, and practical means to noninvasively differentiate WCTs has brought forth an ever‐expanding plethora of manually applied ECG interpretation methods. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 While manual methods have proven their value in research settings, and can be readily adopted by clinicians, arriving at correct and timely VT or SWCT diagnoses remains a problematic undertaking — even among experienced electrocardiographers. Recently, research has shown that accurate WCT differentiation can even be accomplished by automated approaches implemented by computerized ECG interpretation (CEI) software programs. 11, 12

In this review, we provide an in‐depth analysis of traditional and contemporary methods to differentiate WCTs. In doing so, we: (1) review hallmark ECG characteristics used for VT and SWCT differentiation, (2) examine the conceptual and structural design of standard WCT differentiation methods, (3) highlight practical limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches, and (4) discuss recently devised methods designed to differentiate WCTs automatically.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^0ec41809]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated sympathetic response to assuming an upright position. Up till recently, it was largely under-recognised as a clinical entity. There is now consensus about the definition of POTS as a greater than 30/min heart rate increase on standing from a supine position (greater than 40/min increase in 12-19-year-old patients) or an absolute heart rate of greater than 120/min within 10 min of standing from a supine position and in the absence of hypotension, arrhythmias, sympathomimetic drugs or other conditions that cause tachycardia. We present two cases of POTS, followed by a discussion of its pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology and management.

### Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^4276099a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Systolic dysfunction associated with chronic tachyarrhythmias, known as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, is a reversible form of heart failure characterized by left ventricular dilatation that is usually reversible once the tachyarrhythmia is controlled. Its development is related to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The diagnosis is usually made following observation of a marked improvement in systolic function after normalization of heart rate. Clinicians should be aware that patients with unexplained systolic dysfunction may have tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and that controlling the arrhythmia may result in improvement and even complete normalization of systolic function.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation — wide-complex tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia (VT) differentiation is aided by obtaining a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia and during sinus rhythm, and a wide-complex tachycardia (QRS duration > 120 ms) may represent either VT or a supraventricular rhythm with abnormal conduction. Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation with ventricular rate faster than atrial rate or fusion complexes provides the diagnosis of VT, while concordance of precordial QRS complexes suggests VT or pre-excitation and QRS complexes identical to sinus rhythm are consistent with SVT. Because the failure to correctly identify VT can be potentially life threatening and when doubt exists it is safest to assume any wide-complex tachycardia is VT, adenosine is suggested if a wide-complex tachycardia is monomorphic, regular, and hemodynamically tolerated, because it may help convert the rhythm to sinus and may help in the diagnosis.

Orthostatic intolerance and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — clinical features and relevance to syncope: Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

Conclusions

Here, we highlight the results of the largest known survey of patients with a diagnosis of POTS. We believe these results provide important insights into the background, clinical features and diagnostic journey of patients suffering from this condition. We believe these data will serve as an essential step for moving forward with future studies aimed at better identifying these patients and establishing better treatments for their symptoms.

### Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: terminology, mechanism, diagnosis, and emergency therapy [^a4a5ac5b]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic characteristics but have different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are contraindicated for the other. Yet confusion about terminology, and thus diagnosis and therapy, continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.

### Diagnostic approach to palpitations [^0334ea1a]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpitations-sensations of a rapid or irregular heartbeat-are most often caused by cardiac arrhythmias or anxiety. Most patients with arrhythmias do not complain of palpitations. However, any arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations should be considered as potentially more serious if they are associated with dizziness, near-syncope, or syncope. Nonarrhythmic cardiac problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, and congestive heart failure, and noncardiac problems, such as hyperthyroidism, vasovagal syncope, and hypoglycemia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations also can result from stimulant drugs, and over-the-counter and prescription medications. No cause for the palpitations can be found in up to 16 percent of patients. Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring usually is indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: a hidden danger [^7b1e641f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogenous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical and delayed OH as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: new concepts in pathophysiology and management [^b0777f8a]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common and therapeutically challenging condition affecting numerous people worldwide. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the pathophysiology of this disorder. At the same time, both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies have emerged that offer additional treatment options for those afflicted with this condition. This paper reviews new concepts in both the pathophysiology and management of POTS.

### Initial evaluation and management of wide-complex tachycardia: a simplified and practical approach [^7ea25ef8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The evaluation and treatment of wide QRS-complex tachycardia remains a challenge, and mismanagement is quite common. Diagnostic aids such as wide-complex tachycardia algorithms perform poorly in the real-life setting. The purpose of this review is to offer a simple clinical-electrocardiographic approach for the initial evaluation and management of the adult patient with stable wide-complex tachycardia that does not require recollection of complex guidelines or algorithms.

### Best evidence topic report. differential diagnosis of narrow complex tachycardias by increasing electrocardiograph speed [^04aed0b4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A shortcut review was carried out to establish whether increasing the paper speed during ECG recording could improve the accuracy of diagnosis of narrow complex tachycardias. Altogether 256 papers were found using the reported search, of which one presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date, and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated in table 2. It is concluded that increasing paper speed does indeed improve diagnostic accuracy.
