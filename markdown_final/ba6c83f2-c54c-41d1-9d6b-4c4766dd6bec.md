## Question

Gail model

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Gail model's purpose, inputs, performance, limitations, and practical use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the model's definition and intended clinical applications. Then, I should verify the input variables and how the model calculates risk. Next, I will review validation and calibration data, followed by discrimination metrics. After that, I need to examine limitations, including population specificity, family history scope, and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical guidance, including thresholds, alternatives, and how to integrate emerging data like breast density and genetics, while double-checking guideline concordance and FDA labeling details.

> Let me first confirm the model's identity and purpose. The Gail model, also known as the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), estimates a woman's absolute risk of developing invasive breast cancer over a defined interval, most commonly 5 years, and up to lifetime, using personal and family risk factors; it is widely used to identify candidates for chemoprevention and to inform counseling, but not to assess BRCA-related hereditary risk or MRI eligibility, which require different tools and thresholds [^1164EhcV] [^115hjdSA] [^114w1bgn].

> I need to check the core inputs and mechanics. The model incorporates current age, age at menarche, age at first live birth or nulliparity, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of prior breast biopsies, and presence of atypical hyperplasia; it applies relative risks from logistic regression and converts to absolute risk using age-specific incidence and competing mortality from SEER, with race/ethnicity-specific calibrations for non-Hispanic White, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latina, and Asian/Pacific Islander women in the United States [^1164EhcV] [^116qqAS9] [^116XjGdm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about performance without calibration data. Multiple validations show the Gail model is generally well calibrated at the population level, with expected-to-observed ratios close to 1.0 in several cohorts, though it can under- or over-predict in specific subgroups; for example, in Nurses' Health Study data the E/O was about 0.94 overall, and in large mammography cohorts the Gail model showed good calibration with O/E near 1.0, while recalibration to updated incidence rates improved underprediction seen in older cohorts [^115eHdU6] [^111XSA7L] [^115rj8gk].

> Wait, let me verify discrimination, because that drives individual-level utility. The concordance statistic for 5-year risk prediction is modest, typically around 0.55–0.60 in large cohorts, indicating only small improvement over age alone; this modest discrimination is consistent across WHI and NHS analyses and aligns with USPSTF evidence syntheses showing C statistics in the 0.55–0.65 range for most clinical models [^115eHdU6] [^113xYDUR].

> I should confirm limitations and where the model struggles. The Gail model is not designed for women with prior invasive or in situ breast cancer, for BRCA1/2 carriers, or for women under 35; it considers only first-degree relatives, potentially underestimating risk in families with second-degree or paternal lineage disease, and it may underestimate risk in Black women with prior biopsies and in some Hispanic subgroups; performance is also reduced in women with atypical hyperplasia, where it markedly underestimates risk and shows poor discrimination, and it performs less well for ER-negative disease than ER-positive disease [^1164EhcV] [^114w1bgn] [^112MAgBN] [^112iUsUD].

> Let me consider special populations more carefully. In women aged 75 and older, the model tends to overestimate absolute risk unless restricted to those undergoing mammography without significant comorbidity, reinforcing the need to account for competing mortality; in systemic lupus erythematosus cohorts, observed incidence exceeded Gail predictions, suggesting unmodeled immunologic or treatment-related risks; and in Asian populations, absolute risks and model performance can differ, underscoring the importance of ancestry-specific calibration and, where available, PRS integration [^1153Ua34] [^114QZwYn] [^1125Kbti].

> Next, I should review how the Gail model is used clinically. The 5-year risk threshold of 1.67% (approximately 1.66–1.7%) is commonly used to identify candidates for discussion of chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, with some guidelines recommending a 3% 5-year threshold for stronger consideration; these thresholds are reflected in FDA labels and consensus statements, though shared decision-making is essential given side effects and individual risk tolerance [^113SbXYk] [^1118gKcF] [^117BSS3y] [^1165eHC3].

> But wait, what if a patient has atypia or a strong family history — does Gail suffice? I should double-check alternatives. For women with extensive family history or suspected hereditary risk, models like Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPRO, or BOADICEA better capture pedigree structure and genetic risk; for MRI eligibility, lifetime risk thresholds of 20–25% are typically assessed with Tyrer-Cuzick or BRCAPRO rather than Gail; and for women with atypia, risk is substantially higher than Gail estimates, so prevention counseling should proceed irrespective of Gail thresholds [^111wXQpq] [^114w1bgn] [^112MAgBN] [^113HXmaT].

> I will now examine how to enhance risk prediction beyond Gail. Adding mammographic breast density improves discrimination modestly, with AUC gains on the order of 0.03–0.06 in several studies; incorporating a polygenic risk score based on common SNPs provides additional independent information and improves reclassification, particularly in women at intermediate Gail risk; and emerging AI-derived image-based models show substantially higher discrimination than traditional clinical models, though long-term validation and integration into workflows are ongoing [^116idTdP] [^11483Heh] [^114KAABM].

> Hold on, I should verify practical implementation issues. Provider uptake of formal risk assessment is inconsistent, with surveys showing limited routine use of Gail and low chemoprevention prescribing, driven by time constraints and unfamiliarity; educational interventions can partially close knowledge gaps, but sustained integration into primary care workflows remains challenging, especially when models disagree at the individual level and thresholds vary by guideline [^115RGf1c] [^112uBp9S] [^116k6anh].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure alignment with evidence. The Gail model remains a useful, population-calibrated tool for estimating 5-year and lifetime invasive breast cancer risk in average-risk women over 35, particularly to identify candidates for chemoprevention discussions, but its modest discrimination and specific limitations necessitate careful selection of scenarios, awareness of underestimation in certain subgroups, and judicious use of alternative models and complementary risk factors such as breast density and PRS when appropriate [^113xYDUR] [^1164EhcV] [^116idTdP] [^11483Heh].

---

The **Gail model** is a validated tool for estimating 5-year and lifetime invasive breast cancer risk in women aged ≥ 35 years without a personal history of breast cancer [^1164EhcV]. It uses age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, and presence of atypical hyperplasia [^111SQuJT] to calculate absolute risk and is widely used to identify candidates for chemoprevention and enhanced screening [^11641vCA]. The model has modest discrimination (**AUC ~0.55–0.65**) [^113xYDUR] and may underestimate risk in women with dense breasts, atypia, or strong family history; adding breast density or genetic markers can improve performance [^116idTdP] [^11483Heh]. It is not designed for **BRCA carriers** or women with prior breast cancer and should be supplemented with other models when appropriate [^115hjdSA] [^114w1bgn].

---

## Development and validation

The Gail model was developed using data from the **Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP)** and the **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program**, incorporating established risk factors such as age, race/ethnicity, reproductive history, family history, and prior breast biopsies [^111SQuJT] [^1153Ua34]. It has been validated in multiple populations, including White, Black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian and Pacific Islander women in the United States [^1164EhcV]. However, the model may **underestimate risk** in certain subgroups, such as Black women with previous biopsies and Hispanic women born outside the United States [^1164EhcV].

---

## Risk factors included in the Gail model

The Gail model incorporates the following risk factors:

- **Age**: Current age of the woman.
- **Race/ethnicity**: White, Black/African American, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander.
- **Age at menarche**: Age at first menstrual period.
- **Age at first live birth**: Age at first childbirth or nulliparity.
- **Number of first-degree relatives**: Mother or sisters with breast cancer.
- **Number of breast biopsies**: Previous breast biopsies.
- **Presence of atypical hyperplasia**: Histological finding of atypical hyperplasia.

---

## Clinical applications

The Gail model is primarily used to:

- **Estimate absolute risk**: Calculate a woman's 5-year and lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer [^1164EhcV].
- **Identify candidates for chemoprevention**: Women with a 5-year risk ≥ 1.67% are considered for tamoxifen or raloxifene [^113SbXYk] [^115cmvf6].
- **Guide screening recommendations**: Inform decisions on enhanced screening or preventive interventions [^111Wt1WE].

---

## Limitations and criticisms

Despite its widespread use, the Gail model has several limitations:

- **Modest discrimination**: The model's discriminatory accuracy is modest, with area under the curve (AUC) values typically ranging from 0.55 to 0.65 [^113xYDUR].
- **Underestimation of risk**: The model may underestimate risk in women with dense breasts, atypical hyperplasia, or strong family history [^112pwGHr] [^112MAgBN].
- **Limited applicability**: The model is not designed for women with a personal history of breast cancer, BRCA mutations, or extensive family history [^115hjdSA] [^114w1bgn].

---

## Modifications and enhancements

Several modifications and enhancements have been proposed to improve the Gail model's accuracy:

- **Incorporation of breast density**: Adding mammographic breast density significantly improves risk prediction accuracy [^116idTdP].
- **Integration of genetic markers**: Combining the Gail model with polygenic risk scores (PRS) or specific genetic variants (e.g. SNPs) modestly improves discrimination and reclassification [^11483Heh] [^1127H2ju].
- **Alternative models**: Models such as Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPRO, and BOADICEA incorporate additional risk factors and may perform better in specific populations [^11641vCA] [^111wXQpq].

## Comparison with other risk assessment models

| **Model** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Gail | - Widely validated <br/> - Simple to use <br/> - Incorporates common risk factors | - Modest discrimination <br/> - Underestimates risk in certain subgroups |
| Tyrer-Cuzick | - Incorporates extensive family history <br/> - Includes breast density | - More complex <br/> - Less accessible to primary care |
| BRCAPRO | - Incorporates genetic testing results <br/> - Detailed family history | - Complex <br/> - Requires genetic counseling |
| BOADICEA | - Incorporates genetic and lifestyle factors <br/> - Detailed family history | - Complex <br/> - Requires specialized software |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend using the Gail model to identify women at increased risk for breast cancer and to guide decisions regarding chemoprevention and enhanced screening [^notfound]. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) endorse its use for risk assessment in women aged 35 years and older without a personal history of breast cancer [^116pLhno].

---

## Recent developments and future directions

Recent developments include efforts to integrate additional risk factors — such as lifestyle factors, genetic markers, and breast density — into the Gail model [^116idTdP] [^11483Heh]. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches are being explored to improve risk prediction accuracy and personalize screening strategies [^114KAABM] [^113Gpakz].

---

The Gail model is a widely used and validated tool for estimating breast cancer risk, but it has modest discrimination and may underestimate risk in certain subgroups. Ongoing research aims to enhance its accuracy by incorporating additional risk factors and leveraging advanced computational methods.

### Validation of the gail et al. model of breast cancer risk prediction and implications for chemoprevention [^115eHdU6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Women and their clinicians are increasingly encouraged to use risk estimates derived from statistical models, primarily that of Gail et al., to aid decision making regarding potential prevention options for breast cancer, including chemoprevention with tamoxifen.

Methods

We evaluated both the goodness of fit of the Gail et al. model 2 that predicts the risk of developing invasive breast cancer specifically and its discriminatory accuracy at the individual level in the Nurses' Health Study. We began with a cohort of 82 109 white women aged 45–71 years in 1992 and applied the model of Gail et al. to these women over a 5-year follow-up period to estimate a 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

The model fit well in the total sample (ratio of expected [E] to observed [O] numbers of cases = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 0.99). Underprediction was slightly greater for younger women (< 60 years), but in most age and risk factor strata, E/O ratios were close to 1.0. The model fit equally well (E/O ratio = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.99) in a subset of women reporting recent screening (i.e., within 1 year before the baseline); among women with an estimated 5-year risk of developing invasive breast cancer of 1.67% or greater, the E/O ratio was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.96 to 1.12). The concordance statistic, which indicates discriminatory accuracy, for the Gail et al. model 2 when used to estimate 5-year risk was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.56 to 0.60). Only 3.3% of the 1354 cases of breast cancer observed in the cohort arose among women who fell into age-risk strata expected to have statistically significant net health benefits from prophylactic tamoxifen use.

Conclusions

The Gail et al. model 2 fit well in this sample in terms of predicting numbers of breast cancer cases in specific risk factor strata but had modest discriminatory accuracy at the individual level. This finding has implications for use of the model in clinical counseling of individual women.

### Evaluating the gail model: racial disparities in breast cancer risk assessment [^113mAY3a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Gail Model, a breast cancer risk calculator initially developed using data from primarily White women, has undergone recalibration using more diverse populations. However, concerns remain that risk is underestimated for certain racial groups.

Methods

This retrospective study evaluated the Gail Model's performance across different racial groups. Electronic medical record data from 31,256 women aged 25–75 who underwent mammograms between July 2020 and June 2023 were collected. The cohort included 11,589 Black/African American, 11,008 White, 5,872 Hispanic/Latino, 1,429 Asian, and 1,358 individuals identifying as other.

Results

Significant differences in high-risk (HR) classification based on Gail scores were observed across racial groups. High-risk classification was highest among White women at 11.4%. Black compared with White women had an odds ratio (OR) 0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2–0.28) of HR classification. This difference persisted when controlling for all other variables. Breast cancer diagnosis rates were similar between Black (1.57%) and White women (1.6%).

Conclusions

These findings indicate a racial disparity in HR classification using the Gail Model. Black women are less likely to be identified as HR despite having comparable rates of cancer to White women. These results highlight the potential limitations of risk assessment algorithms incorporating race as a variable.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^11483Heh]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Gail model is widely used for the assessment of risk of invasive breast cancer based on recognized clinical risk factors. In recent years, a substantial number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer risk have been identified. However, it remains unclear how to effectively integrate clinical and genetic risk factors for risk assessment.

Methods

Seven SNPs associated with breast cancer risk were selected from the literature and genotyped in white non-Hispanic women in a nested case-control cohort of 1664 case patients and 1636 control subjects within the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trial. SNP risk scores were computed based on previously published odds ratios assuming a multiplicative model. Combined risk scores were calculated by multiplying Gail risk estimates by the SNP risk scores. The independence of Gail risk and SNP risk was evaluated by logistic regression. Calibration of relative risks was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The performance of the combined risk scores was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) was used to assess improvement in classification of women into low (< 1.5%), intermediate (1.5%-2%), and high (> 2%) categories of 5-year risk. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.

Results

The SNP risk score was nearly independent of Gail risk. There was good agreement between predicted and observed SNP relative risks. In the analysis for receiver operating characteristic curves, the combined risk score was more discriminating, with area under the curve of 0.594 compared with area under the curve of 0.557 for Gail risk alone (P < .001). Classification also improved for 5.6% of case patients and 2.9% of control subjects, showing an NRI value of 0.085 (P = 1.0 × 10⁻⁵). Focusing on women with intermediate Gail risk resulted in an improved NRI of 0.195 (P = 8.6 × 10⁻⁵).

Conclusions

Combining validated common genetic risk factors with clinical risk factors resulted in modest improvement in classification of breast cancer risks in white non-Hispanic postmenopausal women. Classification performance was further improved by focusing on women at intermediate risk.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^111RFftA]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

When we assessed the performance of a combined risk predictor incorporating both the Gail risk and SNP risk, the combined risk predictor performed better in predicting breast cancer risk than either Gail risk or SNP risk alone. By ROC curve analysis, the AUC for Gail and SNP risk combined was 0.594 (95% CI = 0.575 to 0.612) as compared with Gail risk alone, showing an AUC of 0.557 (95% CI = 0.537 to 0.575). Although this statistically significant improvement was modest, in this dataset, the Gail model itself had an AUC that was only 5.7% greater than that expected by chance.

Although ROC curves are useful in some contexts, they have been criticized for several reasons: 1) they summarize classification information across the full range of sensitivities and specificities (in most clinical contexts, only a subset of these sensitivities and specificities are relevant); 2) they do not provide information about the actual risks predicted by the model; 3) they do not provide information about the proportion of individuals with particularly high- or low-risk values; and 4) the area under the ROC curve, which is the probability that a predicted risk for an individual with an event is higher than for an individual without an event, has minimal direct clinical relevance. Therefore, we used reclassification tables to calculate NRI as a more helpful measure of the potential impact of the Gail × SNP risk score in assessing invasive breast cancer risk. This analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in classification (NRI = 0.085; P = 1.0 × 10 −5). Importantly, NRI can be substantially improved by focusing SNP genotyping on those individuals who are predicted to be at intermediate risk by the Gail score, as these women are most likely to be reclassified after the addition of SNP risk. For example, limiting SNP testing to women with Gail 5-year risks between 1.5% and 2.0% results in a substantially larger NRI of 0.195. Taking this information into account, future efforts should rigorously evaluate the clinical utility of targeted strategies to incorporate the combined risk score into the clinical decision-making process in the context of both breast cancer primary prevention and screening (17−20).

### Current management of lesions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [^117Bp1co]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-risk breast lesions, which comprise benign lesions and in situ carcinomas (lobular carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ), are clinically, morphologically, and biologically heterogeneous and are associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer development, albeit to varying degrees. Recognition and proactive management of such lesions can help to prevent progression to invasive disease, and might, therefore, reduce breast cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. However, this opportunity comes with the possibility of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, necessitating risk-based intervention. Notably, despite the progress in defining the molecular changes associated with carcinogenesis, alterations identifying the individuals with high-risk lesions that will progress to invasive carcinoma remain to be identified. Thus, until reproducible clinicopathological or molecular features predicting an individual's risk of breast cancer are found, management strategies must be defined by population-level risks as determined by models such as the Gail or IBIS models, as well as patient attitudes toward the risks and benefits of interventions. Herein, we review the contemporary approaches to diagnosis and management of high-risk breast lesions. Progress in this area will ultimately be dependent on the ability to individualize risk prediction through better definition of the key drivers in the carcinogenic process.

### Effect of changing breast cancer incidence rates on the calibration of the gail model [^115rj8gk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Gail model combines relative risks (RRs) for five breast cancer risk factors with age-specific breast cancer incidence rates and competing mortality rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 1983 to 1987 to predict risk of invasive breast cancer over a given time period. Motivated by changes in breast cancer incidence during the 1990s, we evaluated the model's calibration in two recent cohorts.

Methods

We included white, postmenopausal women from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -AARP Diet and Health Study (NIH-AARP, 1995 to 2003), and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO, 1993 to 2006). Calibration was assessed by comparing the number of breast cancers expected from the Gail model with that observed. We then evaluated calibration by using an updated model that combined Gail model RRs with 1995 to 2003 SEER invasive breast cancer incidence rates.

Results

Overall, the Gail model significantly underpredicted the number of invasive breast cancers in NIH-AARP, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.89), and in PLCO, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.90). The updated model was well-calibrated overall, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.05) in NIH-AARP and an expected-to-observed ratio of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.06) in PLCO. Of women age 50 to 55 years at baseline, 13% to 14% had a projected Gail model 5-year risk lower than the recommended threshold of 1.66% for use of tamoxifen or raloxifene but ≥ 1.66% when using the updated model. The Gail model was well calibrated in PLCO when the prediction period was restricted to 2003 to 2006.

Conclusion

This study highlights that model calibration is important to ensure the usefulness of risk prediction models for clinical decision making.

### Breast cancer risk reduction and counseling: lifestyle, chemoprevention, and surgery [^111Wt1WE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative approaches to risk assessment are useful for identifying women at increased risk for developing breast cancer for whom genetics consultation, individualized surveillance recommendations, or chemoprevention may be appropriate. A comprehensive medical and family history review can be used to stratify women into categories of breast cancer risk. A quantitative estimate of the probability of developing breast cancer can be determined using risk assessment tools, such as the Gail and Claus models. Women at increased risk for breast cancer may benefit from individualized approaches to breast cancer risk reduction. Prevention strategies for reducing breast cancer risk include lifestyle modifications, chemoprevention, surgical approaches, and pharmacotherapy.

### Personalized early detection and prevention of breast cancer: ENVISION consensus statement [^1156Bc93]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Risk-prediction models

Several breast cancer risk-prediction models are available. Empirical models such as the Gail model, the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk calculatorand the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE) – do not consider explicit genetic models of inheritance and are primarily intended for use in women in the general population. By contrast, genetic models such asand, can, in principle, accommodate detailed family history information (including the exact pedigree structure and information on distant relatives) and can, therefore, be applied both at the general population level and in women with a strong family history of breast cancer. These models all vary in terms of the risk factors considered, the study designs and types of data used in their development, and their analytical methods. The validity and clinical utility of these risk-assessment tools must be demonstrated before they are implemented routinely in the clinical setting.

Validity

Analytical validity refers to the accuracy of the test in measuring the underlying genotypes (for example, through gene-panel testing or sequencing assay for rare mutations), PRSs (for example, using SNP-genotyping technologies) and other lifestyle and hormonal risk factors (which can be self-reported or available through electronic health records). Importantly, the analytical validity of comprehensive breast cancer risk-prediction models also depends on having reliable relative risk estimates for the effects of the various risk factors; having precise risk estimates of the associations with individual rare and common genetic variants; as well as estimates of the joint effects of common genetic variants, the joint effects of common and rare genetic variants, and the combined effects of genetic and other risk factors, including a family history of cancer. Clinical validity refers to the accuracy of the tool in predicting the occurrence of breast cancer.

### Use of the gail model and breast cancer preventive therapy among three primary care specialties [^115RGf1c]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is an issue of serious concern among women of all ages. The extent to which providers across primary care specialties assess breast cancer risk and discuss chemoprevention is unknown.

Methods

Cross-sectional web-based survey completed by 316 physicians in internal medicine (IM), family medicine (FM), and gynecology (GYN) from February to April of 2012. Survey items assessed respondents' frequency of use of the Gail model and chemoprevention, and their attitudes behind practice patterns. Descriptive statistics were used to generate response distributions, and chi-squared tests were used to compare responses among specialties.

Results

The response rate was 55.0% (316/575). Only 40% of providers report having used the Gail model (37% IM, 33% FM, 60% GYN) and 13% report having recommended or prescribed chemoprevention (9% IM, 8% FM, 30% GYN). Among providers who use the Gail model, a minority use it regularly in patients who may be at increased breast cancer risk. Among providers who have prescribed chemoprevention, most have done so five times or fewer. Lack of both time and familiarity were commonly cited barriers to use of the Gail score and chemoprevention.

Conclusions

An overall minority of providers, most notably in FM and IM, use the Gail model to assess, and chemoprevention to decrease, breast cancer risk. Until providers are more consistent in their use of the Gail model (or other breast cancer risk calculator) and chemoprevention, opportunities to intervene in women at increased risk will likely continue to be missed.

### Performance of the breast cancer risk assessment tool among women age 75 years and older [^1153Ua34]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT, "Gail model") is commonly used for breast cancer prediction; however, it has not been validated for women age 75 years and older.

Methods

We used Nurses' Health Study (NHS) data beginning in 2004 and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data beginning in 2005 to compare BCRAT's performance among women age 75 years and older with that in women age 55 to 74 years in predicting five-year breast cancer incidence. BCRAT risk factors include: age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first birth, family history, history of benign breast biopsy, and atypia. We examined BCRAT's calibration by age by comparing expected/observed (E/O) ratios of breast cancer incidence. We examined discrimination by computing c-statistics for the model by age. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Seventy-three thousand seventy-two NHS and 97 081 WHI women participated. NHS participants were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (96.2% vs 84.7% in WHI, P < .001) and were less likely to develop breast cancer (1.8% vs 2.0%, P = 0.02). E/O ratios by age in NHS were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.23, age 57–74 years) and 1.31 (95% CI = 1.18 to 1.45, age ≥ 75 years, P = 0.02), and in WHI 1.03 (95% CI = 0.97 to 1.09, age 55–74 years) and 1.10 (95% CI = 1.00 to 1.21, age ≥ 75 years, P = 0.21). E/O ratio 95% confidence intervals crossed one among women age 75 years and older when samples were limited to women who underwent mammography and were without significant illness. C-statistics ranged between 0.56 and 0.58 in both cohorts regardless of age.

Conclusions

BCRAT accurately predicted breast cancer for women age 75 years and older who underwent mammography and were without significant illness but had modest discrimination. Models that consider individual competing risks of non-breast cancer death may improve breast cancer risk prediction for older women.

### Variation in breast cancer risk model estimates among women in their 40s seen in primary care [^11728Bfi]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: The Gail, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), and Tyrer-Cuzick breast cancer risk prediction models are recommended for use in primary care. Calculating breast cancer risk is particularly important for women in their 40s when deciding on mammography, with some guidelines recommending screening for those with 5-year risk similar to women age 50 (≥ 1.1%). Yet, little is known about risk estimate agreement among models for these women. Materials and Methods: Four hundred nine Boston-area women 40–49 years of age completed a risk questionnaire before a primary care visit to compute their breast cancer risk. The kappa statistic was used to examine when (1) Gail and BCSC agreed on 5-year risk ≥ 1.1%; (2) Gail estimated 5-year risk ≥ 1.7% and Tyrer-Cuzick estimated 10-year risk ≥ 5% (guideline thresholds for recommending prevention medications); and when (3) Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick agreed on lifetime risk ≥ 20% (threshold for breast MRI using Tyrer-Cuzick). Results: Participant mean age was 44.1 years, 56.7% were non-Hispanic white, and 7.8% had a first-degree relative with breast cancer. Of 266 with breast density information to estimate both Gail and BCSC, the models agreed on 5-year risk being ≥ 1.1% for 36 women, kappa = 0.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.23–0.45). Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick estimates led to agreement about prevention medications for 8 women, kappa 0.41 (0.20–0.61), and models agreed on lifetime risk ≥ 20% for 3 women, kappa 0.08 (-0.01 to 0.16). Conclusions: There is weak agreement on breast cancer risk estimates generated by risk models recommended for primary care. Using different models may lead to different clinical recommendations for women in their 40s.

Classification Performance of the Gail × SNP Risk Score

To assess the ability of the Gail × SNP risk score to better classify women's breast cancer risk, we used the ROC curve analysis. We compared classification performance using the Gail risk score, the SNP risk score, and the Gail × SNP risk score (Figure 3). We observed an AUC of 0.594 (95% CI = 0.575 to 0.612) for the combination of Gail × SNP risk compared with AUC of 0.557 (95% CI = 0.537 to 0.575) for Gail risk alone and AUC of 0.587 (95% CI = 0.567 to 0.607) for SNP risk alone. The difference in AUC for the combined risk score vs Gail risk score alone was statistically significant (difference in AUC = 0.037, 95% CI of the difference = 0.025 to 0.051, empirical P < .001). We also computed age-adjusted ROC curves, and all age-adjusted AUC values were within 0.001 of the unadjusted values (data not shown).

Independence of Gail Risk and SNP Risk

The validity of our combined Gail × SNP risk score relied on the independence of Gail risk and SNP risk. Gail risk and SNP risk were tested separately for association with breast cancer incidence by logistic regression with log-transformed predictors. Both were strongly and statistically significantly associated with breast cancer (Table 3). Estimation of breast cancer risk with the SNP risk score gives relative risk estimates roughly proportional to observed disease rates (Table 4). The Gail risk and SNP risk were weakly but statistically significantly correlated (Pearson correlation [r] = 0.042, P = 0.02). The combined predictor formed by multiplying the Gail risk by the SNP risk (Gail × SNP risk) was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk than either component alone (Table 4). Including log-transformed Gail risk and SNP risk as separate terms in the logistic regression model further improved the fit (P = 2.3 × 10 −5) by accommodating the difference in calibration of the two terms. However, in a model with these separate terms, an interaction term did not further improve prediction of breast cancer status (P = 0.5) (data not shown in Table 4).

Table 4
Association of Gail risk, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk, and Gail × SNP risk with invasive breast cancer *

To visualize the properties of SNP risk for different Gail risk categories, we binned the Gail risk and SNP risk scores into quintiles and evaluated the relationship between SNP risk and the odds of developing breast cancer within each Gail risk stratum (Figure 1). The SNP risk was consistently associated with breast cancer within each stratum. This showed further evidence that Gail risk and SNP risk provided independent information about risk.

Figure 1
Observed odds of breast cancer for quintiles of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk, stratified by Gail risk quintile (open circles). The overall odds of breast cancer in our study for case patients and control subjects were 1:1 because equal numbers of case patients and control subjects were selected. Quintiles of Gail and SNP risk are labeled 1–5 from lowest to highest risk. The straight lines represent linear least squares fits to the data within each Gail risk stratum. SNP risk was consistently associated with breast cancer odds within the Gail risk strata.

Table 5
Reclassification for Gail risk vs combined Gail × single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk *

Reclassification performance is sensitive to the number of clinically meaningful risk categories because binning of risk scores conceals improvements in risk estimates that do not cross the prespecified thresholds. If risk thresholds at 1.2%, 1.5%, 1.8%, and 2.4% are chosen to distribute women into quintiles of Gail risk, then NRI increases to 0.141 (Z = 5.63, P = 9.0 × 10 −9). For deciles of Gail risk, NRI is 0.182 (Z = 6.2, P = 2.1 × 10 −10). The NRI is only weakly dependent on the precise placement of the cut points (, available online).

The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of a genetic test can be improved by avoiding testing individuals whose status is unlikely to change as a result of the test. Individuals who are far from the classification cut points are unlikely to be reclassified as a result of the test, and therefore, it is less efficient to test them. Therefore, excluding the tails of the risk distribution from the tested population should result in an improved NRI, with reclassification of a higher proportion of tested individuals. We evaluated NRI across a grid of possible lower and upper bounds of Gail risk. Excluding women in the tails of the risk distribution resulted in higher NRI (, available online). If all women with Gail risk less than 1.5% or greater than 2.0% were excluded, then NRI improved to 0.195 (Z = 3.8, P = 8.6 × 10 −5). To address a possible bias in the NRI estimate, we determined the empirical distribution of NRI from 25 000 replicate datasets, where we recalculated Gail × SNP risk using permuted SNP risk scores. The mean NRI for women with Gail risk between 1.5% and 2.0% in these replicates was 0.024. Our observed NRI adjusted for this bias was 0.171 and remained statistically significant (empirical P = 0.0004).

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^114FjfbB]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

As with other disorders with complex inheritance, like prostate cancer, Crohn's disease, and hypercholesterolemia, the discovery and validation of SNPs associated with breast cancer risk have created an opportunity to explore whether a panel of SNPs can be used to predict disease risk and to assess the clinical relevance of such a panel. In the context of breast cancer, the assessment of invasive cancer risk has important clinical implications that can affect decisions about appropriate counseling, screening regimens, and risk reduction strategies (,–). Thus, improvements in risk prediction have the potential to affect clinical care if they are demonstrated to have clinical validity and utility.

For sporadic (nonfamilial) breast cancer, the Gail model has been commonly used to produce individual risk estimates in women. The model incorporates individual risk factors including age, family history (breast cancer among first-degree relatives), personal reproductive history (age at menarche and at first live birth), and personal medical history (number of previous breast biopsies and presence of biopsy-confirmed atypical hyperplasia) to estimate the 5-year risk and lifetime risk of invasive breast cancer in an individual. The model uses relative risk calculation based on logistic regression of these risk factors, followed by conversion to absolute risk based on epidemiological data for breast cancer incidence and competing risks. A projected Gail 5-year risk score (5-year absolute risk of breast cancer diagnosis) of greater than or equal to 1.66% is an important tool to identify women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and may benefit from risk reduction with selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators. Therefore, this model has implications for primary prevention of invasive breast cancer. However, both the discriminatory accuracy of the Gail model and its calibration in certain populations have been challenged (22−23), and uptake of primary prevention strategies among physicians caring for women at increased risk for sporadic breast cancer has been modest.

### Chemoprevention for breast cancer [^116pLhno]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Determining Eligibility for Preventive Therapy/Risk Assessment Tools

The American Society of Clinical Oncology, the NCCN, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) advise counseling women ≥ 35 years of age who are at increased risk for breast cancer regarding available medications to reduce their risk and to offer medication to women at low risk of medication-related side effects (USPSTF B recommendation).–The Gail model risk calculator is the most widely utilized tool to identify candidates suitable for chemoprevention.–The original validated Gail model was updated and modified to become the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) by the National Cancer Institute and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Biostatistics Center. The BCRAT includes the following breast cancer risk factors: current age, reproductive history (age at menarche, age at first live birth), history of prior breast disease (number of previous breast biopsies and history of AH), and family history (number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer), with age being the most heavily weighted risk factor.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^112gaXQt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on breast cancer risk reduction recommend assessing family history and referring to genetic counseling when appropriate as well as use of the modified Gail or Tyrer-Cuzick model to assess risk among women older than age 34 years. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has also established criteria for genetic testing for high-risk mutations. These guidelines recommend assessment no earlier than age 18 years based on family history. No specific tool is recommended, and the recommendations are not specific to reducing the risk of early-onset cancer (see Appendix 8, available online at, for complete evidence summary).

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^116CDVzh]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

A recent study has performed a similar evaluation of breast cancer risk models incorporating SNP information, which combined case patients and control subjects from four cohort studies and one case–control study (including the WHI Observational Study), and refit Gail and SNP model parameters rather than comparing prespecified models. It reported a difference in AUC of 0.038 from adding SNP information to the best clinical risk model compared with 0.037 in our study. Although NRI itself was not reported, it can be calculated from the reported data for quintiles of risk, and the resulting NRI of 0.141 matches our result. These results suggest that our reported differences in model performance are somewhat robust to differences in underlying data and model-fitting methodologies.

The use of improved risk models, such as the one described in our study, may benefit the public health if shown to have clinical utility when combined with optimal individualized screening and risk reduction strategies. We agree with previous assessments that the benefits are likely to be modest, although our work points to several strategies that may give better results. A previous evaluation of potential utility considered an unselective strategy for SNP testing broadly applied to women regardless of Gail risk. Our results suggest that, because utility is sensitive to how a test is targeted, it may be wise to focus further evaluation of the application of SNP genotyping for breast cancer risk on women at intermediate risk as measured by the Gail model. Such a strategy clearly boosts classification performance in this study. Use of broad highly multiplexed multi-disease SNP panels would also improve cost-effectiveness by reducing the marginal cost of testing. Future research should assess performance in population-based cohorts and ultimately address whether classification improvement can be translated into improved prevention and/or screening outcomes in the clinic.

### Somatic genetic aberrations in benign breast disease and the risk of subsequent breast cancer [^115LeCFS]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

From 1989 to 2016 the mortality rate for breast cancer (BC) in the United States decreased by 40%, a testament to the efficacy of targeted therapies, as well as to combinations and schedules of chemotherapeutics. During this same period breast cancer incidence rates remained static; evidence of both the paucity of novel, effective prevention strategies that target specific molecular risk pathways, and our inability to implement existing strategies. Major barriers are two-fold: hesitation among healthy women to accept drugs for a disease that they may or may not experience in the future; and their reluctance to experience side effects that impair quality of life and may compromise health. The first of these would be mitigated by improved identification of women at high risk of developing breast cancer, but almost 30 years after the initial publication of the Gail Model, breast cancer risk stratification remains imprecise and insensitive to breast cancer subtype. In an analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative, the Gail Model displayed modest ability to predict the risk of breast cancer (AUC = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.56–0.60). Among women at high risk of breast cancer, for example, those diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, neither the Gail Model/Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool nor the Tyrer-Cuzick Model performed well. This is a significant barrier to implementation of established medical interventions for disease prevention, and to the development of new, targeted intervention strategies for women at risk. Impactful, targeted prevention strategies require knowledge of how breast cancer risk is transduced at the molecular level in the breast itself, i.e. identification of somatic genetic changes that predate breast cancer and influence the biologic profile of cancers that emerge.

### Predicting risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women by hormone receptor status [^112iUsUD]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Strategies for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women require screening of large populations to identify those with potential benefit. We evaluated and attempted to improve the performance of the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (i.e., the Gail model) for estimating invasive breast cancer risk by receptor status in postmenopausal women.

Methods

In The Women's Health Initiative cohort, breast cancer risk estimates from the Gail model and models incorporating additional or fewer risk factors and 5-year incidence of ER-positive and ER-negative invasive breast cancers were determined and compared by use of receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Among 147,916 eligible women, 3236 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The overall AUC for the Gail model was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56 to 0.60). The Gail model underestimated 5-year invasive breast cancer incidence by approximately 20% (P < .001), mostly among those with a low estimated risk. Discriminatory performance was better for the risk of ER-positive cancer (AUC = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.62) than for the risk of ER-negative cancer (AUC = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.54). Age and age at menopause were statistically significantly associated with ER-positive but not ER-negative cancers (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04 for heterogeneity, respectively). For ER-positive cancers, no additional risk factors substantially improved the Gail model prediction. However, a simpler model that included only age, breast cancer in first-degree relatives, and previous breast biopsy examination performed similarly for ER-positive breast cancer prediction (AUC = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.60); postmenopausal women who were 55 years or older with either a previous breast biopsy examination or a family history of breast cancer had a 5-year breast cancer risk of 1.8% or higher.

Conclusions

In postmenopausal women, the Gail model identified populations at increased risk for ER-positive but not ER-negative breast cancers. A model with fewer variables appears to provide a simpler approach for screening for breast cancer risk.

### A comparison of perceived lifetime breast cancer risk to calculated lifetime risk using the gail risk assessment tool [^113fJUJA]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Understanding the accuracy of a woman's perceived breast cancer risk can enhance shared decision-making about breast cancer screening through provider and patient discussion. We aim to report and compare women's perceived lifetime breast cancer risk to calculated lifetime breast cancer risk. Methods: Women presenting to Mayo Clinic in Arizona and Minnesota in July 2016 completed a survey assessing their perceived breast cancer risk. Lifetime Gail risk scores were calculated from questions pertaining to health history and were then compared with perceived breast cancer risk. Results: A total of 550 predominantly white, married, and well-educated (≥ college) women completed surveys. Using lifetime Gail risk scores, 5.6% were classified as high risk (> 20% lifetime risk), 7.7% were classified as intermediate risk (15%-20%), and 86.6% were classified as average risk (< 15%). Of the 27 women who were classified as high risk, 18 (66.7%) underestimated their risk and of the 37 women who were intermediate risk, 12 (32.4%) underestimated risk. Women more likely to underestimate their risk had a reported history of an abnormal mammogram and at least one or more relative with a history of breast cancer. Surveyed women tended to overestimate risk 4.3 (130/30) times as often as they underestimated risk. Conclusion: In a group of predominantly white, educated, and married cohort of women, there was a large portion of women in the elevated risk groups who underestimated risk. Specific aspects of medical history were associated with underestimation including a history of abnormal mammogram and family history of breast cancer. Overall, in our sample, more women overestimated than underestimated risk.

### Breast cancer risk assessment: a guide for clinicians using the NCCN breast cancer risk reduction guidelines [^111VoLXz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Breast cancer, a complex and heterogeneous disease, is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women in the United States, with over 180,000 new cases and approximately 44,000 deaths per year. Breast cancer risk is influenced by a large number of factors, including age, family history, reproductive and hormonal history, proliferative breast conditions, physical activity, diet, and environmental exposures. These factors all interact in a complex manner to contribute to the risk of developing breast cancer. Because the interactions between risk factors are poorly understood at the molecular level, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the breast cancer risk of a given person presenting with an individual constellation of factors. To better define the population at increased risk that may warrant specific intervention, several models exist to estimate a woman's risk for developing breast cancer and for harboring a germline mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene. This article summarizes these models and gives brief guidelines about which model may be preferable given a specific family history.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^115zv7qc]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

NRI is a relatively new statistic but has gained increasing acceptance as an important part of the evaluation of new biomarkers and risk stratifiers. The statistic has also been criticized, for sensitivity to model calibration and dependence on arbitrary cut points. The use of NRI presupposes that classification performance is important, and in that context, sensitivity to calibration could be seen as a feature, not a limitation. In any case, the Gail model is embedded within our combined risk model, so the calibration discrepancy of the Gail model is also present in the combined model. We obtained a similar NRI using recalibrated Gail risk estimates, and we found that the NRI statistic is robust to moderate changes in the cut points.

We also evaluated whether it might be possible to obtain better test performance by focusing on a subset of women at particularly high risk — those with previous breast biopsies. Here, classification improved for only 2.8% of case patients but for 14.8% of control subjects (P = 4.4 × 10 −5). Although this improvement suggests that the combined Gail × SNP risk score might assist in identifying a subset of women with previous biopsies who might not need as aggressive risk reduction and surveillance efforts as their biopsy history suggests, these results should be interpreted with caution and will require further validation in other datasets with available histopathology from the previous biopsies.

Figure 3
Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) for Gail risk, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk, and combined Gail × SNP risk.

We used a reclassification table to assess the assignment of women to low, intermediate, and elevated risk categories. We chose 5-year absolute risk thresholds of 1.5% and 2% (< 1.5% for below average risk, 1.5%–2.0% for intermediate risk, and > 2.0% for elevated risk) and evaluated reclassification for the Gail × SNP risk score vs Gail risk score alone (Table 5). The Gail × SNP risk score assigned more individuals to the tails of the risk distribution: it placed 22% fewer case patients and 29% fewer control subjects in the intermediate 1.5%–2.0% bin compared with the Gail score alone. The NRI for this table was 0.085 (Z = 4.3, P = 1.0 × 10 −5), indicating that these changes are often in the right direction. Classification improved for 5.6% of case patients (P = 4.8 × 10 −5) and 2.9% of control subjects (P = 0.018). Next, we investigated the extent to which reclassification performance might be distorted by poor calibration of the Gail model in the WHI cohort. We used a logistic regression model to fit breast cancer status against the logarithm of the 5-year Gail risk estimate to obtain recalibrated Gail risk estimates. This has no effect on model discrimination, but the Hosmer–Lemeshow test suggested that the scores were now well calibrated (P = 0.87, compared with the previous P = 1.6 × 10 −6). We adjusted the classification cut points to represent the same quantiles on this new risk scale. The NRI for this table was 0.099 (Z = 4.2, P = 1.3 × 10 −5), with improvement for 7.9% of case patients (P = 1.4 × 10 −6) and 2.0% of control subjects (P = 0.11).

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^113NHAfC]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Two previous studies have analyzed the potential impact of adding genetic information from a panel of seven SNPs associated with breast cancer risk to the Gail model. One analysis used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to predict that the area under the curve (AUC) would improve from 0.607 for the Gail model alone, as implemented in the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), to 0.632 when risk information from the seven SNPs was combined with the Gail model (BCRATplus7). In an editorial accompanying that article, Pepe and Janes suggested that ROC curve analysis might not be the most useful method for assessing performance of these models and that reclassification tables would allow the assessment of the fraction of individuals with meaningful improvements in risk prediction. A second analysis showed that real gains, albeit modest, could be achieved in reclassification of risk, under the assumption that the model combining information from the seven SNPs with the Gail model was well calibrated.

In addition, other studies have begun to set modest expectations for potential clinical gains from combining SNP information with clinical risk factors. However, these studies have either been theoretical in nature or they combined model building with evaluation, which may complicate evaluating the results in clinical context. We set out to empirically assess the clinical validity of a prespecified model combining genetic information with risk estimates from the Gail model in a nested case–control study from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial. We also assessed whether the improvement in risk assessment from incorporating genetic information might be larger in subsets of women at intermediate risk based on clinical risk factors. We focused our analyses on white non-Hispanic women because of the combined availability of Gail model validity information and accurate odds ratios for SNPs in this group.

### Long-term performance of an image-based short-term risk model for breast cancer [^114KAABM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Improved breast cancer risk assessment models are needed to enable personalized breast cancer screening and primary prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI)–based models using data from mammograms have been reported to have higher performance than traditional lifestyle/familial-based risk models in estimating the short-term risk of breast cancer. - The long-term performance of image-derived, short-term models is yet to be determined.

Breast cancer risk assessment is currently offered in the United States and is performed using lifestyle/familial-based risk models such as Tyrer-Cuzick and Gail. - Recently, image-based risk models have emerged to refine personalized screening. Such short-term risk tools could identify women who, after a negative or benign screening, might benefit from supplemental or more intensive screening and, identify women who otherwise might be diagnosed with symptomatic (breast cancer diagnosed between two screens) or later-stage breast cancer.

### Development and pilot of an online, personalized risk assessment tool for a breast cancer precision medicine trial [^1144LXpd]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The development of risk models has not led to the uptake of risk-reducing interventions, such as endocrine risk-reduction. Large-scale clinical trials of selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors show benefit in high-risk women for reducing both invasive and non-invasive breast cancer incidence –. However, initial studies of quality of life have significantly underrepresented the significant side-effects of medications, which impact a patient's willingness to consider risk-reduction. These side-effects include menopausal symptoms, thromboembolism, and endometrial cancer risk; recent literature suggests these possibly correlate with dosage –. In addition to risk-reducing medications, several studies have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions also may reduce the risk of breast cancer –.

Risk-reduction strategies are only useful if women are aware that they are estimated to have high risk and benefits outweigh the risk of side-effects. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend the use of clinical risk models to assess women of high risk. Early models were first created by Gail and used in the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. Since then, models such as the Tyrer-Cuzick, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) have enhanced prior models by incorporating mammographic density for their 5- and 10-year risk projections. Model modifications integrating genetic risk have been put into practice –. The BCSC model has been validated in a diverse population of over 1 million women across the United States.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^113XALUZ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

We assessed classification performance of Gail risk, SNP risk, and Gail × SNP risk using ROC curves. Bootstrap resampling (1000 replicates) was used to estimate confidence intervals for AUC as well as empirical P values for differences in AUC. Each bootstrap replicate was formed by selecting at random from the original case patients and control subjects, allowing the same individual to be selected more than once, to obtain the same total numbers of case patients and control subjects. We used the pcvsuite software package to compute age-adjusted ROC curves and AUC values by measuring performance within deciles of the cohort defined by age and averaging these results to obtain values for the entire cohort.

We also evaluated classification accuracy using reclassification tables and quantified differences in classification by net reclassification improvement (NRI). Although reclassification tables are most intuitive in population-based studies, the NRI metric remains useful in case–control studies because it is unaffected by case–control sampling. NRI is the sum of the proportion of case patients moving to a higher-risk category minus the proportion of case patients moving to a lower risk category, and the proportion of control subjects moving to a lower risk category minus the proportion of control subjects moving to a higher-risk category. For simple tests of the hypothesis (NRI = 0), we used an asymptotic Z test. We also used bootstrap resampling to evaluate 95% confidence intervals for NRI and to determine empirical P values for differences in NRI. We used the same bootstrap samples for each classifier and used paired tests to compare classification performance to preserve the correlation structure of the classifiers.

We recently learned (N. Cook, personal communication) that NRI may be biased when calculated within a limited range of risk scores. Where this bias would be relevant, we determined an empirical distribution of NRI under the null hypothesis using permuted risk scores and evaluated statistical significance of the actual NRI by comparison with this distribution.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^112s4rh1]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

This study has several strengths. First, we have taken a rigorous approach to identifying the SNPs to include in the panel; only including those that have been reproducibly associated with breast cancer risk and for which consistent risk estimates have been reported in the literature (5−8). Second, we have genotyped individuals from a large prospectively recruited cohort with meticulous data collection and rigorous ascertainment of relevant breast cancer outcomes. Third, we have used literature-based genetic risk estimates and have combined them in a straightforward fashion to form risk predictors. Importantly, we did not train our predictors on the WHI Clinical Trial data and only used the trial samples to assess their performance.

Our study has a few limitations that include the composition of the WHI Clinical Trial cohort, which limits inferential scope to white non-Hispanic postmenopausal women, and the clinical characteristics of the women therein. For example, individuals within the WHI Clinical Trial received hormone replacement therapy at a higher frequency than women currently do at present. Importantly, the age-matching design inherent to this study does remove one of the Gail model variables and contributes both to the relatively low AUC seen for the Gail model in our analysis and to its poor calibration. In addition, the absence of pathology records for previous breast biopsies in the WHI Clinical Trial required us to estimate individual Gail risks by coding atypical hyperplasia status as unknown for women with prior breast biopsies. Although the incidence of atypical hyperplasia is sufficiently low that it seems unlikely to have affected the analyses of the entire nested case–control study, it is unclear to what extent this may have affected the analyses focusing on the subset of women with one or more previous biopsies. Additionally, case–control sampling means we cannot evaluate calibration of absolute event rates; we can only effectively test the slope of the relationship between expected and observed risk and not the intercept. Therefore, although the WHI Clinical Trial cohort is sufficient to support the validity of the SNP risk and Gail × SNP risk models in predicting breast cancer risk, there is a need for further assessment of the clinical validity of the combined Gail × SNP risk model, especially in population-based cohorts.

### Chemoprevention for breast cancer [^113mHhrM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many women at increased risk for breast cancer could benefit from preventive therapy. Preventive therapy options for breast cancer risk reduction have expanded in the last few years to include both selective receptor modulators (tamoxifen and raloxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole and exemestane).

Methods

Risk factors that place women at high risk for breast cancer, as well as risk calculation models appropriate for the selection of candidates for preventive therapy, are presented, followed by a review of current guidelines for chemoprevention and results of chemoprevention trials.

Results

The modified Gail model or Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is the most widely utilized risk assessment calculator to determine eligibility for chemoprevention. Women most likely to benefit from preventive therapy include those at high risk under the age of 50 years and those with atypical hyperplasia. Physician and patient barriers limit widespread acceptance and adherence to preventive therapy.

Conclusions

Published guidelines on chemoprevention for breast cancer have been updated to increase awareness and encourage discussion between patients and their physicians regarding evidence-based studies evaluating the benefits of preventive options for women at increased risk for breast cancer. However, even with increasing awareness and established benefits of preventive therapy, the uptake of chemoprevention has been low, with both physician and patient barriers identified. It is prudent that these barriers be overcome to enable high-risk women with a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio to be offered chemoprevention to reduce their likelihood of developing hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

The identification of women at higher risk for breast cancer is a matter of public health and anyone who participates in any treatment modality of this condition (this includes the plastic surgeon) should be aware of the tools and predictive models of breast cancer. Screening for breast cancer in the community, and probably during the daily plastic surgery consultation, until recently, was limited to decisions about when to initiate a mammography study. New developments that predict and modify breast cancer risk must be clearly understood by our specialty through identification of women at higher risk for breast cancer and be familiar with the current issues related to screening and risk-reduction measures. In this review, we discuss current knowledge regarding the recent data of breast cancer risk, screening strategies for high-risk women and medical and surgical approaches to reduce breast cancer risk. Patients with breast cancer belong to one of three groups: a. Sporadic breast cancer (75%) — patients without family history or those who have a breast biopsy with proliferative changes. b. Genetic mutation breast cancer (5%) — women who have a genetic predisposition, and most of these are attributable to mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2). c. Cluster family breast cancer (20%) — seen in women with a relevant history of breast cancer in the family and breast biopsy with proliferative breast changes with no association with mutations. Those at high risk for breast cancer should investigate the family history with genetic testing consideration, clinical history, including prior breast biopsies and evaluation of mammographic density. Tools for breast cancer risk assessment include the Gail and Claus model, genetic screening, BRCAPRO and others that are evaluated in this review.

### A systematic review and quality assessment of individualised breast cancer risk prediction models [^113oPyEP]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

The quality of the included studies was moderate due to some limitations in the discriminative power, study design, and data inputs. The studies did not show important limitations with regards to the validation, appropriateness of the model analysis, reporting or interpretation of the results (Fig. 3). A summary of the risk of bias assessment per each source of limitation is presented here and the detailed appraisal and judgements in Supplementary table 4.

Internal and external validation

Ten studies –, validated their models by comparing the results with those published by Gail et al.three studies, compared with Tice et al.onecompared with both Gail et al.and Tyrer et al.onecompared with both Gail et al.and the results of a Rosner & Colditz model external validationand three studies did not report the model validation in the primary articles. Six studies assessed internal validation with a sample of the population that generated data for the model, and four with an external population. Despite not having reported the external validation in the primary articles, the Rosner & Colditz model, reported external validation in a subsequent article mentioned before. Nine studies used the expected/observed event ratio to measure the calibration accuracy of the model.

Bias due to the study design

Thirteen studies used a case-control design to obtain breast cancer risk estimates. five studies used prospective cohorts, and four models used retrospective cohorts.– The study of Wang et al.and the study of Tyrer et al.used risk estimates obtained from a systematic review of the literature.

Limitations of data inputs

Sixteen studies obtained most of the input parameters from self-reported questionnaires. The study of Matsuno et al.also imputed ethnicity for women with missing data.

### Assessment of the accuracy of the gail model in women with atypical hyperplasia [^112MAgBN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

An accurate estimate of a woman's breast cancer risk is essential for optimal patient counseling and management. Women with biopsy-confirmed atypical hyperplasia of the breast (atypia) are at high risk for breast cancer. The Gail model is widely used in these women, but has not been validated in them.

Patients and Methods

Women with atypia were identified from the Mayo Benign Breast Disease (BBD) cohort (1967 to 1991). Their risk factors for breast cancer were obtained, and the Gail model was used to predict 5-year-and follow-up-specific risks for each woman. The predicted and observed numbers of breast cancers were compared, and the concordance between individual risk levels and outcomes was computed.

Results

Of the 9,376 women in the BBD cohort, 331 women had atypia (3.5%). At a mean follow-up of 13.7 years, 58 of 331 (17.5%) patients had developed invasive breast cancer, 1.66 times more than the 34.9 predicted by the Gail model (95% CI, 1.29 to 2.15; P < .001). For individual women, the concordance between predicted and observed outcomes was low, with a concordance statistic of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.55).

Conclusion

The Gail model significantly underestimates the risk of breast cancer in women with atypia. Its ability to discriminate women with atypia into those who did and did not develop breast cancer is limited. Health care professionals should be cautious when using the Gail model to counsel individual patients with atypia.

### Performance of breast cancer risk-assessment models in a large mammography cohort [^111XSA7L]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Several breast cancer risk-assessment models exist. Few studies have evaluated predictive accuracy of multiple models in large screening populations.

Methods

We evaluated the performance of the BRCAPRO, Gail, Claus, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), and Tyrer-Cuzick models in predicting risk of breast cancer over 6 years among 35 921 women aged 40–84 years who underwent mammography screening at Newton-Wellesley Hospital from 2007 to 2009. We assessed model discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and assessed calibration by comparing the ratio of observed-to-expected (O/E) cases. We calculated the square root of the Brier score and positive and negative predictive values of each model.

Results

Our results confirmed the good calibration and comparable moderate discrimination of the BRCAPRO, Gail, Tyrer-Cuzick, and BCSC models. The Gail model had slightly better O/E ratio and AUC (O/E = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 1.06, AUC = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.65) compared with BRCAPRO (O/E = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.02, AUC = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.59 to 0.63) and Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8, O/E = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.79 to 0.91, AUC = 0.62, 95% 0.60 to 0.64) in the full study population, and the BCSC model had the highest AUC among women with available breast density information (O/E = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.05, AUC = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.66). All models had poorer predictive accuracy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive and triple-negative breast cancers than hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancers.

Conclusions

In a large cohort of patients undergoing mammography screening, existing risk prediction models had similar, moderate predictive accuracy and good calibration overall. Models that incorporate additional genetic and nongenetic risk factors and estimate risk of tumor subtypes may further improve breast cancer risk prediction.

### Impact of adding breast density to breast cancer risk models: a systematic review [^116idTdP]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Assessment of a woman's risk of breast cancer is essential when moving towards personalized screening. Breast density is a well-known risk factor and has the potential to improve accuracy of risk prediction models. In this study we reviewed the impact on model performance of adding breast density to clinical breast cancer risk prediction models.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 2007 until November 2019. Studies were screened using the Covidence software. Eligible studies developed or modified existing breast cancer risk prediction models applicable to the general population of women by adding breast density to the model. Improvement in discriminatory accuracy was measured as an increase in the Area Under the Curve or concordance statistics.

Results

Eleven eligible studies were identified by the search and one by reference check. Four studies modified the Gail model, four modified the Tyrer-Cuzick model, and five studies developed new models. Several methods were used to measure breast density, including visual, semi- and fully automated methods. Eleven studies reported discriminatory accuracy and one study reported calibration. Seven studies found a statistically significantly increased discriminatory accuracy when including density in the model. The increase in AUC ranged 0.03 to 0.14. Four studies did not report on statistical significance, but reported an increased AUC ranging from 0.01 to 0.06.

Conclusion

Including mammographic breast density has the potential to improve breast cancer risk prediction models. However, all models demonstrated limited discrimination accuracy.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^113yhnX2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Performance in Women With Previous Breast Biopsies

Because women with previous breast biopsies are at intermediately elevated risk of breast cancer and in particular need of risk stratification to guide future screening and preventative strategies, we also assessed the impact of the Gail × SNP risk score in this subset. Given the loss of an important risk stratifier, the Gail model had an AUC of only 0.514 (95% CI = 0.471 to 0.561) in this subset. The Gail × SNP risk score had an AUC of 0.571 (95% CI = 0.526 to 0.614). We also computed reclassification metrics in the biopsy subset (, available online). In this subset, the NRI is 0.175, which is statistically significant despite the smaller number of events (Z = 3.9, P = 4.9 × 10 −5). The classification improved for only 2.8% of case patients (P = 0.16) but for 14.8% of control subjects (P = 1.5 × 10 −5). We used bootstrap resampling to evaluate whether the difference in NRI between the full cohort, and the biopsy subset was statistically significant. Based on 1000 bootstrap replicates, a 95% confidence interval for the improvement in NRI in the biopsy subset extended from 0.02 to 0.16 (empirical P = 0.03). This increase in NRI is not simply a consequence of conditioning on an important Gail risk factor; in the subset of individuals without a previous breast biopsy, NRI was reduced to 0.065.

Risk Assessment and Tumor ER Status

We evaluated risk assessment among subsets of breast cancer case patients defined by ER status (, available online). Gail risk and Gail × SNP risk were substantially more predictive for ER-positive (Gail risk: P = 1.1 × 10 −9; Gail × SNP risk: P = 2.4 × 10 −22) than for ER-negative tumors (Gail risk: P = 0.89; Gail × SNP risk: P = 0.32) (and, available online). We saw suggestive evidence that an SNP risk model using ER-specific odds ratios may improve performance for ER-negative tumors (improvement in AUC = 0.022, empirical P = 0.10) (, available online).

### Evaluation of the BOADICEA risk assessment model in women with a family history of breast cancer [^117RGjuR]. Familial Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Taken together, the estimated background risk and the observed high incidence of breast cancer cases in women with 17–19.9% life time risk indicate that a cut-off point of 17% for follow-up could be considered.

As opposed to life time risk, each woman's risk for the observation period depended on her age at start of observation. To identify an alternative cut-off point for follow-up, based on the risks for the observation periods, we needed to compensate for that the observation period length differed between individuals. Therefore, an annual risk was calculated for all index persons by dividing each risk for the observation period by the corresponding number of years. Here, we allowed the observation period to be uninterrupted by PM/death/migration in order to mimic a counselling situation at the clinic. An analysis of the annual risk score regarding discrimination between breast cancer and no breast cancer resulted in an AUC of 0.68. If an annual risk score of 0.3% had been used as cut-off point for breast cancer preventive measures in the present study, the numbers of breast cancers in the group below the threshold would have been five, similar to the estimated background risk. The distribution of observed breast cancers, including DCIS, over four intervals of annual risk is shown in Fig. 3 and the number of women per interval in Table 4. It was demonstrated that with a cut-off point of 0.3% annual risk 210 women would not have been offered follow-up at the time of risk assessment. An annual risk level of 0.33% coincides with a five-year risk of 1.67% (as estimated by the Gail model 2) which is accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration as a cut-off point for segregating high- and low-risk individuals.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^1167et2m]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

A number of tools and calculators are used to estimate lifetime invasive breast cancer risk, but not necessarily the predicted age of onset (See Table 2 in Appendix 4, for a comparison of four commonly used risk-assessment models: Tyrer-Cuzick, the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm, Claus, and the modified Gail model, also called the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool).

Numerous national consensus guidelines and recommendations have been developed to assist health care providers in communicating with patients about referral to genetic counseling or testing for early-onset breast cancer genes or both. Some specialty societies have produced separate guidance specifically addressing both the interpretation of genetic test results and how to communicate these results to patients. Some guidelines are frequently updated, whereas others are periodically revised (ie, every few years), resulting in guidance that may differ, causing confusion among health care providers and patients. All current guidelines recommend that women should be screened for personal and family history of breast and other related cancers and referred for genetic counseling or testing or both as appropriate. In addition, all guidelines recommend that determination for testing and pretest and posttest counseling should be performed by individuals with appropriate training. However, there is a shortage of genetic counselors in the United States, which has been identified as a barrier to effective counseling, (see Appendix 4 for complete evidence summary).

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^115RYFTM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Additional widely validated models to assess cancer risk include the Tyrer-Cuzick, modified Gail, and Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium models. None specifically assess risk of early-onset or premenopausal breast cancer, although most provide estimated 5- or 10-year cancer risk as well as lifetime risk of breast cancer. No models used validation cohorts with patients younger than 20 years. The modified Gail model has been validated in women 35 years and older to assess 5-year invasive cancer risk. The Tyrer-Cuzick model has been studied in women older than age 20 years to assess 10-year cancer risk and has been shown to perform better in women with a family history of breast cancer. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk calculator is validated for women older than age 35 years to provide 5- and 10-year risks and includes family history factors as well as breast density in the calculation. There are limited data on the use of these models to specifically address cancer risk reduction in young women.

Family history should be collected and updated periodically to identify patients who may be at increased risk of predisposing genetic mutations. Tools that may aid in collecting family history are the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, Manchester Scoring System, Referral Screening Tool, Pedigree Assessment Tool, and FHS-7. There is no evidence to recommend one method over another. Those who screen positive or who meet published guidelines for qualifying family histories should be referred for genetic counseling and testing.

There are no guidelines or best practices for identifying risk factors or for the use of tools to estimate risk specific to early-onset breast cancer. However, multiple organizations provide guidance for assessing risk of breast cancer in general.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advocates use of brief familial assessment tools to assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed six tools that were adequately validated, but found insufficient evidence to recommend one tool over another. Other organizations likewise do not advocate for use of any specific tool.–

### Breast cancer risk assessment in 64, 659 women at a single high-volume mammography clinic [^1149LpDf]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In 2007, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommended that women at elevated risk of breast cancer be screened with breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an adjunct to mammography. This study estimates the proportion of women presenting for screening mammography who are at elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer as determined by the Gail model. This study provides preliminary information for a proposed follow-up study, including the proportion of women who completed the recommended MRI at the same clinic that had conducted the risk assessment.

Materials and Methods

This study is an observational prospective cohort of 64,659 women presenting for mammographic screening at a single high-volume clinic. If a woman reported a first-degree maternal relative with breast cancer and had at least 20% lifetime risk on the Gail model, the radiologist's report included a recommendation that the primary care physician refer the woman for breast MRI screening. Records were examined to determine if women completed the recommended MRI at the clinic within one year of the initial risk assessment.

Results

Of 64,659 women, 1,246 (1.9%) had a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 20% or greater, and 436 (0.7%) had a lifetime risk of breast cancer 25% or greater. Of the women at elevated risk, 173 (13.9%) completed the recommended breast MRI screening at the clinic within a year.

Conclusion

The effectiveness of matching screening intensity to risk on cancer detection, biopsy rate, and cost should be evaluated by studying multiple clinics and multiple risk assessment tools.

### How do we increase uptake of tamoxifen and other anti-estrogens for breast cancer prevention? [^112Qk9yr]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Who is eligible for breast cancer preventive therapy?

The Gail breast cancer risk assessment tool (BCRAT), easily accessible at no cost on-line, is the most commonly used tool to estimate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. This tool was used to determine eligibility for breast cancer preventive therapy in the North American prevention trials. It incorporates current age, age at menarche, age at first live birth, race/ethnicity, first-degree family history of breast cancer, and the presence of benign breast disease, including atypical hyperplasia. Eligibility for chemoprevention included women aged ≥ 60 years or those with a 5-year invasive breast cancer risk greater than1.67% or lifetime risk greater than 20%. The European prevention trials used the Tyrer-Cuzick model, which incorporates genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk factors including a more extensive family history, to determine eligibility for pharmacologic prevention. For the International Breast cancer Intervention Studies of tamoxifen (IBIS-I) and anastrozole (IBIS-II), women who had a 10-year risk of breast cancer according to the Tyrer-Cuzick model of 5% or greater were eligible to enroll. Both the Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick models have been cited as inadequate for risk assessment. The Tyrer-Cuzick model overestimates risk of cancer in women with breast atypia. The Gail model has been well-validated at the population level, and has been updated for more sensitive risk estimates in African Americanand Asian American populations. However, few studies have used this model in Hispanic populations. Other breast cancer risk models, such as Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPRO, and BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm), may be used to estimate risk in women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer.

### Gail model for prediction of absolute risk of invasive breast cancer: independent evaluation in the florence-European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition cohort [^116sCPeY]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The Gail model 2 (GM) for predicting the absolute risk of invasive breast cancer has been used for counseling and to design intervention studies. Although the GM has been validated in US populations, its performance in other populations is unclear because of the wide variation in international breast cancer rates.

Methods

We used data from a multicenter case-control study in Italy and from Italian cancer registries to develop a model (IT-GM) that uses the same risk factors as the GM. We evaluated the accuracy of the IT-GM and the GM using independent data from the Florence-European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. To assess model calibration (i.e., how well the model predicts the observed numbers of events in subsets of the population), we compared the number of expected incident breast cancers (E) predicted by these models with the number of observed incident breast cancers (O), and we computed the concordance statistic to measure discriminatory accuracy.

Results

The overall E/O ratios were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84 to 1.11) and 0.93 (95% CI = 0.81 to 1.08) for the IT-GM and the GM, respectively. The IT-GM was somewhat better calibrated than GM in women younger than 50 years, but the GM was better calibrated when age at first live birth categories were considered (e.g., 20- to 24-year age-at-first-birth category E/O = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.94 for the IT-GM and E/O = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.03 for the GM). The concordance statistic was approximately 59% for both models, with 95% confidence intervals indicating that the models perform statistically significantly better than pure chance (concordance statistic of 50%).

Conclusions

There was no statistically significant evidence of miscalibration overall for either the IT-GM or the GM, and the models had equivalent discriminatory accuracy. The good performance of the IT-GM when applied on the independent data from the Florence-EPIC cohort indicates that GM can be improved for use in populations other than US populations. Our findings suggest that the Italian data may be useful for revising the GM to include additional risk factors for breast cancer.

### Prospective breast cancer risk prediction model for women undergoing screening mammography [^113W3Un2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Risk prediction models for breast cancer can be improved by the addition of recently identified risk factors, including breast density and use of hormone therapy. We used prospective risk information to predict a diagnosis of breast cancer in a cohort of 1 million women undergoing screening mammography.

Methods

There were 2,392,998 eligible screening mammograms from women without previously diagnosed breast cancer who had had a prior mammogram in the preceding 5 years. Within 1 year of the screening mammogram, 11,638 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Separate logistic regression risk models were constructed for premenopausal and postmenopausal examinations by use of a stringent (P < .0001) criterion for the inclusion of risk factors. Risk models were constructed with 75% of the data and validated with the remaining 25%. Concordance of the predicted with the observed outcomes was assessed by a concordance (c) statistic after logistic regression model fit. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Statistically significant risk factors for breast cancer diagnosis among premenopausal women included age, breast density, family history of breast cancer, and a prior breast procedure. For postmenopausal women, the statistically significant factors included age, breast density, race, ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, a prior breast procedure, body mass index, natural menopause, hormone therapy, and a prior false-positive mammogram. The model may identify high-risk women better than the Gail model, although predictive accuracy was only moderate. The c statistics were 0.631 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.618 to 0.644) for premenopausal women and 0.624 (95% CI = 0.619 to 0.630) for postmenopausal women.

Conclusion

Breast density is a strong additional risk factor for breast cancer, although it is unknown whether reduction in breast density would reduce risk. Our risk model may be able to identify women at high risk for breast cancer for preventive interventions or more intensive surveillance.

### Breast cancer risk assessment in 8, 824 women attending a family history evaluation and screening programme [^115z1WrQ]. Familial Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate individualized breast cancer risk assessment is essential to provide risk-benefit analysis prior to initiating interventions designed to lower breast cancer risk and start surveillance. We have previously shown that a manual adaptation of Claus tables was as accurate as the Tyrer-Cuzick model and more accurate at predicting breast cancer than the Gail, Claus model and Ford models. Here we reassess the manual model with longer follow up and higher numbers of cancers. Calibration of the manual model was assessed using data from 8,824 women attending the family history evaluation and screening programme in Manchester UK, with a mean follow up of 9.71 years. After exclusion of 40 prevalent cancers, 406 incident breast cancers occurred, and 385.1 were predicted (O/E = 1.05, 95% CI 0.95–1.16) using the manual model. Predictions were close to that of observed cancers in all risk categories and in all age groups, including women in their forties (O/E = 0.99, 95% CI 0.83–1.16). Manual risk prediction with use of adjusted Claus tables and curves with modest adjustment for hormonal and reproductive factors was a well-calibrated approach to breast cancer risk estimation in a UK family history clinic.

### Critical assessment of new risk factors for breast cancer: considerations for development of an improved risk prediction model [^1138HYCt]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of candidates for breast cancer prevention have not accepted tamoxifen because of the perception of an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio and the acceptance of raloxifene remains to be determined. One means of improving this ratio is to identify women at very high risk of breast cancer. Family history, age, atypia in a benign biopsy, and reproductive factors are the main parameters currently used to determine risk. The most powerful risk factor, mammographic density, is not presently employed routinely. Other potentially important factors are plasma estrogen and androgen levels, bone density, weight gain, age of menopause, and fracture history, which are also not currently used in a comprehensive risk prediction model because of lack of prospective validation. The Breast Cancer Prevention Collaborative Group (BCPCG) met to critically examine and prioritize risk factors that might be selected for further testing by multivariate analysis using existing clinical material. The BCPCG reached a consensus that quantitative breast density, state of the art plasma estrogen and androgen measurements, history of fracture and height loss, BMI, and waist-hip ratio had sufficient priority for further testing. As a practical approach, these parameters could be added to the existing Tyrer-Cuzick model which encompasses factors included in both the Claus and Gail models. The BCPCG analyzed potentially available clinical material from previous prospective studies and determined that a large case/control study to evaluate these new factors might be feasible at this time.

### Overlap of high-risk individuals predicted by family history, and genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk prediction models: implications for risk stratification [^111DWFQj]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-genetic risk prediction models are attractive as they are non-invasive and are easier to implement in a general population or primary care screening setting. Currently, breast cancer risk prediction is predominantly based on information on age, family history, lifestyle, and reproductive factors. These data can be collected at a low cost. There is evidence that genetics contribute to risk prediction but the data generation will incur additional costs to individuals or the health system. Hence, there is a need to evaluate how much information genetics can add to the identification of high-risk individuals over non-genetic risk factors. In this case-only analysis involving 7600 Asian breast cancer patients, we look at the overlap of individuals with a family history of breast cancer and those identified to be at high risk based on family history, the Gail model, breast cancer predisposition genes, and polygenic risk score.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^112SRnX6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Subjects and Methods

Ascertainment of Case Patients and Control Subjects

Of 68 132 participants, we identified 2166 women who developed invasive breast cancer between random assignment (September 1, 1993, to December 31, 1998) and the originally planned end of the intervention phase (March 31, 2005) of the WHI Clinical Trial. We matched one control subject without a cancer diagnosis for each case patient for baseline age at enrollment in the WHI Clinical Trial, self-reported ethnicity, trial intervention (hormone replacement therapy, dietary modification, or calcium and vitamin D supplementation), years since trial randomization, and whether or not they had had a hysterectomy. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, and the study was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's Institutional Review Board. Participants in the WHI Clinical Trial had an opportunity to opt in or out of any collaboration involving commercial entities because some women may prefer not to participate in research involving commercial (as opposed to nonprofit) entities. We restricted our analyses to the subset of these case patients and control subjects that had consented for collaborations involving commercial entities. Approximately, 84% of all eligible case patients and control subjects provided such consent. The interventions used in the WHI Clinical Trial are independent of baseline genetic and clinical risk factors by study design, so the analyses presented here were not stratified by trial intervention. In this nested case–control study, we focused our analyses on 3300 white non-Hispanic women, representing 87% of the matched case patients and control subjects.

Estimation of Gail Risk Score

We used the Gail model to estimate the 5-year absolute risk of breast cancer ("Gail risk") based on age, ethnicity, age at menarche, age at birth of first child, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, and the number of previous breast biopsies. We did not have information on biopsy histopathology (ie, whether atypical hyperplasia was present), and this was coded as "unknown". We computed Gail risk for the subjects using a reimplementation of the current BCRAT version 2, based on program source code downloaded from the National Cancer Institute Web site on August 7, 2008.

### How do we increase uptake of tamoxifen and other anti-estrogens for breast cancer prevention? [^112YbNkn]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to concerns about toxicities, another major barrier to uptake of anti-estrogens for preventive therapy is a robust risk assessment model that accurately estimates patient risk. The Gail model is the most widely used risk assessment model, but its accuracy may be limited by patient ethnicity and consideration of first-degree relatives only when evaluating family history of cancer. The Tyrer-Cuzick model, is not one that is familiar to most PCPs. Only 18% of PCPs report use of the on-line Gail model to estimate a patient's breast cancer risk. Different medical specialties vary widely in their use of the Gail model (33–37% for internal medicine and family medicine compared to 60% for gynecology) and ever prescribing anti-estrogens (8–9% for internal medicine and family medicine compared to 30% for gynecology). Additional barriers to routine breast cancer risk assessment include time constraints, lack of familiarity and comfort prescribing preventive therapy. Physician recommendation and effective communication strongly influence uptake of preventive therapy for breast cancer. Providers who were less informed about breast cancer risk-reducing options were less than half as likely to prescribe a SERM than those who felt sufficiently trained.

For women with relevant family or personal histories, primary care clinicians "may use appropriate brief familial risk assessment tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling", with tools evaluated by the USPSTF including the "Ontario Family History Assessment Tool", "Manchester Scoring System", "Referral Screening Tool", "Pedigree Assessment Tool", "7-Question Family History Screening Tool", "International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (Tyrer-Cuzick)", and "brief versions of BRCAPRO". "Each of these tools has been validated and accurately estimate the likelihood of carrying a harmful BRCA1/2 mutation" and "can be used to guide referrals to genetic counseling for more definitive risk assessment". In contrast, "General breast cancer risk assessment models (eg, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which is based on the Gail model) are not designed to identify BRCA-related cancer risk and should not be used for this purpose".

### Variability among breast cancer risk classification models when applied at the level of the individual woman [^116k6anh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and extent of disagreement of three common clinical risk models at the individual level when using these two different cutoffs (≥ 1.67% and ≥ 3.0%) to define high risk of breast cancer at 5 years. We focused on the models most likely to be used across all clinical specialties including, importantly, primary care and general internal medicine providers. The three risk models evaluated in this paper are the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT, also called the Gail model), the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), and the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS, also called the Tyrer-Cuzick model). The BCRAT and IBIS are thought to be the two most commonly used models in clinical practice in the United States. Moreover, these three models all have readily accessible simple online calculators and are recommended for use in primary care. In addition to assessing inter-model disagreement at the level of the individual, we used a subset of women with long-term cancer outcomes from cancer registry linkage to assess the accuracy of the risk models, as well as model calibration and discrimination at the population level.

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113xYDUR]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer risk assessment models — The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 25 good- and fair-quality studies on 18 risk stratification models (n > 5 000 000). Although these models demonstrate good calibration for predicting risk in a population, their discriminatory accuracy to correctly classify individual women who will develop breast cancer over the next 5 years from those who will not is modest at best; the C statistic for most models ranged from 0.55 to 0.65. Models that include breast density, postmenopausal hormone use, and a more extensive family history minimally improve predictive estimates. Most models reported performance slightly better than age alone as a risk predictor, and no studies evaluated optimal ages or frequencies for risk assessment.

For women whose risk factors are not described in the above examples, the Gail Model is necessary to estimate absolute breast cancer risk. Health Care Professionals can obtain a Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool by dialing 1–888–838–2872.

There are insufficient data available regarding the effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer incidence in women with inherited mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2) to be able to make specific recommendations on the effectiveness of tamoxifen citrate in these patients.

After an assessment of the risk of developing breast cancer, the decision regarding therapy with tamoxifen for the reduction in breast cancer incidence should be based upon an individual assessment of the benefits and risks of tamoxifen citrate therapy. In the NSABP P-1 trial, tamoxifen treatment lowered the risk of developing breast cancer during the follow-up period of the trial, but did not eliminate breast cancer risk (see Table 3 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Breast cancer risk assessment: positive predictive value of family history as a predictor of risk [^114p2BY6]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the practical usefulness of family history as a tool for breast cancer risk assessment.

Methods

Women from the Raloxifene Use for The Heart trial (N = 10,048), which consisted of postmenopausal women with or at high risk for coronary artery disease, were included in this post hoc analysis. The breast cancer risk score at baseline was calculated using the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment tool. The positive predictive value of family history as a predictor of risk was determined for several risk thresholds.

Results

Almost all (99.6%) women with a family history of breast cancer are found to be at high risk using the National Cancer Institute's accepted cutoff point of at least 1.66%, and almost 98% of women with a family history of breast cancer belong to the high-risk group when the cutoff point for risk score is 2%.

Conclusions

Family history alone as a high-risk predictor is associated with a high positive predictive value at commonly used cutoff points based on the risk estimates from the traditional Gail model. Although more complex models of breast cancer risk should still be used as the standard for assessment, screening using family history seems to be a first step in beginning the discussion with women.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^115W99R5]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The major finding from this nested case–control cohort from the WHI Clinical Trial is that genetic risk information may be combined multiplicatively with Gail risk scores to improve breast cancer risk estimation in postmenopausal white non-Hispanic women. This finding is based both on the observation that breast cancer risk may be accurately estimated by combining published SNP risk estimates and also the observation that correlation between SNP risk scores and Gail risk for individuals is weak, allowing breast cancer risk to be more accurately estimated by combining SNP risk and Gail risk multiplicatively. Thus, this study supports the claim that the combined risk estimation model approach has clinical validity in the broad sense in postmenopausal white non-Hispanic women.

The calibration and discrimination of the Gail model in the WHI cohort are known to be somewhat worse than those seen in other large studies. This is likely because of a combination of factors, including higher mammography rates, differences in age distributions, and changes in breast biopsy procedures, with more common use of image-guided percutaneous core biopsy procedures that have a lower threshold for use than open biopsy. The lack of data on atypical hyperplasia may also contribute to lower calibration and discrimination in the WHI cohort. Additionally, as the WHI Clinical Trial tested the impact of hormone replacement therapy on breast cancer risk, a higher percentage of women in our case–control cohort may have received hormone replacement therapy than in the studies in which the Gail model was previously validated. Last, the age matching in our nested case–control study is likely to have contributed to the reduced performance of the Gail model because age plays a substantial role in that model. This limitation does not directly affect our assessment of independence and calibration of the SNP risk scores but may affect the quantitative metrics of improvement in risk assessment in the combined model. Reclassification performance is sensitive to model calibration as well as discrimination, and it will need to be further characterized in population-based cohorts.

### Effect of an educational intervention on women's health care provider knowledge gaps about breast cancer risk model use and high-risk screening recommendations [^112uBp9S]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess effectiveness of a web-based educational intervention on women's health care provider knowledge of breast cancer risk models and high-risk screening recommendations.

Methods

A web-based pre- and post-test study including 177 U.S.-based women's health care providers was conducted in 2019. Knowledge gaps were defined as fewer than 75% of respondents answering correctly. Pre- and post-test knowledge differences (McNemar test) and associations of baseline characteristics with pre-test knowledge gaps (logistic regression) were evaluated.

Results

Respondents included 131/177 (74.0%) physicians; 127/177 (71.8%) practiced obstetrics/gynecology. Pre-test, 118/177 (66.7%) knew the Gail model predicts lifetime invasive breast cancer risk; this knowledge gap persisted post-test [(121/177, 68.4%); P = 0.77]. Just 39.0% (69/177) knew the Gail model identifies women eligible for risk-reducing medications; this knowledge gap resolved. Only 48.6% (86/177) knew the Gail model should not be used to identify women meeting high-risk MRI screening guidelines; this deficiency decreased to 66.1% (117/177) post-test (P = 0.001). Pre-test, 47.5% (84/177) knew the Tyrer-Cuzick model is used to identify women meeting high-risk screening MRI criteria, 42.9% (76/177) to predict BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutation risk, and 26.0% (46/177) to predict lifetime invasive breast cancer risk. These knowledge gaps persisted but improved. For a high-risk 30-year-old, 67.8% (120/177) and 54.2% (96/177) pre-test knew screening MRI and mammography/tomosynthesis are recommended, respectively; 19.2% (34/177) knew both are recommended; and 53% (94/177) knew US is not recommended. These knowledge gaps resolved or reduced.

Conclusion

Web-based education can reduce important provider knowledge gaps about breast cancer risk models and high-risk screening recommendations.

### Assessment of clinical validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information [^114N5qX3]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Calibration of the SNP Risk Score

To assess calibration of the SNP risk score, we used the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, which compares expected and observed counts of case patients and control subjects in deciles of risk (, available online). As shown in Figure 2, the SNP risk score appeared to be well calibrated (P = 0.18). The Gail risk score, however, was not well calibrated (P = 1.6 × 10 −6), and this lack of calibration carried over to the Gail × SNP risk score to an intermediate extent (P = 0.003). These results were consistent with our analysis using a logistic regression model, where a twofold increase in Gail risk showed only a 1.38-fold increase in cancer incidence (Table 4). The relatively poor calibration of the Gail risk score is consistent with a previous report from the WHI observational study. We did not observe an improvement in calibration in the subset of women with no missing observations for Gail risk factors.

### Machine learning-based lifetime breast cancer risk reclassification compared with the BOADICEA model: impact on screening recommendations [^113aH3oS]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Age over 50 years is the sole risk factor considered for entering a population-based screening programme. However, about 25% of all breast cancers are diagnosed in younger women. Moreover, mammography is less effective as a screening tool for younger women, who are more likely to have dense breast tissue, compromising the efficiency of routine mammograms in this age group. This contributes to diagnostic delays and increased morbidity and mortality. In the era of personalised medicine, a screening strategy based on individual breast cancer risk may improve the benefit–harm ratio of mammography, and increase the efficiency of screening programmes. Many medical societies and professional groups proposed that risk-based screening would be more effective, less morbid and more cost-effective.–

Although many models are used to predict breast cancer risk, such as the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT, also referred as the Gail model), the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS) model, the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA model), – no consistent model has been incorporated into routine clinical practice and/or screening programmes due to limited discriminatory accuracy and applicability. The discriminatory ability, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve, of these models is between 0.53 and 0.64.– A comprehensive risk prediction model with an improved discriminatory power to classify women into clinically meaningful risk groups will enable targeting high-risk women, while reducing interventions in those at low risk.

Machine-learning (ML) algorithms offer an alternative approach to standard prediction modelling that may address current limitations and improve the accuracy of breast cancer prediction models. A series of ML techniques, including our own work, have been developed and used in breast cancer prediction and prognosis, demonstrating that the application of ML methods could improve the prediction accuracy of cancer susceptibility, recurrence and survival models. – Previous studies presented the discriminatory accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and calibration performance of different ML algorithms. However, clinical utility, in terms of potential clinical consequences of using new ML prediction models, is rarely examined. The objective of the current study is to assess the impact of using ML-based breast cancer risk prediction on screening practices. Using data from a large clinical population, we quantified performance measure and reclassification of lifetime breast cancer risk generated from ML algorithms and from the BOADICEA model. We also examined the clinical impact of reclassification of breast cancer risk on screening practices based on the Swiss Surveillance Protocol.

### Breast cancer risk assessment models and high-risk screening [^1142tYDG]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that patients at high risk for breast cancer may benefit by following breast cancer screening paradigms that are more robust than those recommended for the average-risk population. Assessing individual cancer risk and using guidelines to determine if a patient is a candidate for genetic counseling and possibly genetic testing are essential components to comprehensive breast cancer screening.

### Perceived risk of breast cancer among women at average and increased risk [^114o7cLf]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The accuracy of a woman's perception of her risk of developing breast cancer has gained importance as more options for primary prevention have become available for those at increased risk. Conversely, women at average risk who perceive themselves as at increased risk may suffer from avoidable anxiety or unnecessary treatment. This study examined characteristics associated with perception of breast cancer risk among women at average and increased risk.

Methods

We included 1700 women 40–74 years old without a history of breast cancer. The outcome variable was a woman's perceived lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. The Gail model was used to categorize a woman's actual risk as average or high. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to model a woman's perception that her risk was (1) higher than average for those whose Gail score indicated average risk (< 1.67% 5-year risk) and (2) accurate for those whose Gail score indicated increased risk (≥ 1.67% 5-year risk).

Results

Of women at average risk, 72%, but only 43% of those at high risk, accurately perceived their risk. Among women at average risk, those who were younger, had a family history of breast cancer, had no history of childbirth, or had more frequent exposure to lay media information about breast health were more likely than women without these characteristics to overestimate their future risk. Among women at increased risk, younger women and those with a family history of breast cancer were more likely than women without these characteristics to accurately perceive their increased risk. African American women were less likely than white women to accurately perceive their risk.

Conclusions

A majority of women at high risk of developing breast cancer underestimate their risk, and a substantial proportion of women at average risk perceive they are at increased risk.

### An optimization framework to guide the choice of thresholds for risk-based cancer screening [^116M3MoT]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we developed and applied an optimization algorithm to help evaluate risk-based screening thresholds. It may be used to establish when risk models are good enough for health gains to be theoretically possible from risk-stratified screening compared to the current screening programmes. The framework could be used for other breast cancer risk models by using estimates of their distribution of risk in the population. It could be applied to other cancer types by adapting the model for advanced cancer incidence. It is intended as a first step to help define risk-based strategies that have the greatest chance of success on reducing the population health burden of cancer, that would be considered further in health-economic modelling and real-world evaluations.

### Overlap of high-risk individuals predicted by family history, and genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk prediction models: implications for risk stratification [^117HoDxV]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Due to the small number of events within 5 years of recruitment, we studied all breast cancer patients ignoring time to event. The proportion of patients with above 1.3% 5-year absolute risk by PRS (in SCHS's breast cancer patients) was higher than that observed in SGBCC and MyBrCa's patients (SCHS = 41%, SGBCC + MyBrCa = 36%) (Additional file 2 – Fig. S5). However, the proportion of patients with above 1.3% 5-year absolute risk by the Gail model was lower (SCHS = 7%, SGBCC + MyBrCa = 21%).

Identifying women (with no personal history of breast cancer, n = 10,213) at above 1.3% 5-year absolute risk by PRS resulted in a larger proportion of high-risk women (n = 2761, 27%) as compared to using the Gail model (6%) (Additional file 2 – Fig. S5). However, 6% (n = 172, of 2761) of these high-risk women identified by PRS developed breast cancer, which was similar to the 5% (n = 28, of 587) by the Gail model, and 6% (n = 11, of 180) by family history. Adding PRS to risk stratification identified 165 more breast cancer cases. Figure 4 shows the percentage of women identified as high risk by adding the Gail model and PRS to family history across different age groups. The Gail model identified up to 10% more high-risk individuals, while PRS identified an additional ~27% on top of the Gail model and family history.

### Evaluation of breast cancer risk assessment packages in the family history evaluation and screening programme [^113SKfAh]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accurate individualised breast cancer risk assessment is essential to provide risk-benefit analysis prior to initiating interventions designed to lower breast cancer risk. Several mathematical models for the estimation of individual breast cancer risk have been proposed. However, no single model integrates family history, hormonal factors, and benign breast disease in a comprehensive fashion. A new model by Tyrer and Cuzick has addressed these deficiencies. Therefore, this study has assessed the goodness of fit and discriminatory value of the Tyrer-Cuzick model against established models namely Gail, Claus, and Ford.

Methods

The goodness of fit and discriminatory accuracy of the models was assessed using data from 1933 women attending the Family History Evaluation and Screening Programme, of whom 52 developed cancer. All models were applied to these women over a mean follow up of 5.27 years to estimate risk of breast cancer.

Results

The ratios (95% confidence intervals) of expected to observed numbers of breast cancers were 0.48 (0.37 to 0.64) for Gail, 0.56 (0.43 to 0.75) for Claus, 0.49 (0.37 to 0.65) for Ford, and 0.81 (0.62 to 1.08) for Tyrer-Cuzick. The accuracy of the models for individual cases was evaluated using ROC curves. These showed that the area under the curve was 0.735 for Gail, 0.716 for Claus, 0.737 for Ford, and 0.762 for Tyrer-Cuzick.

Conclusion

The Tyrer-Cuzick model is the most consistently accurate model for prediction of breast cancer. The Gail, Claus, and Ford models all significantly underestimate risk, although the accuracy of the Claus model may be improved by adjustments for other risk factors.

### Do traditional gail model risk factors account for increased breast cancer in women with lupus? [^114QZwYn]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine to what extent the observed experience of breast cancer in a combined cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be explained by the profile of breast cancer risk factors.

Methods

Data were pooled from 2 centers, the Montreal General Hospital and the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago. For each female cohort member, the probability of developing breast cancer during followup was estimated based on factors (including the individual's age, parity, age at first live birth, age of menarche, personal history of benign breast disease, and family history) using the Gail model, an established model for predicting breast cancer risk. The actual occurrence of cancer cases was determined by linkage with regional cancer registries.

Results

Of the 583 women in the combined cohort, 5 had been diagnosed with breast cancer prior to cohort entry, and 14 declined participation. In those remaining, 12 cases of breast cancer occurred compared to 5.6 predicted by the Gail model (standardized incidence ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 3.7). Thus, after controlling for risk factors, the incidence of breast cancer was elevated.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that the risk of breast cancer in our SLE cohort is not completely explained by traditional factors found in the Gail model. Other factors, such as carcinogenic exposures (i.e., alkylating agents and immunosuppressive drugs) or the immunologic dysregulation of SLE itself, may be contributory.

### Overlap of high-risk individuals predicted by family history, and genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk prediction models: implications for risk stratification [^111dNLMv]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The main strength of our study is that this is one of the largest and most well-characterized breast cancer cohorts of Asian women. However, many of the breast cancer risk assessment tools and the PRS are established based on European populations and their utility in Asian breast cancer populations remains unclear. Approximately half of the breast cancer population were identified as high risk, suggesting that other factors not considered in the risk prediction models (e.g. mammographic density, physical activity, alcohol, smoking) studied may be responsible. We classified breast cancer patients into risk categories based on 5-year absolute risks at the age of breast cancer diagnosis; this may not be representative of women without breast cancer. While we are likely to overestimate the 5-year absolute risk, results from the prospective cohort (SCHS) support the use of genetic factors on top of family history and the Gail model. As this is a case-only cohort, the proportions from the risk classification analysis are not representative of the general population, where most women will be classified as low risk. Nonetheless, this will not affect the comparison of how different criteria identify women at high risk.

While this study's main focus was to highlight the lack of an overlap between high-risk women identified by genetic and non-genetic risk factors, it is worth noting that other works in the field have studied the potential improvements in risk prediction by combining different risk factors. For instance, Choudhury et al. explored the value of adding mammographic density and PRS to classical risk factors in a population of women of European ancestry. In a more recent study, Yang et al. assessed the performance of breast cancer risk prediction models incorporating genetic and non-genetic risk factors in 20,444 breast cancer cases and 106,450 controls from the Asia Breast Cancer Consortium. These developments are complementary to the findings of this study and will help pave the way for more patient-centric, data-driven healthcare systems in the future.

### Evaluation of the BOADICEA risk assessment model in women with a family history of breast cancer [^116V2fMw]. Familial Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Finally, 96% of the women had annual breast examinations, 3% had mammography every second year and 1% were not monitored due to migration or death. Intensive surveillance and breast cancer diagnosis at PM confer a lead time bias that contributes to a higher number of observed than expected invasive breast cancers and to the significant underestimation of breast cancer when DCIS are included among the observed cases. It has been suggested that the incidence of DCIS can be adjusted by adding 10 years to age at diagnosis, assuming that the DCIS would have become invasive during that time. If so, none of 'our' five observed DCIS would have been accounted for, since observation periods were shorter than 10 years. The demonstrated underestimation of breast cancer risk when DCIS was included among observed breast cancers is in accordance with that the model was developed for invasive breast cancers, not DCIS.

The ability of BOADICEA to distinguish individuals who were diagnosed with breast cancer (invasive or DCIS) from those who were not — on the basis of each individual's risk for the observation period — was investigated. An AUC of 0.63 indicated a clinical usefulness. This value was lower than the corresponding values reported for the Gail (0.74), Claus (0.72), Ford (0.74) and Tyrer–Cuzick (0.76) risk assessment methods, which were evaluated in a British cohort.

In Swedish oncogenetic clinics there are ongoing discussions regarding at what breast cancer risk level surveillance beyond general mammography screening should be offered. It has been suggested that a life time risk of 20% according to BOADICEA should indicate follow-up and that a life time risk of 17–19.9% should lead to an individualized assessment. In the present cohort BOADICEA was used to retrospectively calculate life time risks (20–80 years). It was demonstrated that the proportion of breast cancer in the groups with < 17% and 17–19.9% life time risk was 1.8 and 5.4% respectively, compared to 6.7% in the group " ≥ 20% life time risk/previous breast cancer". The corresponding age-adjusted risk in Swedish women in general with a life time risk of 10%, was 0.9%, or 5.5 breast cancer cases. Four of the observed breast cancers were diagnosed in women with a life time breast cancer risk of less than 17%.

### Overlap of high-risk individuals predicted by family history, and genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk prediction models: implications for risk stratification [^1125Kbti]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Gail model

Data on breast cancer risk factors (age at menarche, age at first live birth, ever had a biopsy, and family history of breast cancer) were obtained from structured questionnaires. Family history of breast cancer was available as a binary variable (yes/no). Weights (logistic regression coefficients derived from the Gail model) and attributable risks of Asian-Americans ("Asian. AABCS", BCRA package in R) were used in the calculation of the Gail model absolute risk.

Five-year absolute risk

Five-year absolute risk at the age of breast cancer diagnosis, for both PRS and the Gail model relative risk, was estimated for breast cancer patients aged between 30 and 75 from SGBCC and MyBrCa. The absolute risk was based on ethnic-specific or overall breast cancer incidence rates (period of 2013 to 2017) for Singapore Citizens and mortality rates (the year 2016) in Singapore (Additional file 3). Both incidence and mortality rates were recorded in 5-year intervals. The 5-year absolute risk based on PRS was estimated using an iterative method detailed by Mavaddat et al. The 5-year absolute risk predicted by the Gail model was estimated using the method in the BCRA package in R. Details on the calculation of 5-year absolute risks are available in Additional file 1.

### Artificial intelligence and early detection of pancreatic cancer: 2020 summative review [^113Gpakz]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

AI and Risk Assessment

The goal of cancer screening programs – is to enable earlier cancer diagnosis while minimizing screening harms. To achieve this goal, all screening programs rely on cancer risk models, which predict who is likely to develop cancer at a future point in time. Some screening programs, such as lung cancerand breast cancer screening, use risk factors as simple as age and smoking history, whereas others, such as guidelines for screening breast MRI, use more sophisticated statistical risk models, that combine age, family history, and other clinical factors. For pancreatic cancer, sufficient risk models are still needed to enable effective screening programs. The key to developing more effective screening guidelines, which enable both earlier detection and less overtreatment, is to develop more accurate risk models.

Deep learning applied to medical imaging has the potential to transform risk modeling and screening guidelines. The use of imaging to inform cancer risk has long been explored in the context of breast cancer. As early as 1976, mammographic breast density, which measures the amount of fibroglandular tissue in the breast, has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Breast density is widely adopted; for instance, it is a part of US federal reporting requirements with screening mammographyand a component of major risk models. Despite its widespread adoption, the benefit of using mammographic breast density in risk models is relatively small. For instance, Brentnall et alincorporated mammographic breast density into the Gail risk model and Tyrer-Cuzick model and found that their areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) improved from 0.55 and 0.57 to 0.59 and 0.61, respectively. We note that AUCs are a commonly used accuracy metric in risk modeling, where a score of 0.50 corresponds to random chance and 1.0 corresponds to perfect prediction. The central limitation of breast density is that it is a poor proxy of the rich information contained within a mammogram; breast density summarizes the millions of pixels captured in digital mammography into a coarse human-designed biomarker. Deep learning image–based models for breast cancer risk, offer a promising alternative paradigm. Instead of manually selecting which mammography patterns may be informative for breast cancer risk, these models instead rely directly on the data to deduce these patterns. By training these models to directly predict future cancer risk from a mammography, these models learn to identify which mammographic cues are most predictive of future cancer. In recent work, Yala et alshowed that their breast cancer risk model could obtain an AUC of 0.78 compared with an AUC of 0.62 by the Tyrer-Cuzick model, the current clinical standard. In practical terms, the authors showed their risk model identified 42% of patients with future cancer as high risk, compared with 23% by the Tyrer-Cuzick model. Although the current performance of these models is promising, we note that can still be improved through better algorithm design and by leveraging richer sources of information, such as tomosynthesis or sequences of mammograms. In other words, we are still only scratching the surface of what is possible in image-based risk modeling both in breast cancer and in other cancers.

### Breast cancer risk feedback to women in the UK NHS breast screening population [^116qZLoe]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

UK deaths from breast cancer have declined by 40% in women < 70 years. Some of this fall is attributed to mammographic screening, but widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapies and general improvements in care have also contributed. Unlike many national breast screening programmes, which typically use one or two yearly intervals, the interval between mammograms in the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) is 3 years. There is evidence that women at high risk of breast cancer (30%+ lifetime risk or 8% 10-year risk – NICE guidelines;) are more likely to develop interval cancers and reducing the screening interval in this poor prognosis group may be indicated. The Swedish two-county study showed women with a positive family history of breast cancer were more likely to develop breast cancer between their two-yearly screens than women with negative family histories. High mammographic density also increases the chances of developing breast cancers as well as interval cancers due possibly to masking effects, suggesting density should be incorporated into risk models. Stratification of screening frequency by risk is likely to be cost effective.

Breast cancer risk is generally assessed using models that include breast cancer family history, reproductive and hormonal history (age at first pregnancy, menarche, menopause, HRT use), height and weight. Models generally perform well for predicting risk in a population (e.g. 1 in 3 lifetime risk) but not for precise individual risk.

In the United States, the Gail model is widely used. It is based on age, first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of surgical breast biopsies and reproductive factors as above. In a comparison of models using UK data, we demonstrated that for women with a family history of breast cancer the Tyrer-Cuzick model performed better than the Gail model; similar results were reported with US data. The Tyrer-Cuzick model has a more extensive familial component and includes HRT, height and weight. Nevertheless, many breast cancers arise in women with no commonly assessed risk factors.

### Development of malignancy-risk gene signature assay for predicting breast cancer risk [^1168GoF8]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer (BC) risk assessment models are statistical estimates based on patient characteristics. We developed a gene expression assay to assess BC risk using benign breast biopsy tissue.

Methods

A NanoString-based malignancy risk (MR) gene signature was validated for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. It was applied to FFPE benign and BC specimens obtained from women who underwent breast biopsy, some of whom developed BC during follow-up to evaluate diagnostic capability of the MR signature. BC risk was calculated with MR score, Gail risk score, and both tests combined. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate these 3 models.

Results

NanoString MR demonstrated concordance between fresh frozen and FFPE malignant samples (r = 0.99). Within the validation set, 563 women with benign breast biopsies from 2007 to 2011 were identified and followed for at least 5 y; 50 women developed BC (affected) within 5 y from biopsy. Three groups were compared: benign tissue from unaffected and affected patients and malignant tissue from affected patients. Kruskal-Wallis test suggested difference between the groups (P = 0.09) with trend in higher predicted MR score for benign tissue from affected patients before development of BC. Neither the MR signature nor Gail risk score were statistically different between affected and unaffected patients; combining both tests demonstrated best predictive value (AUC = 0.71).

Conclusions

FFPE gene expression assays can be used to develop a predictive test for BC. Further investigation of the combined MR signature and Gail Model is required. Our assay was limited by scant cellularity of archived breast tissue.

### Overlap of high-risk individuals predicted by family history, and genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk prediction models: implications for risk stratification [^112oHBfa]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Family history and genetic risk stratification models identified much younger breast cancer patients at high risk

For women below standard mammography screening entry age of 50 years (age 30 to 50 years; n = 3227), the breast cancer risk stratification tools studied identified 40% (n = 1276) of the breast cancer patients to be high risk. Risk stratification by positive family history, PTV carriership, and 5-year absolute risk ≥ 1.3% by PRS or the Gail model identified 470 (15%), 213 (7%), 769 (24%), and 325 (10%) unique breast cancer patients who were considered at high risk of breast cancer, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The genetic risk stratification models, PTV carriership and PRS, identified 114 and 610 additional high-risk individuals that were not identified by family history and the Gail model. Thirty-seven individuals were considered high risk based on both PTV carriership and PRS. Slight concordance was observed between the criteria based on the 5-year absolute risks by PRS and the Gail model in classifying young patients as high risk (Cohen's kappa: 0.052, p < 0.001, Additional file 2 – Table S6). Additional file 2 – Fig. S2 presents the classification of high-risk patients by study.

### Gail model improves the diagnostic performance of the fifth edition of ultrasound BI-RADS for predicting breast cancer: a multicenter prospective study [^1131F4Us]. Academic Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The sonographic appearance of benign and malignant breast nodules overlaps to some extent, and we aimed to assess the performance of the Gail model as an adjunctive tool to ultrasound (US) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for predicting the malignancy of nodules.

Materials and Methods

From 2018 to 2019, 2607 patients were prospectively enrolled by 35 health care facilities. An individual breast cancer risk was assessed by the Gail model. Based on B-mode US, color Doppler, and elastography, all nodules were evaluated according to the fifth edition of BI-RADS, and these nodules were all confirmed later by pathology.

Results

We demonstrated that the Gail model, age, tumor size, tumor shape, growth orientation, margin, contour, acoustic shadowing, microcalcification, presence of duct ectasia, presence of architectural distortion, color Doppler flow, BI-RADS, and elastography score were significantly related to breast cancer (all p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) for combining the Gail model with the BI-RADS category were 95.6%, 91.3%, 85.0%, 97.6%, 92.8%, and 0.98, respectively. Combining the Gail model with the BI-RADS showed better diagnostic efficiency than the BI-RADS and Gail model alone (AUC 0.98 vs 0.80, p < 0.001; AUC 0.98 vs 0.55, p < 0.001) and demonstrated a higher specificity than the BI-RADS (91.3% vs 59.4%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The Gail model could be used to differentiate malignant and benign breast lesions. Combined with the BI-RADS category, the Gail model was adjunctive to US for predicting breast lesions for malignancy. For the diagnosis of malignancy, more attention should be paid to high-risk patients with breast lesions.

### Validation of the mirai model for predicting breast cancer risk in Mexican women [^1143zpLz]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk prediction using the Mirai model

The Mirai model has been made freely available as an open-source tool for research purposes. We applied the model to mammographic examinations of the patients in our study to predict each patient's risk of developing cancer within the follow-up period following their mammographic examination. No image processing was performed. Only image anonymization was carried out by removing patient names while preserving essential information of the image (size, resolution, view, and laterality).

The Mirai model, akin to the Tyrer–Cuzick or Gail model, provides a continuous risk index designed to predict risk rather than diagnostic outcomes. Unlike clinic-based diagnostic tools, Mirai lacks a predefined cutoff value and relies on recommended guidelines for application. A crucial aspect is assessing Mirai's correlation with true and censored events, often quantified using the concordance index (C-index), a key metric for evaluating predictive accuracy.

### The landmark series-addressing disparities in breast cancer screening: new recommendations for black women [^112jVvPC]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomized, clinical trials have established the efficacy of screening mammography in improving survival from breast cancer for women through detection of early, asymptomatic disease. However, disparities in survival rates between black women and women from other racial and ethnic groups following breast cancer diagnosis persist. Various professional groups have different, somewhat conflicting, guidelines with regards to recommended age for commencing screening as well as recommended frequency of screening exams, but the trials upon which these recommendations are based were not specifically designed to examine benefit among black women. Furthermore, these recommendations do not appear to incorporate the unique epidemiological circumstances of breast cancer among black women, including higher rates of diagnosis before age 40 years and greater likelihood of advanced stage at diagnosis, into their formulation. In this review, we examined the epidemiologic and socioeconomic factors that are associated with breast cancer among black women and assess the implications of these factors for screening in this population. Specifically, we recommend that by no later than age 25 years, all black women should undergo baseline assessment for future risk of breast cancer utilizing a model that incorporates race (e.g. Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool [BCRAT], formerly the Gail model) and that this assessment should be conducted by a breast specialist or a healthcare provider (e.g., primary care physician or gynecologist) who is trained to assess breast cancer risk and is aware of the increased risks of early (i.e., premenopausal) and biologically aggressive (e.g., late-stage, triple-negative) breast cancer among black women.

### Evaluating the performance of the breast and ovarian analysis of disease incidence algorithm model in predicting 10-year breast cancer risks in UK biobank [^1127H2ju]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

The Gail and the Tyrer–Cuzick models have previously been validated in postmenopausal women of White British ancestry from the UK Biobank. These models also showed improved performance with the inclusion of a breast cancer polygenic risk score: Tyrer–Cuzick C index of 0.57 (95% CI = 0.55 to 0.58), increasing to 0.67 (95% CI = 0.66 to 0.69) with polygenic risk score; Gail C index of 0.54 (95% CI = 0.52 to 0.56), increasing to 0.67 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.68) with polygenic risk score. These findings are consistent with the present study. However, the reported AUCs may have been overestimated because the models including the polygenic risk score were developed using a cross-validation approach within the UK Biobank datasets. Therefore, the reported AUC values do not necessarily represent an independent validation. Despite model recalibration, within UK Biobank, the models also showed overall miscalibration with calibration slopes 1.10 to 1.11 for the Tyrer–Cuzick and Gail models, respectively. These compare with an estimated calibration slope of 0.99 in the present study. BOADICEA considers a more comprehensive set of risk factors, including pathogenic genetic variants in all established breast cancer susceptibility genes, and unlike the published validation, which focused solely on postmenopausal women, the present analysis provides evidence that that BOADICEA performs well in predicting risks for women across the age range of 40–69 years.

### Projecting absolute invasive breast cancer risk in white women with a model that includes mammographic density [^112pwGHr]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To improve the discriminatory power of the Gail model for predicting absolute risk of invasive breast cancer, we previously developed a relative risk model that incorporated mammographic density (DENSITY) from data on white women in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP). That model also included the variables age at birth of first live child (AGEFLB), number of affected mother or sisters (NUMREL), number of previous benign breast biopsy examinations (NBIOPS), and weight (WEIGHT). In this study, we developed the corresponding model for absolute risk.

Methods

We combined the relative risk model with data on the distribution of the variables AGEFLB, NUMREL, NBIOPS, and WEIGHT from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, with data on the conditional distribution of DENSITY given other risk factors in BCDDP, with breast cancer incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute, and with national mortality rates. Confidence intervals (CIs) accounted for variability of estimates of relative risks and of risk factor distributions. We compared the absolute 5-year risk projections from the new model with those from the Gail model on 1744 white women.

Results

Attributable risks of breast cancer associated with DENSITY, AGEFLB, NUMREL, NBIOPS, and WEIGHT were 0.779 (95% CI = 0.733 to 0.819) and 0.747 (95% CI = 0.702 to 0.788) for women younger than 50 years and 50 years or older, respectively. The model predicted higher risks than the Gail model for women with a high percentage of dense breast area. However, the average risk projections from the new model in various age groups were similar to those from the Gail model, suggesting that the new model is well calibrated.

Conclusions

This new model for absolute invasive breast cancer risk in white women promises modest improvements in discriminatory power compared with the Gail model but needs to be validated with independent data.

### Raloxifene (raloxifene hydrochloride) [^1118gKcF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.3 Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer

Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk of invasive breast cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

The effect in the reduction in the incidence of breast cancer was shown in a study of postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer with a 5-year planned duration with a median follow-up of 4.3 years [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Twenty-seven percent of the participants received drug for 5 years. The long-term effects and the recommended length of treatment are not known.

High risk of breast cancer is defined as at least one breast biopsy showing lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia, one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, or a 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer ≥ 1.66% (based on the modified Gail model). Among the factors included in the modified Gail model are the following: current age, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, age at menarche, nulliparity or age of first live birth. Healthcare professionals can obtain a Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool by dialing 1–800–545–5979. Currently, no single clinical finding or test result can quantify risk of breast cancer with certainty.

After an assessment of the risk of developing breast cancer, the decision regarding therapy with raloxifene hydrochloride tablets should be based upon an individual assessment of the benefits and risks.

Raloxifene hydrochloride does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer. Patients should have breast exams and mammograms before starting raloxifene hydrochloride tablets and should continue regular breast exams and mammograms in keeping with good medical practice after beginning treatment with raloxifene hydrochloride.

Important Limitations of Use for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction

There are no data available regarding the effect of raloxifene hydrochloride on invasive breast cancer incidence in women with inherited mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2) to be able to make specific recommendations on the effectiveness of raloxifene hydrochloride.
Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets are not indicated for the treatment of invasive breast cancer or reduction of the risk of recurrence.
Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets are not indicated for the reduction in the risk of noninvasive breast cancer.

### A case-control study to add volumetric or clinical mammographic density into the tyrer-cuzick breast cancer risk model [^114LcT5n]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer mortality rates in the United States have fallen substantially since 1990 because of early detection of the disease and better treatment. However, breast cancer remains a public health challenge: it is the most common cancer among women in the United States and worldwide, and generational changes in hormonal and reproductive breast cancer risk factor prevalence indicate that incidence will continue to rise. Further improvements in breast cancer screening and prevention are needed.

There is increasing interest in tailoring breast cancer screening and prevention strategies based on individual risk estimation. A variety of risk models has been developed to guide this process, and some are already recommended to determine eligibility for additional screening by magnetic resonance imaging. A clinical issue arising is that different models may provide different risk evaluations for the same woman, partly because they do not all incorporate the same comprehensive set of established risk factors, including breast density.

A comprehensive breast cancer risk model is desirable. A large body of evidence supports the role of breast density as a risk factor, but relatively few studies have empirically assessed breast density combined with a comprehensive set of other risk factors. The Gail model has been updated to include breast density, but the measure used has not been applied in clinical practice; the same limitation is noted for an updated Tyrer-Cuzick model. A model developed within the breast cancer surveillance consortium includes clinical mammographic density (BI-RADS density), but not a comprehensive set of risk factors (including age of affected relative, second-degree relatives, and weight).

The case-control study discussed in this article was designed specifically to improve risk assessment for breast cancer. The analysis reported here aimed to extend the Tyrer-Cuzick model by determining the risk associated with 2 measures of mammographic density after adjustment for the other factors in the model. Both of the mammographic density methods considered are feasible for clinical practice (BI-RADS and fully automated volumetric density). The prespecified hypothesis was that both measures of breast density would add information for breast cancer risk assessment to classical risk factors.

### Assessing risk of breast cancer: a review of risk prediction models [^11641vCA]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Accurate and individualized breast cancer risk assessment can be used to guide personalized screening and prevention recommendations. Existing risk prediction models use genetic and nongenetic risk factors to provide an estimate of a woman's breast cancer risk and/or the likelihood that she has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Each model is best suited for specific clinical scenarios and may have limited applicability in certain types of patients. For example, the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which identifies women who would benefit from chemoprevention, is readily accessible and user-friendly but cannot be used in women under 35 years of age or those with prior breast cancer or lobular carcinoma in situ. Emerging research on deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) models suggests that mammographic images contain risk indicators that could be used to strengthen existing risk prediction models. This article reviews breast cancer risk factors, describes the appropriate use, strengths, and limitations of each risk prediction model, and discusses the emerging role of AI for risk assessment.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115cmvf6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer risk thresholds and counseling algorithm — There are no established clear criteria for recommending (or avoiding) MHT based on a woman's risk of breast cancer. Nonsignificant trends from the WHI suggest that the relative risk of breast cancer in association with MHT remains stable or increases in the 5-year Gail model breast risk categories of < 1.25 vs ≥ 1.75. The U.S. Preventive Services 2013 Task Force recommends that women with a 5-year risk of ≥ 3% should be considered for preventive therapy with tamoxifen or raloxifene, whereas the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines suggest discussing such therapy in women with a risk of ≥ 1.67%. We suggest one potential algorithm for MHT counseling, extrapolated from breast cancer prevention trial enrollment criteria, that is not validated in clinical trials; Table 7 proposes 5-y NCI or IBIS risk cutoffs and suggested approaches: low < 1.67 'MHT ok', intermediate 1.67–5 'Caution', and high > 5 'Avoid'. Footnote b specifies that 'Caution' indicates detailed counseling with strong consideration of nonhormonal therapies and possible consideration of chemopreventive strategies; another consideration is that breast cancer risk is associated with combined estrogen/progestogen use, but less so, if at all, with CEE alone.

### Novel breast tissue feature strongly associated with risk of breast cancer [^11579YTH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Accurate, individualized risk prediction for breast cancer is lacking. Tissue-based features may help to stratify women into different risk levels. Breast lobules are the anatomic sites of origin of breast cancer. As women age, these lobular structures should regress, which results in reduced breast cancer risk. However, this does not occur in all women.

Methods

We have quantified the extent of lobule regression on a benign breast biopsy in 85 patients who developed breast cancer and 142 age-matched controls from the Mayo Benign Breast Disease Cohort, by determining number of acini per lobule and lobular area. We also calculated Gail model 5-year predicted risks for these women.

Results

There is a step-wise increase in breast cancer risk with increasing numbers of acini per lobule (P = 0.0004). Adjusting for Gail model score, parity, histology, and family history did not attenuate this association. Lobular area was similarly associated with risk. The Gail model estimates were associated with risk of breast cancer (P = 0.03). We examined the individual accuracy of these measures using the concordance (c) statistic. The Gail model c statistic was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.70); the acinar count c statistic was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.75). Combining acinar count and lobular area, the c statistic was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.78). Adding the Gail model to these measures did not improve the c statistic.

Conclusion

Novel, tissue-based features that reflect the status of a woman's normal breast lobules are associated with breast cancer risk. These features may offer a novel strategy for risk prediction.

### Chemoprevention for breast cancer [^113HXmaT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

In general, women with a history of AH, or women under the age of 50 years, are more likely to benefit from preventive therapy. This is based on the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) data subgroup analysis that demonstrated a significant 86% risk reduction for women with AH. Furthermore, the evidence supports that women under the age of 50 years are far less likely to incur the harms of therapy seen in women 50 years of age or older. Conversely, in many older women the harms of preventive therapy far outweigh the benefits as their risk of adverse effects is greater.

The NCCN Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Panel has adopted the 1.7% or greater 5-year actuarial breast cancer risk defined by the modified Gail model as the risk threshold for discussion of chemoprevention. This is consistent with eligibility criteria utilized in the NSABP BCPT and the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR).–Another risk calculation model commonly used is the IBIS or Tyrer–Cuzick model. It includes BRCA status, height, weight, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, age at first live birth, age of onset of cancers in relatives, the presence of ovarian cancer, and second- and third-generation family history on the maternal and paternal side. It is more complex, less accessible to primary care providers, and currently utilized mainly to determine eligibility for enhanced screening with MRI, in addition to mammography, in women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer ≥ 20%.

The recently updated American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on the use of pharmacological interventions for breast cancer risk reduction states that the risk for breast cancer may be determined by the aforementioned BCRAT tool "or other validated models including Tyrer–Cuzick".

In a head-to-head comparison of the BCRAT and the IBIS model looking at the absolute 10-year risk of breast cancer, the IBIS model showed better discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] for IBIS 69.5%, 95% CI 63.8–75.2 versus AUC for BRCAT 63.2%, 95% CI 57.6–68.9).

There is no validated model that accounts for breast density, yet it is hoped that one might be developed in the future that will include breast density and be capable of effectively identifying women suitable for both enhanced screening and chemoprevention.

### Tamoxifen citrate (Soltamox) [^1145YHmh]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (NSABP P-1)

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (NSABP P-1) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a primary objective to determine whether 5 years of another formulation of tamoxifen therapy (20 mg per day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease. Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the incidence of ischemic heart disease; the effects on the incidence of bone fractures; and other events associated with the use of tamoxifen, including endometrial cancer, pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and cataract formation and surgery.

The Breast Cancer Assessment Tool1(the Gail Model) was used to calculate predicted breast cancer risk for women who were less than 60 years of age and did not have lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). The following risk factors were used: age; number of first-degree female relatives with breast cancer; previous breast biopsies; presence or absence of atypical hyperplasia; nulliparity; age at first live birth; and age at menarche. A 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer of ≥ 1.67% was required for entry into the trial.

In this trial, 13,388 women of at least 35 years of age were randomized to receive either tamoxifen or placebo for five years. The median duration of treatment was 3.5 years. Follow-up data were available for 13,114 women. Twenty-seven percent of women randomized to placebo (1,782) and 24% of women randomized to tamoxifen (1,596) completed 5 years of therapy.

### Breast cancer risk assessment in indigent women at a public hospital [^112DoURJ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to estimate the 5-year breast cancer risk in indigent women presenting to the gynecology clinic at a public hospital and to determine whether routine use of the computerized Gail model for screening in this population identifies individuals at increased risk.

Methods

A prospective study was performed over 1-year period (7/99–7/00) of women presenting to the gynecology and gynecologic oncology clinics at a public hospital. All women ages 35–60 years with no personal history of breast cancer were offered testing utilizing the computerized Gail model provided by the National Cancer Institute. Age, race, age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, and number of breast biopsies diagnosed as atypical hyperplasia were documented. A calculated 5-year risk ≥ 1.67% was considered high-risk.

Results

In all, 319 women enrolled, 121 (38%) with a history of gynecologic cancer and 198 (62%) without. The mean age was 46.9 years (range 35–60), and 28 (8.8%) patients had at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer. Ethnicity included 206 (65%) African American, 52 (16%) Caucasian, 45 (14%) Hispanic, and 16 (5%) oriental. Eight (2.5%) women had a 5-year risk ≥ 1.67%. The mean 5-year risk for all patients was 0.68% (0.55% for African American versus 0.90% for Caucasian/other, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Estimating 5-year breast cancer risk using the Gail model in indigent women may identify individuals at increased risk. Compared to other patients, African American women appeared to have a lower estimated 5-year risk according to the currently available model. The routine utilization of the Gail model deserves further investigation in the indigent minority population.

### Evaluating mammographic density's contribution to improve a breast cancer risk model with questionnaire-based and polygenic factors [^116Wj1sw]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast density has been incorporated into established risk models like the Gail model, the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) model, the Tyrer-Cuzick (IBIS) model, Rosner-Colditz model and the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) –. The BCSC, Tyrer-Cuzick and BOADICEA models also incorporate density into their clinical risk calculator tools –. A robust evaluation of the added value of mammographic breast density to a model with comprehensive information on questionnaire-based risk factors and the most recent polygenic risk scores are needed to determine its effectiveness in improving risk stratification of models.

In our current work, we validate the fully integrated model with questionnaire-based risk factors, the 313-SNP PRS and density for calibration and discrimination in three prospective cohorts of European-ancestry women (two from the US and one from Sweden), totaling 1468 cases and 19,104 controls. Our risk projection and reclassification calculations in the populations of European-ancestry women aged 50–70 years from the US and Sweden show the improvements in risk stratification attainable by incorporating density to the current literature-based model with questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^1165eHC3]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Risk reduction — eligibility thresholds and options: Endocrine therapy should be offered for risk reduction to women with atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, or lobular carcinoma in situ and to those with a 5-year risk ≥ 3% using the Gail model or with a 10-year risk ≥ 5% using Tyrer-Cuzick; endocrine therapy reduces the risk of developing estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer by 50% or more in these groups, with options including tamoxifen (the only option for premenopausal women), raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole.

### Distribution of estimated lifetime breast cancer risk among women undergoing screening mammography [^115kAgQW]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Supplemental screening breast MRI is recommended for women with an estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer of greater than 20–25%. The performance of risk prediction models varies for each individual and across groups of women. The present study investigates the concordance of three breast cancer risk prediction models among women presenting for screening mammography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. In this prospective study, we calculated the estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer using the modified Gail, Tyrer-Cuzick version 7, and BRCAPRO models for each woman who presented for screening mammography. Per American Cancer Society guidelines, for each woman the risk was categorized as less than 20% or 20% or greater as well as less than 25% or 25% or greater with use of each model. Venn diagrams were constructed to evaluate concordance across models. The McNemar test was used to test differences in risk group allocations between models, with p ≤ .05 considered to denote statistical significance. RESULTS. Of 3503 screening mammography patients who underwent risk stratification, 3219 (91.9%) were eligible for risk estimation using all three models. Using at least one model, 440 (13.7%) women had a lifetime risk of 20% or greater, including 390 women (12.1%) according to the Tyrer-Cuzick version 7 model, 18 (0.6%) according to the BRCAPRO model, and 141 (4.4%) according to the modified Gail model. Six women (0.2%) had a risk of 20% or greater according to all three models. Women were significantly more likely to be classified as having a high lifetime breast cancer risk by the Tyrer-Cuzick version 7 model compared with the modified Gail model, with thresholds of 20% or greater (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.7–8.7) or 25% or greater (odds ratio, 7.4; 95% CI, 4.7–11.9) used for both models. CONCLUSION. To identify women with a high lifetime breast cancer risk, practices should use estimates of lifetime breast cancer risk derived from multiple risk prediction models.

### Breast-tissue sampling for risk assessment and prevention [^1114fQYy]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Breast tissue and duct fluid provide a rich source of biomarkers to both aid in the assessment of short-term risk of developing breast cancer and predict and assess responses to prevention interventions. There are three methods currently being utilized to sample breast tissue in asymptomatic women for risk assessment: nipple-aspirate fluid (NAF), random periareolar fine-needle aspiration (RPFNA) and ductal lavage. Prospective single-institution trials have shown that the presence of atypical cells in NAF fluid or RPFNA specimens is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Furthermore, RPFNA-detected atypia has been observed to further stratify risk based on the commonly used Gail risk-assessment model. A prospective trial evaluating risk prediction on the basis of atypical cells in ductal-lavage fluid is ongoing. The ability of other established non-genetic biomarkers (mammographic breast density; serum levels of bioavailable estradiol, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor-1 and its insulin like growth factor binding protein-3) to stratify risk based on the Gail model is as yet incompletely defined. Modulation of breast intra-epithelial neoplasia (i.e. hyperplasia with or without atypia) with or without associated breast-tissue molecular markers, such as proliferation, is currently being used to evaluate response in Phase II chemoprevention trials. RPFNA has been the method most frequently used for Phase II studies of 6–12 months duration. However, ductal lavage, RPFNA and random and directed core needle biopsies are all being utilized in ongoing multi-institutional Phase II studies. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are reviewed.

### Breast cancer risk assessment tool: online calculator-NCI… [^1164EhcV]. bcrisktool.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, also known as The Gail Model, allows health professionals to estimate a woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer over the next five years and up to age 90. The tool uses a woman's personal medical and reproductive history and the history of breast cancer among her first-degree relatives to estimate absolute breast cancer risk-her chance or probability of developing invasive breast cancer in a defined age interval. This calculator takes about five minutes to complete. About the Calculator The tool has been validated for White women, Black/African American women, Hispanic women, and for Asian and Pacific Islander women in the United States. The tool may underestimate risk in Black women with previous biopsies and Hispanic women born outside the United States.

Because data on American Indian/Alaska Native women are limited, their risk estimates are partly based on data for White women and may be inaccurate. Further studies are needed to refine and validate these models. Calculator Limitations This tool cannot accurately estimate breast cancer risk for:

- Women carrying a breast-cancer-producing mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2
- Women with a previous history of invasive or in situ breast cancer
- Women in certain other subgroups Although a woman's risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely which woman will develop breast cancer. In fact, some women who do not develop breast cancer have higher risk estimates than some women who do develop breast cancer.

### About the calculator… [^111SQuJT]. bcrisktool.cancer.gov (2017). Low credibility.

About the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Calculator ON THIS PAGE The Gail Model The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model known as the Gail Model, named after Dr. Mitchell Gail, Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics The tool uses a woman's own personal information to estimate risk of developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time, including:

- Age
- Age at the start of menstruation
- Age at first live birth of a child
- Number of first-degree relative with breast cancer
- Number of previous breast biopsies
- Presence of atypical hyperplasia in a biopsy.

Data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, a joint NCI and American Cancer Society breast cancer screening study that involved 280, 000 White women aged 35 to 74 years, and from the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, were used in developing the model. Testing the Model The Gail Model has been tested in large populations of White women and has been shown to provide accurate estimates of breast cancer risk. The model was tested for Asian and Pacific Islander women, Black/African American, and Hispanic women using data from the Women's Health Initiative. It performed well but may underestimate risk in Black/African American women with previous biopsies and Hispanic women born outside the United States. The model needs further validation for Hispanic women and other subgroups. Researchers are conducting additional studies to gather more data to test and improve the model.
