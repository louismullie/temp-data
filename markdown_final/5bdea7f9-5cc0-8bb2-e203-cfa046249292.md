## Question

13 yr old with scoliosis what are the presentation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the presentation of scoliosis in a 13-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and definition of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in this age group. Then, I should verify the typical clinical signs on examination, including asymmetry and trunk rotation. Next, I will consider symptomatology, especially pain and when it becomes concerning. After that, I need to check red flags that suggest non-idiopathic etiologies. Finally, I will integrate how curve magnitude and growth potential modify presentation and urgency, and close with practical clinical implications for evaluation and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definition. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is defined by a lateral spinal curvature of at least 10 degrees (Cobb angle) in children aged 10 to 18 years, with no identifiable congenital, neuromuscular, or other secondary cause, and it affects roughly 1% to 3% of adolescents, with a female predominance for progression risk, which is highly relevant at age 13 [^16c12b98] [^a98ba34e] [^026e175d].

> Wait, let me verify the typical physical findings on examination. The most common presentation is a visibly asymmetric trunk with shoulder or scapular asymmetry, unequal waist triangles, and a rib hump or lumbar prominence on forward bend testing, reflecting vertebral rotation and coronal plane deformity; these asymmetries are often first noticed by families or during school screening, and the Adams forward bend test with scoliometer helps quantify trunk rotation and guide imaging decisions [^16c12b98] [^63c29d30] [^2b191644].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms. I initially thought most 13-year-olds with AIS are asymptomatic, but I should double-check pain prevalence. While AIS is often painless, back pain is not rare at presentation; one large prospective study found back pain in up to 23% at presentation, and other cohorts show period prevalence of thoracic or low back pain ranging from about 6% to 29% depending on the window, with higher odds of pain when curves exceed 40 degrees or when biopsychosocial factors like poor sleep or depression are present, so I need to ask about pain, sleep, and mood carefully [^8451922a] [^82174f10].

> I need to ensure I screen for red flags that suggest non-idiopathic scoliosis. Severe pain, neurologic deficits, atypical curve patterns such as a left thoracic curve, hyperkyphosis, rapid progression, or systemic symptoms should prompt evaluation for underlying etiologies like syringomyelia, Chiari malformation, spinal cord tumor, or neuromuscular disease; case series and reports highlight that hyperkyphosis, left thoracic curves, or rapidly progressive deformities can herald neural axis abnormalities, and a 13-year-old with scoliosis plus neurologic signs warrants MRI rather than routine AIS care [^284ba62f] [^77b40db0] [^0bbd5c0f].

> Let me consider how curve magnitude and growth potential shape presentation and urgency. Small curves, often 10–20 degrees, are frequently subtle and stable, whereas curves approaching 25–30 degrees are more noticeable and carry higher progression risk during growth spurts; curves beyond 40–50 degrees are more likely to cause cosmetic distress, mechanical pain, and, in rare severe cases, respiratory symptoms, and progression risk is tightly linked to skeletal immaturity and the magnitude of the initial curve, which is why Risser sign and menarche status matter at 13 years old [^16c12b98] [^3b9c6c35] [^6bc8f9e6].

> But wait, what if the "presentation" is not just the physical exam and symptoms, but also the psychosocial context. Adolescents may report body image concerns, clothing fit issues, or avoidance of activities like swimming; these psychosocial impacts are real and can be as clinically salient as pain or asymmetry, so I should ask explicitly about self-image, social participation, and activity limitations during the visit [^16c12b98] [^63c29d30].

> Next, I should review the practical clinical implications for a 13-year-old presenting with suspected scoliosis. Confirm with a standing PA (or AP) full-spine radiograph to measure Cobb angle, assess skeletal maturity with Risser and Tanner staging, and use scoliometer thresholds around 5–7 degrees to decide on imaging; if red flags are present, add MRI to evaluate the neural axis, and if the curve is mild and the child is near maturity, observation with periodic clinical and radiographic follow-up is appropriate, whereas progressive or larger curves may require bracing or surgical discussion depending on magnitude and growth potential [^9ec09264] [^2b191644] [^0bbd5c0f] [^5e81012e].

> In summary, I should confirm that the typical 13-year-old with AIS presents with trunk asymmetry and rotational prominence on forward bend, often with minimal or no pain, but I must remain alert to pain, neurologic signs, atypical curves, or rapid progression that could signal non-idiopathic disease; curve magnitude and skeletal maturity at this age critically determine the likelihood of progression and the urgency of intervention, so careful clinical and radiographic assessment is essential to align counseling and management with the child's risk profile [^16c12b98] [^a98ba34e] [^3b9c6c35].

In a 13-year-old with scoliosis, the most common presentation is **asymmetric shoulders or waist** and a **rib hump** on forward bend, often detected incidentally or during screening [^16c12b98] [^63c29d30]. Most adolescents are **asymptomatic**, but some report mild back pain or stiffness, especially with larger curves or rapid progression [^82174f10] [^8451922a]. Severe curves (> 60°) may cause visible deformity, reduced pulmonary function, or psychosocial distress [^16c12b98] [^c0b9a53c]. Red flags such as severe pain, neurologic deficits, or atypical curves warrant MRI to exclude underlying pathology [^0bbd5c0f] [^284ba62f]. Early detection and monitoring are key, as progression risk is highest during the adolescent growth spurt [^3b9c6c35] [^6bc8f9e6].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

### Visible deformity

- **Asymmetric shoulders**: One shoulder appears higher than the other [^691db354].
- **Asymmetric waist or hips**: Uneven waistline or hip prominence [^691db354].
- **Rib prominence**: Visible rib hump or prominence on forward bend (Adam's test) [^16c12b98].
- **Trunk shift**: Lateral shift of the trunk or torso [^691db354].

---

### Pain

Pain is **usually mild or absent**; back pain occurs in about 23% at presentation, more often with larger curves or rapid progression [^8451922a] [^82174f10]. Pain is typically mechanical and activity-related; severe or persistent pain warrants further evaluation [^notfound].

---

### Functional limitations

Functional limitations are **generally minimal**; mild stiffness or reduced flexibility may occur, and severe curves (> 60°) can impair pulmonary function, causing dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance [^c0b9a53c].

---

### Psychosocial impact

Psychosocial impact may include **body image concerns**, self-consciousness, and emotional distress, particularly with visible deformity or brace wear [^16c12b98] [^1c0a8974].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical examination

- **Adam's forward bend test**: Screens for trunk rotation and rib prominence [^16c12b98].
- **Scoliometer**: Quantifies trunk rotation; ≥ 5° suggests scoliosis [^2b191644].
- **Neurologic exam**: Assesses for deficits suggesting non-idiopathic etiology [^e279b87f].

---

### Imaging

Imaging includes **standing PA radiographs** to confirm diagnosis, measure Cobb angle, and assess skeletal maturity (Risser sign) [^9ec09264] [^e22d00e4]. MRI is indicated for atypical curves, neurologic deficits, or suspected underlying pathology [^0bbd5c0f] [^284ba62f].

---

## Factors influencing presentation

- **Curve magnitude**: Larger curves cause more visible deformity and symptoms [^16c12b98].
- **Curve pattern**: Thoracic curves are more visible than lumbar curves [^notfound].
- **Growth potential**: Rapid growth increases progression risk and symptom severity [^3b9c6c35].
- **Gender**: Females have higher progression risk and may have more pronounced deformity [^3b9c6c35] [^026e175d].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek medical attention for **visible spinal asymmetry** or a rib hump, back pain persisting beyond two weeks, or neurologic symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or gait changes. Also seek care for rapid progression of deformity or new respiratory symptoms [^0f651bca].

---

## Conclusion

In a 13-year-old with scoliosis, the typical presentation is **asymmetric shoulders or waist** with a **rib hump** on forward bend, often without pain. Severe curves can cause visible deformity, respiratory symptoms, and psychosocial distress. Early detection and monitoring are essential, especially during the adolescent growth spurt [^3b9c6c35].

### Imaging in scoliosis: what, why and how? [^0700ba25]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Scoliosis may be a spinal manifestation of underlying disease and although most cases of scoliosis are idiopathic, imaging plays a very important role in determining the underlying aetiology and in monitoring the changes of the deformity that take place with growth. As a clinical problem scoliosis may present directly to the radiology department through a primary healthcare referral, or it may be referred from the paediatric, orthopaedic, spinal and neurosurgical hospital services. Growth affects all types of scoliosis irrespective of cause. There are no reliable predetermined algorithmic steps in the management of scoliosis, and treatment decisions require the inclusion of multiple extrinsic (e.g. age, menarche) and intrinsic (curve magnitude, vertebral anomaly) factors. It is important to remember that most of what is known about curve behaviour and its progression applies to idiopathic scoliosis, and it is inappropriate to apply these criteria to the other specific types of scoliosis. It is imperative that radiation techniques are used judiciously to minimize the radiation burden. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has had a significant impact in the understanding of the scoliotic deformity, it is still evolving and it may well eventually play a very important role in uncovering the underlying aetiology of 'idiopathic' scoliosis.

### Determination of normative values for the early onset scoliosis self-reported questionnaire (EOSQ-SELF) [^b6c8b094]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The early-onset scoliosis (EOS) self-questionnaire (EOSQ-SELF) is a recently validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument created to allow patients with EOS to report their perspectives on their own health (Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/BPO/A936). The goal of this study is to establish age-matched normative values for the EOSQ-SELF.

Methods

Patients aged 8 to 18 presenting to an orthopaedic surgery clinic without spinal deformities were enrolled prospectively over 2 years. Those with prior orthopaedic treatment unrelated to scoliosis and patients for second opinion or first consultation regarding scoliosis but with negative scoliosis on imaging were included. Consent was obtained before completing the questionnaire. Participants completed one questionnaire and were grouped by age (8 to 9, 10 to 11, 12 to 13, 14 to 15, and 16 to 18). IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 29, was used for analysis, reporting means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each age group's normative values across all domains.

Results

A total of 119 patients completed the questionnaire. Fifty-six patients (47.1%) were female at birth. The age distribution was 31 (26.1%) in the 8- to 9-year-old group, 21 (17.6%) in the 10- to 11-year-old group, 26 (21.8%) in the 12- to 13-year-old group, 20 (16.8%) in the 14- to 15-year-old group, and 21 (17.6%) in the 16- to 18-year-old group. The 3 most common presentations were: (1) fracture with 48 (40.3%) patients, (2) scoliosis evaluation with unremarkable spinal imaging with 19 (16.0%) patients, and (3) pes planus with 14 (11.8%) patients. When stratified by age group, the total EOSQ-SELF was 79.6 (95% CI: 76.4–82.8) in the 8- to 9-year-old group, 77.7 (95% CI: 73.0–82.4) in the 10- to 11-year-old group, 74.8 (95% CI: 70.1–79.5) in the 12- to 13-year-old group, 78.9 (95% CI: 74.9–82.9) in the 14- to 15-year-old group, 75.0 (95% CI: 70.2–79.9) in the 16- to 18-year-old group.

Conclusion

EOSQ-SELF is still a relatively new PRO instrument, and its utility is still being investigated. Reporting normative values for different age groups is an important step in establishing this utility. This study will help facilitate future studies looking at EOSQ-SELF scores in patients with scoliosis by providing a comparative cohort in patients without scoliosis.

### Evaluation and management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a review [^fa3c065d]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a 3D spinal deformity affecting children between the ages of 11 and 18, without an identifiable etiology. The authors here reviewed the available literature to provide spine surgeons with a summary and update on current management options. Smaller thoracic and thoracolumbar curves can be managed conservatively with observation or bracing, but corrective surgery may be indicated for rapidly growing or larger curves. The authors summarize the atypical features to look for in patients who may warrant further investigation with MRI during diagnosis and review the fundamental principles of the surgical management of AIS. Patients with AIS can be managed very well with a combination of conservative and surgical options. Outcomes for these children are excellent with sustained longer-term results.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a review of aetiological theories of a multifactorial disease [^1cef23ef]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), defined by an age at presentation of 11 to 18 years, has a prevalence of 0.47% and accounts for approximately 90% of all cases of idiopathic scoliosis. Despite decades of research, the exact aetiology of AIS remains unknown. It is becoming evident that it is the result of a complex interplay of genetic, internal, and environmental factors. It has been hypothesized that genetic variants act as the initial trigger that allow epigenetic factors to propagate AIS, which could also explain the wide phenotypic variation in the presentation of the disorder. A better understanding of the underlying aetiological mechanisms could help to establish the diagnosis earlier and allow a more accurate prediction of deformity progression. This, in turn, would prompt imaging and therapeutic intervention at the appropriate time, thereby achieving the best clinical outcome for this group of patients.

### Acute scoliosis in a 3-year-old boy [^cdbf57f5]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The case describes the presentation of a fit and well 3-year-old boy to the emergency department of a district general hospital after he developed an acute scoliosis overnight. There was no history of trauma, his observations were normal and he had non-specific symptoms of lethargy and reduced appetite, but no fevers or respiratory distress. Bloods showed raised inflammatory markers and he was referred to orthopaedics as a septic disc as there was some spinal tenderness. An urgent MRI was considered initially but on further examination there was some reduced air entry on the left lung base which a chest radiograph confirmed as a left-sided pneumonia. A diagnosis of pneumonia and secondary functional scoliosis was made. The child was admitted under paediatrics and made a full recovery on antibiotics. At 8 weeks follow-up there was resolution of scoliosis clinically and radiologically.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^8451922a]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Scoliosis

Idiopathic scoliosis affects 1–3% percent of children and adolescents. On clinical examination, Adams Forward Bend Test will elicit the curve of structural scoliosis and measurement of a Cobb angle of at least 10 degrees on a standing coronal radiograph confirms the diagnosis. Scoliosis is usually painless; however one study reported back pain in up to 23% at presentation. Untreated scoliosis may also cause back pain. Management is determined on an individual patient basis and is dependent on skeletal maturity and degree of the curve. Expectant observation, physiotherapy, orthoses and surgery are potential management strategies.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: diagnosis and management… [^3b9c6c35]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

1–4 Scoliosis is defined as a lateral curve to the spine that is greater than 10 degrees with vertebral rotation. 1–5 It can be classified as congenital, neuromuscular, or idiopathic; approximately 85% of cases are idiopathic. 1–3, 6 Idiopathic scoliosis can be further classified by age of onset: infantile, juvenile, and adolescent. 1–3, 6 Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form. 1–3, 6, 7 Scoliosis usually does not cause problems, but sometimes leads to visible deformity, emotional distress, and respiratory impairment from rib deformity. 1, 3–5, 7–9 Males and females are about equally likely to have minor scoliosis of approximately 10 degrees, but females are five to 10 times more likely to progress to more severe disease, possibly needing treatment.

Risk Factors for Disease Progression Three major factors that determine whether scoliosis will progress are patient sex, magnitude of curve on presentation, and growth potential. 3, 5, 10, 11 One study followed 186 skeletally immature patients with idiopathic scoliosis, diagnosed through school screening, until skeletal maturity. The initial Cobb angle magnitude was the most important predictor of long-term curve progression and behavior past skeletal maturity, whereas initial age, sex, age of menarche, and pubertal status were less important prognostic factors. The authors suggested an initial Cobb angle of 25 degrees as an important threshold magnitude for long-term curve progression.

### Transitional and spectrum-based care for idiopathic scoliosis [^fe26cae1]. Neurosurgical Focus (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study is to discuss the transitional nature of idiopathic scoliosis and the variation in treatment and management across the spectrum of age presentation.

Methods

This is a review article that discusses the evaluation, management, and classification of idiopathic scoliosis. The authors searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane database for articles published up to April 2024. Keywords and MeSH terms relevant to the topic were used, including adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), adult idiopathic scoliosis (AdIS), adult degenerative scoliosis, young adult idiopathic scoliosis, early-onset scoliosis (EOS), classification, management, follow-up, outcomes, natural history, Cobb angle, and transitional care. Reference lists of selected articles were also searched to identify further articles. Inclusion criteria included English language articles that summarized any type of study design, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, case-control/series, or metaanalysis, with study populations ranging from infants to > 50-year-old patients. Inter-reviewer disagreement on inclusion of particular articles was resolved through discussion. Related information was analyzed, and relevant concepts related to the transitional period dilemma have been discussed.

Results

Each idiopathic scoliosis case needs independent assessment with regard to the age, degree of the curve, and patient-specific presentation. An accurate prediction of the curve progression by considering the patient's remaining growth potential is paramount to the treatment strategy. The classification system for EOS, AIS Lenke classification, AdIS classification, and the Scoliosis Research Society-Schwab classification are important for reliable communication between surgeons treating deformities. Untreated progressive idiopathic scoliosis warrants multidisciplinary management during the transition from EOS stage to AIS and then to AdIS. Also, surgical treatment of untreated AIS transitioning to AdIS is specific and nuanced. AdIS needs to be differentiated from adult degenerative scoliosis because the latter is associated with multiple comorbidities and anatomical differences.

Conclusions

Idiopathic scoliosis presents across the age spectrum with specific age-related decisions that transition into adulthood. Integrated models of both surgical and nonsurgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis are warranted.

### Idiopathic scoliosis [^3b8ebec5]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) most commonly develops during adolescence, but may present at any age from infancy through adulthood. Patients with IS are evaluated clinically and radiographically to determine whether the deformity is, in fact, idiopathic, to elucidate any symptoms related to the scoliosis, and to characterize the deformity itself. In patients who have not yet reached skeletal maturity, the treatment of IS is often prophylactic, with the aim of preventing the curve from reaching a magnitude that would make continued progression in adulthood likely. Adult patients with IS are most frequently treated because of symptoms, usually back or leg pain. IS is typically treated with anterior or posterior spinal fusion; treatment of very young patients is complicated by the need to allow growth to continue while controlling the scoliosis.

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^ddd0f1df]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

This prospective cohort study was conducted according to the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational studies. The University Medical Center Utrecht functions as the national referral center in The Netherlands for patients with 22q11.2DS; these patients are followed at regular multidisciplinary outpatient clinic visits from first diagnosis until adulthood. All of the caregivers are asked for broad consent to anonymously use data from the patient charts for research. From the age of 6 years, all patients with 22q11.2DS are screened for orthopaedic manifestations of scoliosis with radiographs (including anterioposterior and lateral full-spine views) once every 2 years. The institutional review board approved an exemption from individual informed consent for this study. We aimed to include 50 consecutive eligible patients aged 8 to 13 years who were skeletally immature (Risser stages 0 and 1) and had no scoliosis at first presentation (Cobb angle of < 10°), as shown on their standing coronal full-spine radiographs. We followed patients at least once every 2 years until they reached skeletal maturity (Risser stages 3 to 5). We excluded patients with additional genetic syndromes, congenital vertebral anomalies, or other orthopaedic manifestations influencing the spine or posture, as well as those who were undergoing growth hormone therapy and those who had undergone spine surgery; patients with insufficient radiographic examinations also were excluded.

### A validated composite model to predict risk of curve progression in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^f21fef9f]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a rotational spinal deformity occurring predominantly in 10–13 years old girls with a global prevalence of 1–4%. Severe spinal deformity in AIS is associated with functional morbidities, cardiopulmonary compromise, early spinal degenerative changes and psychosocial disturbance. Owing to unclear aetiology and pathogenesis, bracing, scoliosis-specific exercisesand instrumental surgical correction are the only available evidence-based treatment regimes targeting the structural deformity rather than the cause. Cobb angles greater than 40–45° have been considered as threshold for surgical correction; and bracing treatment is recommended to patients with AIS with Cobb angles of 20–40°. Currently, younger chronological/skeletal age of patient at presentation, greater initial spine curvature, later onset of menarche are clinical features associated with higher chance of curve progression. Previous systemic review on predictors with pooled prognostic characteristics for curvature progression in AIS indicated limited clinical application and low level of evidence. Therefore, a search for a reliable predictive model for curve progression to severe spinal deformity (Cobb angle of 40°) that would require timely treatment has been an outstanding clinical challenge in the management of AIS.

Since the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by Sharma et al. hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been reported in various cohorts comparing AIS and control populations but the majority of them are not replicable in different ethnic groups, and their biological functions in AIS remains unclear. A genetic based prognostic test consisting of a 53-gene panel called ScolioScore has been proposed to identify patients with AIS at low risk of curve progression, but its predictive value is limited. Follow-up replication studies conducted by Tangand Ogurawere not able to find the association between the 53 SNPs and curve progression or curve occurrence in French-Canadian and Japanese population, respectively. There is increasing evidence showing heterogeneous curve magnitudes and apical levels in twin studies, suggesting the determinant roles of non-genetic factors in curve progression. These observations led to the development of a conceptual complex disease model: a genetic-dependent initiation phase and a progression phase mediated by undefined environmental factors.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: common questions and answers [^16c12b98]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis affects 1% to 3% of U.S. adolescents. It is defined by a lateral curvature of the spine (Cobb angle) of at least 10 degrees in the absence of underlying congenital or neuromuscular abnormalities. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may be detected via the forward bend test and should be confirmed with scoliometer measurement. Mild scoliosis is usually asymptomatic; it may contribute to musculoskeletal back pain, but there is no evidence that it causes disability or functional impairment. Patients with severe scoliosis (Cobb angle of 40 degrees or more) may have physical pain, cosmetic deformity, psychosocial distress, or, rarely, pulmonary disorders. Several studies have shown modest benefit from bracing and scoliosis-specific physical therapy to limit progression in mild to moderate scoliosis, but there were no effects on quality of life. Because no high-quality studies have proven that surgery is superior to bracing or observation, it should be reserved for severe cases. There is little evidence that treatments improve patient-oriented outcomes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents 10 to 18 years of age.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaScoliosis-child [^c1d5d58d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Scoliosis is frequently encountered in childhood, with prevalence of 2%. The majority is idiopathic, without vertebral segmentation anomaly, dysraphism, neuromuscular abnormality, skeletal dysplasia, tumor, or infection. As a complement to clinical assessment, radiography is the primary imaging modality used to classify scoliosis and subsequently monitor its progression and response to treatment. MRI is utilized selectively to assess for neural axis abnormalities in those at higher risk, including those with congenital scoliosis, early onset idiopathic scoliosis, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with certain risk factors. CT, although not routinely employed in the initial evaluation of scoliosis, may have a select role in characterizing the bone anomalies of congenital scoliosis and in perioperative planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Update on evaluation and treatment of scoliosis [^c8e32e1d]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Scoliosis is a spinal deformity that can be seen in children of all ages. It is most commonly seen as an adolescent idiopathic condition. Progressive scoliosis between 25° and 45° before skeletal and physiologic maturity can be treated with a brace, whereas progressive scoliosis greater than 50° should be treated surgically. For children younger than 10 years, it is important to not only prevent scoliosis from worsening but to also maintain the growth of the spine and chest wall through the use of growth-friendly surgical techniques. Spinal fusion and instrumentation surgery is generally reserved for adolescent patients.

### The true cost of late presentation in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a 5-year follow-up study [^99d48d02]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most prevalent pediatric spinal condition. During growth, moderate scoliosis is treated with a brace to minimize the risk of progression to the surgical range. However, a minority of patients meet brace indications, with a greater number presenting late, already appropriate for surgery. This study determines the treatment cost differential between brace candidates and late-presenting patients within a public health care setting.

This is a retrospective review of 373 consecutive AIS patients seen for initial consultation in 2014 and followed for 5 years, with a cost-analysis of the 166 patients that either met brace indications (n = 63) or presented late (n = 103). Patients meeting the Scoliosis Research Society's brace indications presented with a coronal curve magnitude between 25 and 40 degrees inclusive and were skeletally immature with a Risser ≤ 2. Late-presenting patients had coronal curve magnitudes of ≥ 50 degrees (n = 73) or were presented with coronal curve magnitudes of > 40 degrees and were skeletally immature with Risser ≤ 2 (n = 30). Total treatment cost was estimated for 3 scenarios: (1) use of predetermined cut points for treatment prescription, (2) real-world approximation reflecting actual, nuanced clinical decision-making, and (3) the ideal situation, such that all late patients were instead seen as brace candidates.

Results

Each patient who was prescribed a brace and avoided progression to the surgical range saved $23,000 in treatment costs. Eliminating late presentation of AIS would save at least $2 to $3 million per year at a single institution.

Conclusion

Significant cost savings can be found by optimizing the number of patients treated with a brace and minimizing the number of patients that present late as likely surgical candidates. This study provides financial impetus for early AIS detection, decreasing the number of avoidable surgeries. Scoliosis screening recommendations in primary care should be re-examined, alongside the development of educational tools, equipping primary care providers, and youth and their caregivers with appropriate knowledge on how to identify AIS.

### Spinal manifestations of skeletal dysplasia: a practical guide for clinical diagnosis [^d719116d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Skeletal dysplasias are a group of genetic conditions defined by atypical bone or cartilage growth and development. Skeletal abnormalities include short stature, limb deformity, joint contracture, and spinal deformity. Over 90% of disorders have a known genetic mutation that can definitively determine the diagnosis. As patients may present with a primary spinal concern, a careful clinical and radiographic evaluation can allow the physician to develop a working diagnosis to guide additional evaluation. Spinal manifestations include scoliosis and kyphoscoliosis, cervical instability, cervical kyphosis, thoracolumbar kyphosis, spinal stenosis, and atypical vertebral body morphology. An understanding of the affected conditions, prevalence, and natural history of these radiographic findings aids the orthopaedic surgeon in establishing a diagnosis and guides appropriate orthopaedic care.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^8d8eab8e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis:

- **Definition**: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine, characterized by a lateral curvature of the spine > 10 degrees, as measured via the Cobb angle. This condition typically presents in otherwise normal individuals aged 10–18 years with no identifiable cause.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis remains unclear, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, biomechanical, and neurological factors. Abnormalities in the growth of vertebrae and the surrounding soft tissues may lead to asymmetric spinal growth, resulting in curvature. Genetic factors have been implicated, with disease-causing and predisposing variants of SLC6A9 encoding the glycine transporter 1 (GLYT1) and susceptibility loci on chromosome 10q24.31, identified in some patients. Additionally, abnormalities in brain development and cerebral cortical thinning have been suggested as potential contributing factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in the US is estimated at 522.5 per 100,000 person-years. The prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis globally is estimated at 0.47–5.2%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis include a family history of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, female sex, and vitamin D deficiency.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may be asymptomatic or present with cosmetic concerns, back pain, or respiratory issues in severe cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Some scoliosis curves remain stable, while others progress, particularly in patients with larger initial curves or those diagnosed at a younger age. The prognosis is generally favorable for mild curves, with many patients experiencing minimal impact on QoL. Curves with a Cobb angle of 10–19 degrees typically need only observation, while bracing and physical therapy can be considered for curves of 20–29 degrees and are recommended for those of 30–39 degrees. Significant curves (> 40 degrees) may require surgical intervention to prevent progression and associated complications.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: review and current concepts [^e279b87f]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is present in 2 to 4 percent of children between 10 and 16 years of age. It is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees accompanied by vertebral rotation. It is thought to be a multigene dominant condition with variable phenotypic expression. Scoliosis can be identified by the Adam's forward bend test during physical examination. Severe pain, a left thoracic curve or an abnormal neurologic examination are red flags that point to a secondary cause for spinal deformity. Specialty consultation and magnetic resonance imaging are needed if red flags are present. Of adolescents diagnosed with scoliosis, only 10 percent have curves that progress and require medical intervention. The main risk factors for curve progression are a large curve magnitude, skeletal immaturity and female gender. The likelihood of curve progression can be estimated by measuring the curve magnitude using the Cobb method on radiographs and by assessing skeletal growth potential using Tanner staging and Risser grading.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: interdisciplinary creative art practice and nature connections [^adf29fce]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite it not being rare, people either have little knowledge of scoliosis and/or it is poorly understood. An abnormal lateral and twisting curvature of the spine, scoliosis affects circa three per cent of the population and can occur in infancy, early childhood or later in life. However, it is most frequently diagnosed in early adolescence with onset commonly occurring between 10 years and 12 years of age. When other causes are rejected, idiopathic scoliosis is the diagnosis attributed to around 80% of all cases. In general, five out of six cases are female with the American Association of Neurological Surgeons reporting that women are eight times more likely to progress to a curve magnitude that requires treatment. The degree of curvature, measured using the Cobb 1 method, dictates the treatment plan; a scoliosis curve of 10°–15° would generally trigger monitoring.

Scoliosis can be slow, it can take many years for it to reveal the full impact that it may have on the life of an individual and those they share their lives with. Conversely, the degree of change can be rapid with surgery proposed before the individual has had a chance to fully register and understand their diagnosis. In essence, clinicians, individuals and families wait to see what will happen as the magnitude of the developing curve is disclosed over an unpredictable period of time. A treatment plan is determined by ongoing clinical and radiological mapping in the form of standing spinal X-rays, the frequency of which is dictated by the speed at which the curve appears to be progressing. This takes place until puberty is complete and the individual has stopped growing as commonly the curve does not deteriorate beyond puberty. A curve measurement of 25°–30° is widely accepted as significant with curves in excess of 40° considered to be severe, prompting clinical discussions regarding the need for surgical intervention. Despite reports that differing interpretations of the radiological information can lead to contrary Cobb angles, the system remains the most widely used method to calculate the amount of spinal deformity. Our study concentrated on two highlighted priorities from the Scoliosis Priority Setting Partnership: (1) How is quality of life affected by scoliosis and its treatment? How can we measure this in ways that are meaningful to patients? (2) How are the psychological impacts (including on body image) of diagnosis and treatment best managed?

### Profound hypoxemia and hypotension during posterior spinal fusion in a spinal muscular atrophy child with severe scoliosis: a case report [^529bea49]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Informed consent for publication including identifying information/images was obtained from the patient's legal guardian. A 13-yr-old girl with severe kyphoscoliosis was scheduled for elective posterior spinal fusion surgery. She presented symptoms of muscle weakness, difficulty in sitting and holding up the head, hyporeflexia, and growth retardation at 9 months of age. Genetic analysis showed homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene and 3 copies of SMN2 gene, and she was diagnosed as SMA type 2. She developed progressive scoliosis and kyphosis at the age of eight.

The girl had no history of other surgeries and had not received general anesthesia previously. On physical examination, she had significant muscle weakness and was unable to sit without support. In addition to severe kyphoscoliosis, the girl has multiple joint contractures including flexion deformities of elbows, wrists, hips, and knees. Her preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no spinal cord or other soft tissue abnormalities other than scoliosis. For preoperative evaluation, though without history of recurrent pulmonary infection, her preoperative computed tomography (CT) showed thoracic asymmetry, bronchial stenosis in the middle and inferior lobes of the right lung, and atelectasis of the inferior lobe of the right lung (Fig. 1). She had poor pulmonary function (FEV1 0.39 L, FVC 0.44 L) and had been treated with nocturnal noninvasive ventilation for two years. Also, because of difficulties in mouth opening and chewing caused by muscle atrophy and temporomandibular joint contracture, the girl had to take semisolid food and had severe dysplasia (weight 20 kg, height 100 cm). To optimize her preoperative status, multidisciplinary team was consulted. A physiatrist guided her respiratory prehabilitation preoperatively. The parameters for noninvasive ventilation were optimized by a respirologist. Her arterial blood gas (pH 7.39, PaO 2 81mmHg, PaCO 2 44mmHg) was acceptable prior to surgery. She had normal electrocardiogram and echocardiography otherwise. A nutritionist assessed her nutritional status and formulated nutritional treatment, including setting daily caloric goals with oral nutrition supplements and enhancing protein intake. Halo-gravity traction had been applied to control the progression of scoliosis for one year. For SMA treatment, she had received 6 doses of intrathecal injection of Nusinersen prior to surgery. After the above preoperative optimization, considering her kyphoscoliosis progressed rapidly despite conservative treatment (Cobb's angle 125° for thoracic scoliosis and 122° for kyphosis preoperatively, Fig. 1), posterior spinal fusion was decided to be performed.

### The adult scoliosis [^38674b80]. European Spine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Adult scoliosis is defined as a spinal deformity in a skeletally mature patient with a Cobb angle of more than 10 degrees in the coronal plain. Adult scoliosis can be separated into four major groups: Type 1: Primary degenerative scoliosis, mostly on the basis of a disc and/or facet joint arthritis, affecting those structures asymmetrically with predominantly back pain symptoms, often accompanied either by signs of spinal stenosis (central as well as lateral stenosis) or without. These curves are often classified as "de novo" scoliosis. Type 2: Idiopathic adolescent scoliosis of the thoracic and/or lumbar spine which progresses in adult life and is usually combined with secondary degeneration and/or imbalance. Some patients had either no surgical treatment or a surgical correction and fusion in adolescence in either the thoracic or thoracolumbar spine. Those patients may develop secondary degeneration and progression of the adjacent curve; in this case those curves belong to the type 3a. Type 3: Secondary adult curves: (a) In the context of an oblique pelvis, for instance, due to a leg length discrepancy or hip pathology or as a secondary curve in idiopathic, neuromuscular and congenital scoliosis, or asymmetrical anomalies at the lumbosacral junction; (b) In the context of a metabolic bone disease (mostly osteoporosis) combined with asymmetric arthritic disease and/or vertebral fractures. Sometimes it is difficult to decide, what exactly the primary cause of the curve was, once it has significantly progressed. However, once an asymmetric load or degeneration occurs, the pathomorphology and pathomechanism in adult scoliosis predominantly located in the lumbar or thoracolumbar spine is quite predictable. Asymmetric degeneration leads to increased asymmetric load and therefore to a progression of the degeneration and deformity, as either scoliosis and/or kyphosis. The progression of a curve is further supported by osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal female patients. The destruction of facet joints, joint capsules, discs and ligaments may create mono- or multisegmental instability and finally spinal stenosis. These patients present themselves predominantly with back pain, then leg pain and claudication symptoms, rarely with neurological deficit, and almost never with questions related to cosmetics. The diagnostic evaluation includes static and dynamic imaging, myelo-CT, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures like discograms, facet blocks, epidural and root blocks and immobilization tests. These tests may correlate with the clinical and the pathomorphological findings and may also offer the least invasive and most rational treatment for the patient. The treatment is then tailored to the specific symptomatology of the patient. Surgical management consists of either decompression, correction, stabilization and fusion procedures or a combination of all of these. Surgical procedure is usually complex and has to deal with a whole array of specific problems like the age and the general medical condition of the patient, the length of the fusion, the condition of the adjacent segments, the condition of the lumbosacral junction, osteoporosis and possibly previous scoliosis surgery, and last but not least, usually with a long history of chronified back pain and muscle imbalance which may be very difficult to be influenced. Although this surgery is demanding, the morbidity cannot be considered significantly higher than in other established orthopaedic procedures, like hip replacement, in the same age group of patients. Overall, a satisfactory outcome can be expected in well-differentiated indications and properly tailored surgical procedures, although until today prospective, controlled studies with outcome measures and pre- and post-operative patient's health status are lacking. As patients, who present themselves with significant clinical problems in the context of adult scoliosis, get older, minimal invasive procedures to address exactly the most relevant clinical problem may become more and more important, basically ignoring the overall deformity and degeneration of the spine.

### Hyperkyphosis as an indicator of syringomyelia in idiopathic scoliosis: a case report [^284ba62f]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case of thoracic hyperkyphosis is reported as an atypical presentation of otherwise typical adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that showed a large syringomyelia on magnetic resonance imaging. OBJECTIVE To review atypical curve patterns that indicate the need for more intensive preoperative workup including a magnetic resonance imaging scan.

Summary Of Background Data

The literature on atypical curve patterns of adolescent "non-idiopathic" scoliosis is reviewed. No report in the literature describes patients with an idiopathic coronal plane and thoracic hyperkyphosis as an atypical feature found to have a large syringomyelia and Chiari I malformation on magnetic resonance imaging examination.

Methods

The clinical and radiographic features associated with thoracic hyperkyphosis and juvenile and adolescent scoliosis with syringomyelia are presented.

Results

The neurosurgical treatment of the syringomyelia subsequently led to a potentially safer spinal fusion. The patient tolerated the procedures well and at this writing has remained asymptomatic during 3 years of follow-up evaluation.

Conclusions

The reported case adds to the hyperkyphosis literature category of unusual spinal deformities seen in scoliosis associated with syringomyelia and should further help to categorize adolescent idiopathic scoliosis as a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: diagnosis and management [^63c29d30]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form of scoliosis, affecting approximately 2% to 4% of adolescents. The incidence of scoliosis is about the same in males and females; however, females have up to a 10-fold greater risk of curve progression. Although most youths with scoliosis will not develop clinical symptoms, scoliosis can progress to rib deformity and respiratory compromise, and can cause significant cosmetic problems and emotional distress for some patients. For decades, scoliosis screenings were a routine part of school physical examinations in adolescents. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend against routine scoliosis screening in asymptomatic adolescents, concluding that harm from screening outweighs the benefit because screenings expose many low-risk adolescents to unnecessary radiographs and referrals. In contrast, the Scoliosis Research Society, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America suggest that the potential benefit of detecting scoliosis early justifies screening programs, but greater care should be used in deciding which patients with positive screening results need further evaluation. The goal for primary care physicians is to identify patients who are at risk of developing problems from scoliosis, without overtesting or overreferring patients who are unlikely to have further problems. Physical examination with the Adam's forward bend test and a scoliometer measurement can guide judicious use of radiologic testing for Cobb angle measurement and orthopedic referrals. Treatment options include observation, braces, and surgery.

Patient 4 in Family 3

Patient 4, a 13-year-old boy, had been prone to falling since approximately 3 years of age. Additionally, muscle weakness was noted. Physical examinations revealed normal upper-limb muscle strength but predominant weakness and atrophy in the bilateral distal lower-limb muscles. Patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were diminished, Babinski and Chaddock reflexes were negative, and no pyramidal tract signs were noted. Although he could initially walk unaided with steppage gait, he subsequently lost the ability to walk. Despite his ability to breathe spontaneously during the day, he requires a ventilator at night. Dysphagia was also identified; however, his intellectual ability was normal. Tight and curled hair (kinky hair-like) and scoliosis were noted. Electrophysiologic examination revealed sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy with sensory nerve dominance. Head MRI disclosed periventricular white matter lesions and T2-weighted hyperintensities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres at 8 years of age (Fig. 2 A–C). At 13 years of age, his white matter lesions were enlarged, and widespread cerebral atrophy was observed.

### Surgical sagittal correction of symptomatic sweeping thoracolumbar lordosis in an adolescent with congenital kyphoscoliosis [^e20835dc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital kyphoscoliosis is a rare spinal deformity characterized by abnormal curvature in both the sagittal and coronal planes due to vertebral malformations. It often presents in early childhood and can progress during growth spurts. Typical symptoms include back pain and visible spinal deformity, which may impede physical activities and, in severe cases, affect respiratory function. The timing of surgical intervention in congenital kyphoscoliosis remains a topic of debate, with considerations ranging from early correction to delay until notable symptoms arise. Current literature describes various management strategies, including observation, bracing treatment, and surgical intervention, with posterior spinal fusion being a common approach to correct severe deformities and prevent additional progression. - This case is particularly notable because of the symptomatic compensatory thoracolumbar lordosis serving as an indication for posterior column osteotomies and posterior spinal fusion.

### Idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents: assessment with a biplanar X-ray device [^73039b77]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Scoliosis is defined on radiographs by the presence of one or more lateral curvatures of the spine in the coronal plane, greater than 10° as measured by the Cobb method. There are no identifiable causes for this condition in about 80% of cases and, in particular, no evidence of congenital, developmental or neuromuscular abnormalities. On the basis of patient's age and clinical features, idiopathic scoliosis is categorised as infantile (0–3 years) scoliosis (male predominance, levoscoliosis more frequent), juvenile (4–10 years) scoliosis (female predominance, dextroscoliosis more frequent) and adolescent (11–18 years) scoliosis (female predominance, dextroscoliosis more frequent).

Radiography is the mainstay to confirm the diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis in excluding underlying causes (e.g. segmentation abnormalities), to characterise the type of spinal curvature(s), determine the flexibility of the curvature(s), follow disease progression and monitor treatment. Standard evaluation consists of standing frontal radiographs of the entire spine (either anteroposterior [AP] views in males or posteroanterior [PA] views in females in order to reduce the radiation dose to the breasts), sometimes completed by lateral radiographs. However, radiography has two main disadvantages. Firstly, repeated examinations (it is estimated that a typical scoliosis patient will have approximately 22 radiological examinations over a 3-year treatment period) are responsible for an increased amount of radiation exposure and, particularly in young females, an increased risk of breast cancer or infertility. Secondly, scoliosis corresponds in reality to a complex three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the spine that simple two-dimensional (2D) radiographs are unable to assess precisely.

### Neuromuscular scoliosis: when, who, why and outcomes [^4c48f7ea]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Scoliosis has a very high prevalence among patients with neuromuscular disease involving the thoracic spine and truncal muscles. Physical examination and radiographs are used to screen for presence of scoliosis and monitor progression. Management includes therapy participation, optimizing equipment and orthotic use, and possible surgical intervention. Unlike idiopathic adolescent scoliosis, curves tend to progress despite orthotic use compliance. Associated pelvic obliquity creates risk for pressure sores and pain. As such, education of caregivers is a key point of optimizing management.

### Profound hypoxemia and hypotension during posterior spinal fusion in a spinal muscular atrophy child with severe scoliosis: a case report [^5786c061]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Anesthesia for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery is challenging. We report an unusual case of an SMA girl who developed severe intraoperative hypoxemia and hypotension during posterior spinal fusion related with surgical positioning.

Case Presentation

A 13-yr-old girl diagnosed with SMA type 2, severe kyphoscoliosis and thoracic deformity was scheduled for elective posterior spinal fusion. She developed severe hypoxemia and profound hypotension intraoperatively in the prone position with surgical table tilted 45° to the right. Though transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) could not be performed due to limited mouth opening, her preoperative computed tomography revealed a severely distorted thoracic cavity with much reduced volume of the right side. A reasonable explanation was when the surgeons performed surgical procedure with the tilted surgical table, the pressure was directly put on the shortest diameter of the significantly deformed thoracic cavity, causing severe compression of the pulmonary artery, resulting in both hypoxemia and hypotension. The patient stabilized when the surgical table was tilted back and successfully went through the surgery in the leveled prone position.

Conclusions

Spinal fusion surgery is beneficial for SMA patients in preventing scoliosis progression and improving ventilation. However, severe scoliosis and thoracic deformities put them at risk of both hemodynamic and respiratory instability during surgical positioning. When advanced monitoring like TEE is not practical intraoperatively, preoperative imaging may help with differential diagnosis, and guide the surgical positioning to minimize mechanical compression of the thoracic cavity, thereby helping the patient complete the surgery safely.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: radiologic decision-making [^c0b9a53c]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Adolescent onset of severe idiopathic scoliosis has traditionally been evaluated using standing posteroanterior radiographs of the full spine to assess lateral curvature with the Cobb method. The most tilted vertebral bodies above and below the apex of the spinal curve are used to create intersecting lines that give the curve degree. This definition is controversial, and patients do not exhibit clinically significant respiratory symptoms with idiopathic scoliosis until their curves are 60 to 100 degrees. There is no difference in the prevalence of back pain or mortality between patients with untreated adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and the general population. Therefore, many patients referred to physicians for evaluation of scoliosis do not need radiographic evaluation, back examinations, or treatment. Consensus recommendations for population screening, evaluation, and treatment of this disorder by medical organizations vary widely. Recent studies cast doubt on the clinical value of school-based screening programs.

Congenital scoliosis is not normally associated with pain in young children. We are presenting two cases of young patients with congenital scoliosis and moderate to severe pain. There were no spinal cord abnormalities found in these patients. The magnetic resonance imaging and CT scan revealed disc degeneration with Modic changes at the apex of the congenital scoliosis. We hypothesized that the mechanical instability resulting from poor spinal element formations associated with congenital scoliosis was responsible for causing the disc degeneration and endplate changes. Modic changes have been reported to be associated with pain in degenerative conditions of the spine. Both patients underwent a posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation, which relieved their pain immediately.

### Progressive scoliosis in cri-du-chat syndrome over a 20-year follow-up period: a case report [^e317679a]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A long-term follow-up study of a patient who had scoliosis associated with cri-du-chat syndrome was performed.

Objective

To describe for the first time the characteristics and natural course of progressive scoliosis in a patient with cri-du-chat syndrome.

Summary Of Background Data

Scoliosis is a common condition in patients with cri-du-chat syndrome. However, there are no reports on the clinical characteristics and course of this spinal deformity.

Methods

The current condition and radiographs of a 33-year-old man with cri-du-chat syndrome were assessed. The records and serial radiographs of his spine were reviewed retrospectively over a 29-year period, between ages 4 and 33 years.

Results

The scoliosis had started before the initial radiographic examination and progressed rapidly during the growth period. After this stage, slow but continuous progression was observed over the next 10 years. The final curvature was quite substantial, measuring 119 degrees.

Conclusions

To determine the most appropriate treatment for the scoliosis associated with cri-du-chat syndrome, the characteristics and natural course of the scoliosis should be clarified. Although this first report on this type of scoliosis is informative, more cases and further studies are needed.

### Resection of a pediatric intramedullary spinal cord tumor: 2-dimensional operative video [^77b40db0]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

This video is a case presentation and demonstration of surgical approach to a pediatric intramedullary spinal cord tumor (IMSCT). IMSCT can be associated with significant morbidity and aggressive resection is associated with more favorable long-term outcome. A 13-yr-old male presented to clinic for evaluation of rapidly progressive scoliosis to the left. A contrasted MRI revealed expansion of the spinal cord with edema from approximately T3 to T9 and an enhancing lesion at T6-7 associated with a small cyst. On neurological exam, the patient had good strength throughout, but decreased sensation in the T7-12 dermatomes and decreased deep tendon reflexes in his lower extremities. The procedure included T5 to T8 osteoplastic laminectomies and IMSCT resection followed by spinal reconstruction. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to verify the tumor's location and somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were monitored throughout the procedure. Intraoperative consultation with neuropathology suggested the mass was likely pilocytic astrocytoma; therefore, it was aggressively debulked using microsurgical techniques including an ultrasonic aspirator. There was a plane between the tumor and spinal cord white matter allowing for a gross total resection. Postoperatively the patient had good strength throughout and sensation was intact except for continued numbness of the anterior thigh bilaterally. Immediate postoperative MRI demonstrated complete resection of the tumor without residual enhancement and the patient was ultimately discharged home on postoperative day 8. Follow-up imaging remained stable at 2 mo and the patient continued to do well neurologically. All patient identifiers were removed from the presented material, thus, patient consent was not obtained.

Introduction: Back pain is a relatively common presenting symptom in children and adolescents. Typical causes include spinal deformities (such as scoliosis), spondylolysis, bulging or herniated intervertebral disks, functional pain (such as fibromyalgia), spondylodiscitis, post-traumatic injuries, benign or malignant tumors, osteomyelitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common panniculitis in childhood. EN lesions are localized at lower limbs in particular on the pretibial region, upper limbs and trunk are rarely involved. EN can be associated with general symptoms such as fever, weakness, sever pain, but skin lesions resolve without skin damage. EN can be associated with infectious diseases (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Chlamydia and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis), inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, rheumatologic diseases, malignant tumors.

Objectives: To report the case of a 9-year-old patient with back pain and erythema nodosum. To report the case of a 9-year-old patient with back pain.

Methods: A 9-year-old girl comes to our Department because of back pain and asthenia. Two weeks before the back pain onset the patient got a trauma due to a fall from a swing. Then the patient presented fever (with a temperature up to 38 ° Celsius) for 2–3 days, associated with epistaxis, asthenia and lumbar pain. At first these symptoms were treated with non steroidal antinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since symptoms got worse she underwent to an orthopedic evaluation that found scoliosis in dorsal and lumbar column and bilateral valgus foot. For the persistence of both back pain and asthenia the patient came to our Department. Our clinical examination revealed: pain in lumbosacral column and on the pressure of the right sacroiliac joint; erythema nodosum on the pretibial region of the left lower limb.

### Spinal osteochondroma presenting as atypical spinal curvature: a case report [^6dac5a48]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

The case of an 8-year-old girl with hereditary multiple exostosis presenting with atypical spinal curvature is reported.

Objective

To describe a case of spinal curvature caused by an osteochondroma, illustrating the need for careful evaluation of patients with hereditary multiple exostosis presenting with "scoliosis".

Summary Of Background Data

Osteochondromas have been known to arise in the spinal canal and to present with symptoms of neural compression. Spinal curvature is a rare presenting sign of osteochondromas.

Methods

The patient's medical and radiographic history is reviewed as well as the medical literature.

Results

An 8-year-old girl with hereditary multiple exostosis was referred for possible thoracotomy and anterior decompression of a T4 osteochondroma thought to be causing an atypical "scoliosis". Further examination, review of the radiographs, and computed tomography scan showed a large L4 osteochondroma encroaching on the neural elements. The patient's neurologic symptoms and spinal curvature resolved in the 2 years after surgical excision of the lumbar osteochondroma.

Conclusions

Patients with hereditary multiple exostosis and spinal curvature require further diagnostic evaluation to ensure that an osteochondroma in the spinal canal is not the cause of that curvature.

### Different curve pattern and other radiographical characteristics in male and female patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^80624a04]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective radiographical study.

Objective

To compare the sex differences in curve patterns and radiographical characteristics in patients who have adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

Summary Of Background Data

Sex differences in AIS have been documented in the incidence of curve progression, response to bracing, and outcomes of surgical treatment. However, limited information is available about the relation between sex and scoliosis curve patterns and radiographical presentations.

Methods

A total of 359 male and 999 female patients with AIS with major curve of 20° or more were recruited. Standard posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of spine were reviewed to classify scoliosis curve patterns as typical or atypical and to measure curve severity and thoracic kyphosis. In 351 surgically treated patients, side-bending films were used to assess curve flexibility. Comparisons between male and female patients were made by subgrouping patients according to curve patterns and severity.

Results

Atypical curves were more frequently observed in male (19.8%) than in female patients (8.9%) (P < 0.01). Sex differences were also found in the distribution of curve types. Main thoracic curve was the most common curve type in both sexes. Furthermore, significantly higher incidence of main thoracic curve in patients with severe AIS than in patients with moderate AIS was found in male (P < 0.001) but not in female patients. In patients with severe AIS who had typical curve patterns that included a major thoracic curve, male patients had larger magnitude of thoracic curve, more severe thoracic kyphosis, and more rigid thoracic and lumbar curves than female patients.

Conclusion

Atypical curve patterns were more predominant in male than in female patients with AIS. The thoracic curve in male patients with AIS might have higher incidence of progression than that in female patients. The higher rigidity of both thoracic and lumbar curves in male patients with AIS with severe curves might contribute to the lower curve correction rate and poor response to brace than in female cases.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^a98ba34e]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of structural spinal deformities that have a radiological lateral Cobb angle - a measure of spinal curvature - of ≥ 10(°). AIS affects between 1% and 4% of adolescents in the early stages of puberty and is more common in young women than in young men. The condition occurs in otherwise healthy individuals and currently has no recognizable cause. In the past few decades, considerable progress has been made towards understanding the clinical patterns and the three-dimensional pathoanatomy of AIS. Advances in biomechanics and technology and their clinical application, supported by limited evidence-based research, have led to improvements in the safety and outcomes of surgical and non-surgical treatments. However, the definite aetiology and aetiopathogenetic mechanisms that underlie AIS are still unclear. Thus, at present, both the prevention of AIS and the treatment of its direct underlying cause are not possible.

### Selective screening for scoliosis [^9b973c8c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Scoliosis screening has been practiced for nearly 50 years and has provided valuable knowledge about the prevalence and natural history of scoliosis. Early diagnosis allows for nonoperative treatment, like wearing an orthosis that has been shown to be effective by numerous outcome studies. Challenges in scoliosis screening include the low prevalence rate of clinically significant scoliosis, the inverse relationship of sensitivity and specificity in the screening process because of the poor correlation of clinical deformity and radiographic abnormality, and the inflated cost of these programs because of overreferral. Recommendations for improvement include redefinition of what actually constitutes a "significant" scoliosis for screening, diagnostic, and outcome purposes; selective screening of only immature females; the use of objective referral criteria; and re-screening patients rather than referring those who have borderline cases.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: 5-year to 20-year evidence-based surgical results [^76c90a35]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2010). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) should be proven to alter the natural history without introducing iatrogenic complications. The risks of surgery should be substantiated by a body of scientific research, which should show a clear superiority of surgery over observation, both in the short term and the long term. The purpose of this review was to conduct a systematic search of the literature to critically evaluate the scientific evidence on the long-term outcomes and complications of surgical intervention for AIS. Our search identified 39 distinct patient populations with a minimum average follow-up of 5 years. No long-term, prospective controlled studies exist to support the hypothesis that surgical intervention for AIS is superior to natural history. Although surgery reliably arrests the progression of deformity, achieves permanent correction, and improves appearance, there is no medical necessity for surgery based on the current body of literature. However, the surgeon must not underestimate the psychological indication that occurs when a patient is no longer able to cope with the deformity.

### A new complication of spinal fusion surgery for neuromuscular scoliosis-posterior mediastinal hematoma: case report [^6801cf04]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE:

Neuromuscular scoliosis surgery is affiliated with a high risk of perioperative and postoperative complications. We present the case of a never-before-reported complication: a posterior mediastinal hematoma.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:

We present the case of a 17-year-old female patient with cerebral palsy and neuromuscular scoliosis with a progressive thoracic kyphosis to 85° and levoscoliosis to 13.5° who presented for spinal fusion surgery. Postoperatively, the patient developed persistent tachycardia despite initial resuscitation, anxiolysis, and analgesia. A computed tomography scan was obtained revealing a posterior mediastinal hematoma. The patient was managed with supportive care and recovered well.

CONCLUSION:

This case highlights a never-before-reported complication of spinal fusion surgery: a posterior mediastinal hematoma. Although unlikely symptomatic, a posterior mediastinal hematoma should be on the differential diagnosis for postoperative tachycardia. This case entreats us to elucidate the true incidence rate of this complication in the population.

### Surgical management of neuromuscular scoliosis in paediatric patients: experiences from a tertiary centre multidisciplinary team [^208283ef]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) presents as a clinical complication in children with a variety of medical conditions experiencing impairments of muscle control. These conditions may range from neuromuscular weakness, such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, to diseases of the central nervous system, such as cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental and genetic disorders. Compared with idiopathic scoliosis (the most common type of spinal deformity), NMS is associated with significant morbidity and often an unfavourable prognosis. If left untreated, scoliosis can contribute to progressive restrictive lung disease, chronic back pain, poor posture and diminished self-esteem.

Management of patients with NMS is challenging due to the often high number of comorbidities and must strike a careful balance between reducing discomfort (eg, through improved sitting posture) and the risk of complications associated with spinal surgery. Currently, the mainstay non-surgical strategy for managing NMS is bracing. While bracing can improve sitting position in some patients, its effect on curve progression is minimal, acting primarily as an external support for balance. As such, surgical intervention is regarded as the definitive management. Published outcomes of scoliosis surgery report high patient satisfaction rates and improved quality of life, but its effect on lung function remains an area of ongoing research. Some studies indicate lung function improvement at long-term follow-up, while others report no significant change or even a decline in lung function after surgery. Moreover, these procedures come with risks and limitations, such as postoperative mobility constraints.

### Scoliosis in Proteus syndrome: case report [^d0f7c6ac]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

The case of patient with scoliosis based on a rare hamartomatous, Proteus syndrome, is reported.

Objectives

To present the characteristics of scoliosis associated with Proteus syndrome, and to investigate the mechanisms that cause it.

Summary Of Background Data

Proteus syndrome, a rare hamartomatous disorder first coined by Wiedemann, manifests many clinical morphologic abnormalities including scoliosis. The characteristics and cause of scoliosis in this syndrome are fully unknown.

Methods

A patient with Proteus syndrome was followed from the age of 3 months to the age of 21 years. This patient received spinal corrective surgery for severe scoliosis. Detailed investigations of the scoliosis as well as the physical and imaging examinations were performed to characterize the scoliosis.

Results

Computed tomography showed exclusive asymmetric appearance of lumbar spine, hypertrophy of the only right facet joints, and pedicles at L1-L4, which accorded with the right-side hemihypertrophy of the patient's extremities.

Conclusions

Scoliosis with Proteus syndrome seems to be based on hemihypertrophy, with no influence of mechanical stress.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

The patient was referred to our hospital at age 7. She was delivered normally at 40 weeks of gestation and had no family history of neuromuscular disease. No abnormal findings were reported during regular antenatal care. Her height and weight at birth were 48 cm and 2696 g, respectively. The patient was found to have scoliosis and hip dislocation at the age of 2 months. She held her head up at 4 months and became ambulatory at 3 years. Though she had contractures of the proximal joints, hyperlaxity of the distal joints was not observed. There was no delay in intellectual development. At presentation, her height and weight were 86.5 cm (−7.0 SD) and 10 kg (−3.2 SD), respectively. Blood chemistry testing revealed that the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase levels were within the normal range. No abnormalities were observed in nerve conduction studies. On muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremities, high intensity on T1‐weighted imaging was observed in the peripheral area of the vastus lateralis (white arrow), soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles (white arrowhead), in addition to the central area of the rectus femoris muscle (black arrowhead) (Box 1; Figure 1A, B).

### Guidelines for management of scoliosis in Rett syndrome patients based on expert consensus and clinical evidence [^d8d1828c]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Modified Delphi technique.

Objective

To develop guidelines for the clinical management of scoliosis in Rett syndrome through evidence review and consensus expert panel opinion.

Summary Of Background Data

Rett syndrome is a rare disorder and clinical expertise is thus with small case series. Scoliosis is a frequent association and the evidence base dealing with scoliosis management in this syndrome is limited. Parents of affected girls and women have expressed needs for more information about scoliosis and Rett syndrome.

Methods

An initial draft of scoliosis guidelines was created based on literature review and open-ended questions where the literature was lacking. Perspectives of four parents of Rett syndrome patients informed this initial draft. Access to an online and a Microsoft Word formatted version of the draft were then sent to an international, multidisciplinary panel of clinicians via e-mail with input sought using a 2-stage modified Delphi process to reach consensus agreement. Items included clinical monitoring and intervention before the diagnosis of scoliosis; monitoring after the diagnosis of scoliosis; imaging; therapy and conservative management; bracing; and preoperative, surgical, and postoperative considerations.

Results

The first draft contained 71 statements, 65 questions. The second draft comprised 88 items with agreement to strong agreement achieved on 85, to form the final guideline document. A comprehensive, life-span approach to the management of scoliosis in Rett syndrome is recommended that takes into account factors such as physical activity, posture, nutritional and bone health needs. Surgery should be considered when the Cobb angle is approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees and must be supported by specialist management of anesthesia, pain control, seizures, and early mobilization.

Conclusion

Evidence- and consensus-based guidelines were successfully created and have the potential to improve care of a complex comorbidity in a rare condition and stimulate research to improve the current limited evidence base.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: diagnosis and management… [^6bc8f9e6]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

1–4 Scoliosis is defined as a lateral curve to the spine that is greater than 10 degrees with vertebral rotation. 1–5 It can be classified as congenital, neuromuscular, or idiopathic; approximately 85% of cases are idiopathic. 1–3, 6 Idiopathic scoliosis can be further classified by age of onset: infantile, juvenile, and adolescent. 1–3, 6 Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form. 1–3, 6, 7 Scoliosis usually does not cause problems, but sometimes leads to visible deformity, emotional distress, and respiratory impairment from rib deformity. 1, 3–5, 7–9 Males and females are about equally likely to have minor scoliosis of approximately 10 degrees, but females are five to 10 times more likely to progress to more severe disease, possibly needing treatment.

Risk Factors for Disease Progression Three major factors that determine whether scoliosis will progress are patient sex, magnitude of curve on presentation, and growth potential. 3, 5, 10, 11 One study followed 186 skeletally immature patients with idiopathic scoliosis, diagnosed through school screening, until skeletal maturity. The initial Cobb angle magnitude was the most important predictor of long-term curve progression and behavior past skeletal maturity, whereas initial age, sex, age of menarche, and pubertal status were less important prognostic factors. The authors suggested an initial Cobb angle of 25 degrees as an important threshold magnitude for long-term curve progression.

### Pulmonary function and exercise capacity in mild early-onset idiopathic scoliosis: a case ‒ control study [^d5120e0e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) is defined as spinal curvature that develops before the age of 10 years. This condition can arise from a variety of etiologies, including congenital anomalies, neuromuscular disorders, scoliosis-associated syndromes (neurofibromatosis), or idiopathic factors. A multicenter retrospective cohort study revealed that the annual incidence of early-onset scoliosis was 0.019%, while its prevalence was 0.077%. Approximately 95% of EOS patients experience progressive scoliotic deformity that worsens with age, with rapid progression often observed during infancy and preschool years. Early-onset idiopathic scoliosis (EOIS) is a subtype of idiopathic scoliosis developing before the age of 10 years, remains responsive to conservative treatment.

As an important indicator of overall health, cardiorespiratory fitness reflects the integrated performance of functional exercise capacity and respiratory function. It is considered one of the five vital signs, playing a role comparable to that of blood pressure and heart rate. Previous studies have demonstrated that scoliosis can cause thoracic structural distortion, abnormal spinal morphology, and secondary impairments in respiratory function and exercise capacity. These changes are likely associated with pathological alterations caused by scoliosis, such as the shortened spinal length and vertebral rotation. The severity of functional impairment correlates positively with the severity of scoliosis deformity, with moderate scoliosis causing greater impairment than mild scoliosis, including cardiopulmonary dysfunction, back pain, cosmetic deformities and neurological compromise. The deformity of EOIS tends to worsen with increasing age, and earlier onset is associated with more significant impacts on lung function and greater treatment challenges. Therefore, early detection of scoliosis complications can help mitigate the impact on healthy development before scoliosis progresses.

From birth to 8–9 years old is a critical period of lung and respiratory system development. If scoliosis develops during this stage, it can significantly impact pulmonary function development. Compared to typical adolescent scoliosis, EOIS occurs at a younger age when the spine is rapidly growing. As spinal deformity progresses, the resulting thoracic deformity can lead to lung function impairment and cardiac damage, further limiting the child's exercise capacity. Research on pulmonary function and exercise capacity in patients with scoliosis has been increasing in recent years, but most studies focused on adolescents or on patients with moderate-to-severe deformities. Patients with EOIS are at higher risk of progression compared to adolescents with scoliosis. The impact of mild EOIS on lung function remains poorly understood, as it has historically been considered negligible, leading to limited attention in this area of research. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of mild EOIS on pulmonary function and exercise capacity.

### Anterior surgical treatment of scoliosis in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome [^8a82758b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Case Report

Patient's History

A 12-year-old girl was referred for evaluation of a left-sided thoracolumbar scoliosis of 42°. She was diagnosed with LDS on the basis of clinical findings and genetic testing. The scoliosis had been treated with a corset, which at first was worn only at night, but later, with progression of the curve, also during the day.

Documented cardiovascular findings included mild tricuspidal and mitral valve prolapse, slight dilatation of the annulus fibrosus, an aortic sinus, and a microaneurysm with a dilatation of 1.7 mm in the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery. Angiotensin-II antagonist (losartan) therapy had already been initiated to keep blood pressure levels low and decrease transforming growth factor beta signaling.

Clinical Examination

On initial examination, the patient was of tall stature and presented with a marfanoid habitus, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, joint hyperlaxity, and left-sided thoracolumbar scoliosis. The patient had a cleft palate and thin, translucent skin.

The scoliosis was measured as a 1.5-cm truncus shift to the left, with no shoulder obliquity but asymmetrical waist triangles (Figure 1). The forward-bending test showed a prominent lumbar hump on the left side at L1-2. A pelvic obliquity on the left side and a 2-cm longer right leg were also noted. Skeletal maturity was classified as Risser sign 0, indicating significant remaining potential for growth and curve progression.

Neurologic examination documented normal sensation and overall normal motor activity of the lower and upper extremities.

Radiologic Examinations

On standing AP whole-spine radiographs, two regional curves were identified: a left-sided lumbar curve (T12-L4; apex, L2) that progressed gradually from 34° to 42° during the period of 2 years, and a compensatory right-sided thoracic curve (T8-T12; apex, T10), with a Cobb angle of 19° (Figure 2, A). Supine side bending to the left side showed good flexibility of the lumbar curve, with a curve correction to almost 0° (Figure 2, B).

### Evaluation of back pain in children and adolescents [^0f651bca]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Back pain is fairly prevalent in healthy children and adolescents. When children or adolescents seek medical care for back pain, it is highly likely that underlying pathology will be identified. Common causes of back pain include nonspecific pain or muscle strain, herniated disk, spondylolysis, scoliosis, and Scheuermann's kyphosis. Less common causes include tumor, infection, and sickle cell crisis. If nonspecific back pain is suspected, treatment may include home-based exercise, physical therapy, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If the history and physical examination suggest underlying pathology, radiography, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein measurement should be performed. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or bone scanning may be needed depending on the suspected cause. It is generally accepted that the following factors warrant immediate evaluation: patient age younger than four years, persistent symptoms, self-imposed activity limitations, systemic symptoms, increasing discomfort, persistent night-time pain, and neurologic symptoms.

### A 7-year-old female with hypotonia and scoliosis [^0be1e2a5]. Brain Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Normally, on immunohistochemistry of the skeletal muscle, collagen VI is prominently observed in the sarcolemma and partly in the interstitium. In contrast, in the majority (85%) of the patients with UCMD, collagen VI was almost completely deficient from the sarcolemma, while it was present in the interstitium, known as sarcolemma‐specific collagen VI deficiency (SSCD). Additionally, a minority (15%) of patients showed complete deficiency (CD). SSCD is caused by a sporadic dominant mutation in the regions located at the N‐terminal side of the cysteine residue within the THD of either COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3, while CD is caused by a recessive mutation of any of the three COL6 genes. Although the remarkable gait acquisition, hyper relaxation of the distal joint, and arthrogryposis are consistent with UCMD, it is possible that it is an intermediate form. However, this variant has been previously reported as a UCMD form and is considered to be consistent with UCMD along with clinical manifestations. If the detected variant is in the triple helix domain, which is the hotspot of the disease, and was previously reported for collagen VI‐related myopathy, diagnosis can be made based on clinical information and genetic analysis without examining muscle pathology.

Our case was a typical case of UCMD with a reported variant in the triple‐helical domain, the major site of the disease. The assessment of a sarcolemmal collagen VI deficiency on muscle pathology can provide useful information leading to a confident diagnosis of collagen VI‐related myopathy especially when the pathogenic interpretation of the genetic variant is difficult.

### Screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^026e175d]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis — burden of disease indicates that the prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (defined as a Cobb angle ≥ 10°) ranges from 1% to 3% among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years; cumulative incidence estimates for greater severity are 1.0% (Cobb angle ≥ 20°) and 0.4% (Cobb angle ≥ 40°); prevalence varies by sex from 0.15% to 0.66% in boys and from 0.24% to 3.10% in girls; prevalence of a 10° curve is similar between sexes, but girls are 10 times more likely than boys to progress to a Cobb angle of 30° or greater and are also 5 times more likely than boys to have a Cobb angle of 20° or greater.

### Surgical correction of developmental scoliosis following cardiac transplantation: case report [^0c7ddf74]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To present a pediatric patient who underwent successful 2-stage anterior and posterior scoliosis surgery 20 months after cardiac transplantation.

Summary Of Background Data

Cardiac transplantation has increased the life expectancy in children with end-stage cardiac failure caused by congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy. Scoliosis is commonly associated with congenital cardiac disease. Previous reports have suggested that anterior scoliosis surgery is contraindicated after heart transplantation.

Methods

We describe the case of a 13-year-old patient who underwent staged anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis to correct a severe thoracic developmental scoliosis.

Results

The 2 procedures were performed 1 week apart. Following the first stage, pulmonary edema had developed, which required reintubation and administration of diuretics. Significant blood loss occurred during the posterior spinal fusion. The patient had a satisfactory correction of her scoliosis and made a good recovery. Three years after surgery, she had no complaints of her back and had a solid spinal fusion.

Conclusions

Elective anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis can be safely performed in cardiac transplant recipients with severe developmental scoliosis. This procedure can achieve optimum correction of the curvature and a successful outcome without long-term medical or technical complications.

Patient 2

A 16-year-old girl presented with recurrent abscesses over her face, scalp, and back since infancy eventuating in scarring alopecia. She was deaf and mute. Age of menarche was 17 (a year after initial presentation). Menses were irregular from the beginning, and she has had amenorrhea for the last 2 years. She had history of recurrent blepharitis bilaterally, and the vision in her right eye deteriorated gradually from keratitis, neovascularization, and finally to corneal opacity (Fig 2, A). On examination, there were hyperkeratotic impetiginized plaques and nodules with scarring over the axillae and face. Axillary and pubic hairs were almost absent, and breasts were hypoplastic (Fig 2, B). She had mild thoracolumbar scoliosis. She was 152 cm tall and weighed only 36 kg.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with Marfan syndrome [^e80793cf]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Marfan syndrome — pulmonary complications and testing guidance — Emphysema occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of those with "classic" Marfan syndrome, and lung bullae develop in 4% to 15% of patients, which can predispose to spontaneous pneumothorax with symptoms including sudden chest pain, dyspnea, and/or cyanosis. Breathing against resistance, scuba diving, or high-altitude sports should be avoided, and recurrent pneumothorax may require chemical or surgical pleurodesis or surgical resection of pulmonary blebs. A restrictive lung disease pattern is typical, and pulmonary function tests should be performed in any patient with pulmonary complaints or significant pectus deformity or scoliosis and can be monitored after surgical repair.

### Respiratory care of the patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: ATS consensus statement [^f21f74b2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Scoliosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy — epidemiology and surgical thresholds are specified. Nearly all patients with DMD develop scoliosis after losing independent ambulation, beginning in the second decade of life, and surgery is usually scheduled once the Cobb angle measured on scoliosis films is between 30 and 50 degrees. There are no absolute contraindications for surgery based on pulmonary function; some report good results even in patients whose FVC is 20% of predicted.

A year after anterolateral spondylodesis for progressive scoliosis, the patient showed a flexion gait pattern with recurrent deformity, due to late infection. Surgical debridement resolved all symptoms. Whereas most postoperative infections occur after posterior spondylodesis and present with back pain and mild increase of infection parameters, late infection after anterolateral approach is rare. In this case the patient did not present with the classic symptoms.

### How common is back pain and what biopsychosocial factors are associated with back pain in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? [^82174f10]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spine deformity in adolescent patients. Although structural deformity may affect spinal biomechanics of patients with AIS, little is known regarding various period prevalence proportions of back pain and chronic back pain and factors associated with back pain in such patients.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the period prevalence rates of back pain among teenagers with AIS? (2) Is back pain in patients with AIS associated with curve severity?

Methods

A total of 987 patients with AIS who were treated without surgery were recruited from a single center's scoliosis clinic. Between December 2016 and July 2017, this center treated 1116 patients with suspected AIS. During that time, patients were offered surgery when their Cobb angle was at least 50° and had evidence of curve progression between two visits, and most of the patients who were offered surgery underwent it; other patients with AIS were managed nonsurgically with regular observation, brace prescription, posture training, and reassurance. To be included in this prospective, cross-sectional study, a patient needed to be aged between 10 and 18 years with a Cobb angle > 10°. No followup data were required. A total of 1097 patients with AIS were managed nonsurgically (98.3% of the group seen during the period in question). After obtaining parental consent, patients provided data related to their demographics; physical activity levels; lifetime, 12-month, 30-day, 7-day, and current thoracic pain and low back pain (LBP); chronic back pain (thoracic pain/LBP); brace use; and treatments for scoliosis/back pain. Pain was rated on a 10-point numeric rating scale for pain. The Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales were also assessed. These features and radiologic study parameters between patients with and without back pain were also compared. Factors associated with current and 12-month back pain as well as chronic back pain were analyzed by multivariate analyses.

Results

Depending on the types of period prevalence, the prevalence of thoracic pain ranged from 6% (55 of 987) within 12 months to 14% (139 of 987) within 7 days, whereas that of LBP ranged from 6% (54 of 987) to 29% (289 of 987). Specifically, chronic thoracic pain or LBP had the lowest prevalence. Compared with the no pain group, patients with current back pain had more severe insomnia (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–2.93) and daytime sleepiness (OR, 2.41; p < 0.001, 95% CI, 1.43–4.07). Those with chronic back pain had the same problems along with moderate depression (OR, 2.49; p = 0.03; 95% CI, 1.08–5.71). Older age (OR range, 1.17–1.42; all p values ≤ 0.030) and Cobb angle > 40° (OR range, 2.38–3.74; all p values ≤ 0.015), daytime sleepiness (OR range, 2.39–2.41; all p values ≤ 0.011), and insomnia (OR range, 1.76–2.31; all p values ≤ 0.001) were associated with episodic and/or chronic back pain. Females were more likely to experience back pain in the last 12 months than males. Moderate depression (OR, 3.29; 1.45–7.47; p = 0.004) and wearing a brace (OR, 3.00; 1.47–6.15; p = 0.003) were independently associated with chronic back pain.

Conclusions

Biopsychosocial factors are associated with the presence and severity of back pain in the AIS population. Our results highlight the importance of considering back pain screening/management for patients with AIS with their psychosocial profile in addition to curve magnitude monitoring. In particular, sleep quality should be routinely assessed. Longitudinal changes and effects of psychotherapy should be determined in future studies.

### Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in siblings treated by surgical deformity correction [^68696221]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Report

This case report followed the Consensus-based Clinical Case Reporting Guideline Development guidelines. Consent for publication was obtained from both patients and parents. A 15-year-old adolescent girl visited our clinic with back pain after recognition of the incidental findings of a scoliotic curve in the spine. Physical examination was notable for 5 cm of thoracic hump without any neurological deficits (Figure 1, A and B). Whole spine radiographs detected Lenke classification type 3CN with 60.3° of the main thoracic curve and 56.3° of the thoracolumbar/lumbar curve (Figure 1, C–F). The patient underwent deformity correction with posterior instrumented fusion from T4 to L3 with thoracoplasty of the right 7th to 10th rib (Figure 1, G and H).

A 15-year-old adolescent girl visited our clinic with the incidental findings of a scoliotic curve in the spine with 5 cm of thoracic hump without any neurological deficits (A and B). Whole spine radiographs detected Lenke classification type IIIBN with 60.3° of the main thoracic curve and 56.3° of the thoracolumbar/lumbar curve (C – F). The patients underwent deformity correction with posterior instrumented fusion from T4 to L3 with thoracoplasty of the right 7th to 10th rib (G and H). AIS = adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

Four years later, her 16-year-old brother also visited our clinic with back pain after recognition of the incidental findings of a scoliotic curve in the spine. Physical examination was notable for 6 cm of thoracic hump without any neurological deficits (Figure 2, A and B). Whole spine radiographs detected Lenke classification type 2AN with 60.7° of the main thoracic curve and 32° of the proximal thoracic curve (Figure 2, C and D). The patient underwent deformity correction with posterior instrumented fusion from T5 to L2 with thoracoplasty of the right 8th to 10th rib (Figure 2, E and F).

### Screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1c0a8974]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis — Adult health outcomes by adolescent curvature severity and treatment show that the USPSTF found no studies that directly addressed whether changes in the severity of spinal curvature in adolescence result in changes in adult health outcomes and no studies that reported health outcomes stratified by degree of spinal curvature at skeletal maturity. A fair-quality retrospective observational long-term follow-up analyses (n = 339) of adults diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis in adolescence reported that quality of life, as measured by the Scoliosis Research Society 22 (SRS-22) Patient Questionnaire or the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, was not significantly different between observed and treated participants at follow-up in adulthood; adult outcomes were stratified by the type of treatment received in adolescence (bracing or surgery), with no significant differences between braced and surgically treated participants in the Oswestry Disability Index or in general well-being, self-esteem, and social activity, and pulmonary and pregnancy outcomes were also not significantly different, but braced participants rated their body appearance as more distorted and reported more negative treatment experiences than those treated with surgery.
