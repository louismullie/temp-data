## Question

Loperamide

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about loperamide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and pharmacology. Then, I should verify labeled indications and dosing. Next, I will review efficacy across conditions, followed by safety, contraindications, and special populations. After that, I need to examine misuse, abuse, and cardiotoxicity. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and provide a practical, risk–benefit conclusion with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the basics: loperamide is a synthetic piperidine derivative and a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor agonist that slows intestinal transit without clinically meaningful CNS penetration at therapeutic doses, which underpins its OTC status and antidiarrheal use [^112YbiXV] [^111FKaix].

> I need to check the labeled indications and dosing carefully. The FDA indicates loperamide for control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea in patients 2 years and older, for chronic diarrhea in adults associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and for reducing ileostomy discharge; typical adult dosing is 4 mg initially, then 2 mg after each unformed stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day prescription or 8 mg/day OTC, with pediatric weight-based dosing for ages 2–12 years and a strict contraindication under 2 years due to respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions [^111n7Fva] [^114Y4oya] [^113S8Gnj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy in all settings. For acute infectious diarrhea, loperamide reduces stool frequency and duration in adults, including travelers' diarrhea, and combining with antibiotics can shorten illness; however, it should be avoided in dysentery or when toxic megacolon is a risk, and it is not recommended for children under 18 with acute infectious diarrhea due to safety concerns, so I should confirm etiology before use [^111Qhugr] [^114fuMUB] [^112acgxv] [^1112EXvo].

> Next, I should review IBS-D. Guidelines diverge: the AGA suggests loperamide as a conditional option for diarrhea control despite very low certainty evidence, noting no benefit for global IBS symptoms or pain; the BSG supports it as first-line for diarrhea; the CAG advises avoiding continuous loperamide; and ACG guidance notes it improves stool frequency and consistency but not pain, so expectations should be framed around stool form and urgency rather than global symptom relief [^112WsWqD] [^113KVzym] [^114WV7B8] [^115SGHfw] [^115KpYq5].

> I will now examine fecal incontinence. Wait, let me verify the randomized data: a large factorial trial showed no superiority of loperamide over placebo for improving Vaizey scores at 24 weeks, whereas a crossover study found loperamide and psyllium similarly effective with more constipation on loperamide; thus, loperamide may help some patients symptomatically, but evidence for durable benefit is limited and constipation is common [^11398ZMd] [^116pyemD].

> Let me consider short bowel syndrome. In SBS, loperamide is commonly used and often requires higher, scheduled doses up to 32 mg/day, given 30 minutes before meals, with potential synergy when combined with codeine; this is a niche where careful titration to stool output is essential and accepted practice despite limited high-quality trials [^1161FmW3].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability at therapeutic doses. Common adverse effects include constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, and dizziness; rare events include paralytic ileus, toxic megacolon, and hypersensitivity; importantly, there is no dose adjustment required in renal impairment, but hepatic impairment warrants caution due to increased exposure and risk of CNS toxicity, so I need to ensure I screen liver disease and monitor for sedation or confusion if hepatic function is impaired [^114VRmhj] [^111BioKA] [^11642hc8] [^112fg4Ss] [^114duBJa] [^112cbuYD].

> But wait, what if the patient is using high doses. I need to ensure I address misuse and cardiotoxicity. At supratherapeutic doses, loperamide can cross the BBB and cause CNS opioid effects and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including QT prolongation, torsades, QRS widening, and ventricular tachycardia; case series and regulatory warnings document deaths and severe rhythm disturbances with doses often exceeding 100–200 mg/day, and naloxone can reverse opioid effects but not cardiotoxicity, which requires supportive care and monitoring [^115CnT2e] [^111DMQ1R] [^1112vYwc] [^113hW4ey] [^116CvA34].

> I should confirm pediatric nuances. Under 2 years is contraindicated due to respiratory depression and serious cardiac events; for ages 2–12 years, weight-based dosing is recommended with close monitoring for dehydration and variability in response; in children with HIV or cryptosporidiosis, antimotility agents should be used with caution, reinforcing that loperamide is not first-line in pediatric infectious diarrhea and should be reserved for select scenarios with careful supervision [^114Y4oya] [^113svpRr] [^114v8WfZ] [^111KjobC].

> Let me reconsider special contexts. In pregnancy and lactation, loperamide is generally considered compatible when needed, including for travelers' diarrhea in breastfeeding mothers, though rehydration remains foundational; in older adults, I should avoid QT-prolonging co-medications and monitor for CNS effects given susceptibility to arrhythmias and sedation [^115TF7R3] [^11642hc8].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to synthesize. For acute watery diarrhea in immunocompetent adults, loperamide is reasonable adjunctive therapy once hydration is addressed; for IBS-D, it can reduce diarrhea but not pain, so it is best for stool-form–predominant complaints; for fecal incontinence, evidence is mixed and constipation may limit use; for SBS, it is a core agent when titrated to output; across all uses, avoid in dysentery, suspected toxic megacolon, or when fever and blood are present [^111Qhugr] [^112WsWqD] [^114WV7B8] [^1161FmW3] [^114fuMUB].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical counseling and monitoring. Advise patients to stay within labeled maxima, stop if constipation, distension, or ileus symptoms occur, and seek care if there is no improvement in 48 hours, fever, blood in stool, or palpitations; in patients with risk factors for misuse or on interacting drugs, screen for high-dose use and counsel on cardiotoxic risks; in hepatic impairment, start low and go slow with vigilance for CNS effects; and in pediatrics, use weight-based dosing and avoid under 2 years entirely [^114Y4oya] [^113svpRr] [^11642hc8] [^1111Bo1U].

Loperamide is a **peripheral mu-opioid agonist** [^112YbiXV] for acute and chronic diarrhea, including IBS-D [^112WsWqD] and traveler's diarrhea [^116wLYA8], with onset in 1–2 hours and duration up to 16 hours. It is **contraindicated in children under 2 years** [^114Y4oya] due to risk of respiratory depression and serious cardiac events, and should be avoided in dysentery or when toxic megacolon is a risk [^114fuMUB]. At therapeutic doses, adverse effects are usually mild (constipation, nausea, abdominal cramps) [^114VRmhj]; however, high-dose misuse can cause life-threatening cardiotoxicity (QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmias) [^115CnT2e] [^1112vYwc]. No dose adjustment is needed in renal impairment [^112fg4Ss], but hepatic impairment requires caution [^112cbuYD]. Loperamide is not a controlled substance [^115HDxeY], but abuse is increasing; clinicians should counsel on safe use and monitor for misuse [^1145WPg2].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Peripheral mu-opioid receptor agonist that slows intestinal transit, increasing water and electrolyte absorption [^112YbiXV].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Poor oral bioavailability (< 2%) [^111FKaix] due to first-pass metabolism and P-glycoprotein efflux; minimal CNS penetration at therapeutic doses [^115HDxeY].

- **Onset and duration**: Onset within 1–2 hours; duration up to 16 hours.

---

## Clinical indications

Loperamide is indicated for:

| **Indication** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|
| Acute nonspecific diarrhea | Adults and children ≥ 2 years [^111n7Fva] |
| Chronic diarrhea | Adults with inflammatory bowel disease [^111n7Fva] |
| Traveler's diarrhea | Moderate cases [^116wLYA8] |
| Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) | Symptom control (conditional recommendation) [^112WsWqD] [^114WV7B8] |
| Fecal incontinence | Adjunctive therapy [^116pyemD] |

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Adults**: Initial 4 mg, then 2 mg after each unformed stool; maximum 16 mg/day (prescription) or 8 mg/day (OTC) [^114Y4oya].

- **Children 2–12 years**: Weight-based dosing; maximum 8 mg/day [^114Y4oya].

- **Children < 2 years**: Contraindicated due to risk of respiratory depression and serious cardiac events [^114Y4oya] [^1111Bo1U].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Constipation, nausea, abdominal cramps, dizziness [^114VRmhj].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, severe constipation, and hypersensitivity reactions (rare) [^111BioKA].

- **Cardiotoxicity**: High-dose misuse can cause QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias, and death [^115CnT2e] [^1112vYwc].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **children < 2 years** [^114Y4oya], hypersensitivity to loperamide, and conditions where inhibition of peristalsis is dangerous (e.g. toxic megacolon, severe colitis) [^113svpRr]. Use with caution in hepatic impairment [^112cbuYD], patients with QT risk factors, and when coadministered with CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors [^115HDxeY].

---

## Special populations

In hepatic impairment, **use with caution** due to increased systemic exposure [^112cbuYD]; no dose adjustment is required in renal impairment [^112fg4Ss]. In pregnancy and lactation, use only if clearly needed; minimal systemic absorption suggests low risk, but data are limited.

---

## Abuse and misuse

Loperamide is not a controlled substance [^115HDxeY], but misuse at high doses (50–400 mg/day) can produce euphoria and central opioid effects, with significant cardiotoxicity risk [^111DMQ1R] [^1112vYwc]. Reports of misuse and cardiotoxicity have increased, prompting FDA warnings and clinician vigilance [^1145WPg2] [^1111Bo1U].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **IBS-D**: Consider loperamide for diarrhea control; limited benefit for abdominal pain [^112WsWqD] [^114WV7B8].

- **Traveler's diarrhea**: Loperamide monotherapy is reasonable for moderate cases [^116wLYA8].

- **Infectious diarrhea**: Use only in immunocompetent adults with noninflammatory diarrhea; avoid in dysentery or with fever [^114fuMUB].

---

Loperamide is effective for diarrhea control across multiple settings, but clinicians must **weigh benefits against risks**, especially in children, patients with hepatic impairment, and those at risk of misuse.

Who: This position statement is a collaborative effort by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) and the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) and has been endorsed by the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT). The position statement describes loperamide misuse, proposed mechanisms of toxicity, adverse clinical effects, and recommendations for the acute monitoring and management of patients with loperamide toxicity. Why: Use of high-dose loperamide for its euphoric effects and to self-treat opioid use disorder (in place of evidence-based therapies, like buprenorphine or methadone), is increasing. Despite reports in the medical literature and lay press, many remain unaware of high-dose loperamide use and how to manage patients with loperamide-associated toxicities.

### Racecadotril in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a systematic, comprehensive review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112DvxC5]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

While loperamide is a standard treatment for mitigating symptoms in adults with acute diarrhea, its use in children is excluded in those aged less than 24 months and recent guidelines more generally recommend not to use loperamide in children. Of note, most racecadotril studies in acute diarrhea have included children of less than 24 months (Table 1). Our search has identified only one study comparing racecadotril with loperamide in children with acute diarrhea. That trial found loperamide and racecadotril to be equally effective for the primary endpoint, number of diarrheic stools until recovery, and for secondary endpoints, but significantly more children in the loperamide group required concomitant medications to reach this goal. While it may be argued that loperamide may have been under-dosed in that study (0.03 mg/kg as compared to regular dose of 0.04 mg/kg), the loperamide dose was sufficient to cause a considerable incidence of AEs. Moreover, the finding of comparable efficacy of loperamide and racecadotril is in line with many direct comparative trials in adults. Thus, in contrast to loperamide, there is a solid database supporting the use of racecadotril in children of all ages including those aged less than 24 months. In an age group where both treatments can be used, they exhibit similarly efficacy, as they did in many studies in adults.

AGA irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) — loperamide recommendation and evidence: The AGA suggests using loperamide in patients IBS-D-. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty). No new studies have evaluated the efficacy of loperamide in the management of patients with IBS, and evidence comes from two small, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; there was a lack of beneficial effect on global improvement of symptoms of IBS and urgency, with no improvement in urgency and no data on IBS-QOL or adverse events. Loperamide is FDA-approved for the treatment of diarrhea, and the optimal dose and method of using loperamide is not known and can vary between patients based on symptom patterns.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^112vMm7m]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Eluxadoline is a peripherally active, mixed μ-OR and κ-OR agonist and δ-OR antagonist with low systemic absorption and low oral bioavailability that is approved for the treatment of adults with IBS-D in the United States. The mixed pharmacological profile of eluxadoline may mitigate the risk of constipation effects through unopposed μ-OR agonism as seen with agents such as loperamide, through antagonism of the δ-OR. The efficacy of eluxadoline was demonstrated in two large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials in patients with IBS-D. Eluxadoline met the primary efficacy composite end point in these trials, demonstrating simultaneous relief of the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea associated with IBS-D. In contrast, loperamide has not been demonstrated to relieve abdominal pain in previous clinical studies. In the phase 3 studies reported by Lembo et al. prior use of loperamide and its adequacy in controlling IBS-D symptoms were captured at baseline. This presented the opportunity to determine the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients previously treated with loperamide. It was hypothesized that eluxadoline could provide effective relief of IBS symptoms in patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide.

The primary aim of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D who reported that they did not experience adequate symptom relief with prior loperamide therapy. This prespecified prospective subgroup analysis evaluated the composite end point response rates in the pooled data from two phase 3 studies of patients who had previously experienced adequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide in the year before randomization, and patients who had not experienced adequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. A secondary aim of this analysis was to evaluate loperamide rescue medication use across all treatment arms of the phase 3 studies and its impact on efficacy results.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^1124CM5k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

IBS-3001 and IBS-3002 were parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter phase 3 studies in adult patients with IBS-D. The studies comprised a pretreatment period followed by 52 (IBS-3001) or 26 (IBS-3002) weeks of treatment, during which patients were randomized to receive eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg, or placebo, twice daily. Patients underwent a 2-week posttreatment follow-up period in IBS-3001, or a 4-week single-blind placebo withdrawal in IBS-3002. Patients were included in the studies if they were 18–80 years of age, with a diagnosis of IBS-D (Rome III Criteria), and with an average worst abdominal pain score of > 3.0, an average Bristol Stool Scale score for stool consistency of ≥ 5.5 (on a scale of 1 (hard stool) to 7 (watery diarrhea)) and ≥ 5 days with a Bristol Stool Scale score of ≥ 5, and an average IBS-D global symptom score of ≥ 2.0 (scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms)). Patients were also required to not have used any loperamide rescue medication within 14 days before randomization. Patients with current or expected use of opioid-containing agents (e.g. antidiarrheals or opioid analgesics) were excluded.

Primary efficacy end point

The primary efficacy end point of both studies was the proportion of patients who had a composite response on ≥ 50% of days, comprising a simultaneous improvement in abdominal pain and a reduction in diarrhea, evaluated over the initial 12 weeks of double-blind treatment (FDA end point) and over 26 weeks of treatment (European Medicines Agency end point).

CONTRAINDICATIONS

IMODIUM is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to loperamide hydrochloride or to any of the excipients.

IMODIUM is contraindicated in patients with abdominal pain in the absence of diarrhea.

IMODIUM is not recommended in infants below 24 months of age.

IMODIUM should not be used as the primary therapy:

in patients with acute dysentery, which is characterized by blood in stools and high fever,
in patients with acute ulcerative colitis,
in patients with bacterial enterocolitis caused by invasive organisms including Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter,
in patients with pseudomembranous colitis associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^117Pxs9G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives:

Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is often managed with over-the-counter therapies such as loperamide, though with limited success. This analysis evaluated the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients previously treated with loperamide in two phase 3 studies.

Methods:

Adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were enrolled and randomized to placebo or eluxadoline (75 or 100 mg) twice daily for 26 (IBS-3002) or 52 (IBS-3001) weeks. Patients reported loperamide use over the previous year and recorded their rescue loperamide use during the studies. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with a composite response of simultaneous improvement in abdominal pain and reduction in diarrhea.

Results:

A total of 2,428 patients were enrolled; 36.0% reported prior loperamide use, of whom 61.8% reported prior inadequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. Among patients with prior loperamide use, a greater proportion treated with eluxadoline (75 and 100 mg) were composite responders vs. those treated with placebo with inadequate prior symptom control, over weeks 1–12 (26.3% (P = 0.001) and 27.0% (P < 0.001) vs. 12.7%, respectively); similar results were observed over weeks 1–26. When daily rescue loperamide use was imputed as a nonresponse day, the composite responder rate was still higher in patients receiving eluxadoline (75 and 100 mg) vs. placebo over weeks 1–12 (P < 0.001) and weeks 1–26 (P < 0.001). Adverse events included nausea and abdominal pain.

Conclusions:

Eluxadoline effectively and safely treats IBS-D symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients who self-report either adequate or inadequate control of their symptoms with prior loperamide treatment, with comparable efficacy and safety irrespective of the use of loperamide as a rescue medication during eluxadoline treatment.

### Controlling faecal incontinence in women by performing anal exercises with biofeedback or loperamide: a randomised clinical trial [^11398ZMd]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Well designed, large comparative effectiveness trials assessing the efficacy of primary interventions for faecal incontinence are few in number. The objectives of this study were to compare different combinations of anorectal manometry-assisted biofeedback, loperamide, education, and oral placebo.

Methods

In this randomised factorial trial, participants were recruited from eight clinical sites in the USA. Women with at least one episode of faecal incontinence per month in the past 3 months were randomly assigned 0.5:1:1:1 to one of four groups: oral placebo plus education only, placebo plus anorectal manometry-assisted biofeedback, loperamide plus education only, and loperamide plus anorectal manometry-assisted biofeedback. Participants received 2 mg per day of loperamide or oral placebo with the option of dose escalation or reduction. Women assigned to biofeedback received six visits, including strength and sensory biofeedback training. All participants received a standardised faecal incontinence patient education pamphlet and were followed for 24 weeks after starting treatment. The primary endpoint was change in St Mark's (Vaizey) faecal incontinence severity score between baseline and 24 weeks, analysed by intention-to-treat using general linear mixed modelling. Investigators, interviewers, and outcome evaluators were masked to biofeedback assignment. Participants and all study staff other than the research pharmacist were masked to medication assignment. Randomisation took place within the electronic data capture system, was stratified by site using randomly permuted blocks (block size 7), and the sizes of the blocks and the allocation sequence were known only to the data coordinating centre. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02008565.

Findings

Between April 1, 2014, and Sept 30, 2015, 377 women were enrolled, of whom 300 were randomly assigned to placebo plus education (n = 42), placebo plus biofeedback (n = 84), loperamide plus education (n = 88), and the combined intervention of loperamide plus biofeedback (n = 86). At 24 weeks, there were no differences between loperamide versus placebo (model estimated score change -1.5 points, 95% CI -3.4 to 0.4, p = 0.12), biofeedback versus education (-0.7 points, -2.6 to 1.2, p = 0.47), and loperamide and biofeedback versus placebo and biofeedback (-1.9 points, -4.1 to 0.3, p = 0.092) or versus loperamide plus education (-1.1 points, -3.4 to 1.1, p = 0.33). Constipation was the most common grade 3 or higher adverse event and was reported by two (2%) of 86 participants in the loperamide and biofeedback group and two (2%) of 88 in the loperamide plus education group. The percentage of participants with any serious adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups. Only one serious adverse event was considered related to treatment (small bowel obstruction in the placebo and biofeedback group).

Interpretation

In women with normal stool consistency and faecal incontinence bothersome enough to seek treatment, we were unable to find evidence against the null hypotheses that loperamide is equivalent to placebo, that anal exercises with biofeedback is equivalent to an educational pamphlet, and that loperamide and biofeedback are equivalent to oral placebo and biofeedback or loperamide plus an educational pamphlet. Because these are common first-line treatments for faecal incontinence, clinicians could consider combining loperamide, anal manometry-assisted biofeedback, and a standard educational pamphlet, but this is likely to result in only negligible improvement over individual therapies and patients should be counselled regarding possible constipation.

### Loperamide abuse and dependence: clinical features and treatment considerations [^115Uz7E6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder and its associated mortality have become national epidemic problems. Different measures and regulations have been implemented to curb this trend, including stricter opioid prescribing practice. With the decreased access to prescription opioids, individuals with opioid use disorder have explored alternatives including loperamide, a peripheral opioid mu-receptor agonist. There are reports of increased loperamide misuse, dependence, and mortality rate in the past few years from poison control centers, medical examiners' offices, and clinical settings. Here, we report a case of loperamide use disorder, which led to the death of the patient. Associated clinical features and treatment of loperamide use disorder, including management of intoxication and withdrawal, and long-term maintenance therapy are discussed along with potential prescribing and sale regulations to manage this newly emerging substance use disorder.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111Qhugr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^115xkGAC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety findings with eluxadoline in patients who reported inadequate symptom control with loperamide were consistent with the findings from the overall phase 3 patient population and the known safety profile of eluxadoline (B.D. Cash et al. unpublished data); over half of patients with inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide experienced AEs with eluxadoline, of which GI AEs (nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation) were the most frequent, although overall incidences were low. Of the patients who used rescue loperamide during the studies and reported GI AEs, over half reported ≥ 1 GI AE with an onset date after loperamide use. However, there was no clear temporal relationship between loperamide use and the occurrence of GI AEs. Constipation was more frequently reported in patients treated with eluxadoline compared with placebo, though the incidence was low and consistent with that from the overall phase 3 patient population (B.D. Cash et al. unpublished data).

The primary end point of these two large, prospective trials focused on efficacy and safety. Although data collection for the trials was prospective, the present study represents a subgroup of the initial study, with the inherent limitations of such an analysis. That said, the large sample size and the prospective nature of the analyses minimizes these limitations. Furthermore, although many of the study patients had used loperamide during the year before study initiation, over half of the patients had not, and past use of loperamide relied upon patient recollection that may be unreliable and cannot be confirmed. Indeed, the exact dose of loperamide used by patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide remains unknown; therefore, a comparison of patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide at one dose compared with another dose is not possible.

### Loperamide abuse cardiotoxicity. should loperamide still be an over the counter medication? [^112k81KB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that is inexpensive, easily accessible, and widely used. It is generally thought to be safe and effective without the potential for abuse. However, recent discovery of its ability to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms at high doses has led to not only its abuse, but also the need to recognize its cardiotoxicity due to the ability to prolong the QTc interval. We report a case of a 33 year old female with a history of opioid dependence who presented to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath and generalized weakness who was subsequently found to be in ventricular tachycardia. Electrocardiogram showed prolongation of the QTc and the patient later admitted to ingestion of 70 loperamide pills daily for the past year in order to alleviate her opioid withdrawal symptoms. Due to increased loperamide abuse and toxicity displayed within the last several years, public and health provider awareness should be optimized to fully understand its lethality, and stricter regulations on its availability to the general population should be considered. Even in asymptomatic patients with ECG abnormalities, emergency medicine physicians should admit them for further monitoring and aggressive medical therapy.

### Clinical review: loperamide toxicity [^113hW4ey]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is a nonprescription opioid widely used for the treatment of diarrhea. Although it is relatively safe at therapeutic doses, increasing reports describe its misuse and abuse at very high doses either for euphoric effects or to attenuate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Life-threatening loperamide toxicity can result from the relatively new clinical syndrome of loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity. These patients are often young and may present in cardiac arrest or with unheralded, recurrent syncope in conjunction with ECG abnormalities, including marked QT-interval prolongation, QRS-interval widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias. Features of conventional opioid toxicity may also be present. The mainstays of treatment include advanced cardiac life support and supportive care, although selected patients may be candidates for overdrive pacing, intravenous lipid emulsion, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In patients who survive loperamide toxicity, consideration should be given to the treatment of an underlying opioid use disorder, if present.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^114WV7B8]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for irritable bowel syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of diarrhea, loperamide, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering loperamide as first-line therapy for diarrhea in patients with IBS. Recognize that abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and constipation are common, and may limit tolerability. Titrate the dose carefully to avoid this.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^116c2WcD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is often managed with over-the-counter therapies such as loperamide, though with limited success. This analysis evaluated the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients previously treated with loperamide in two phase 3 studies.

Methods

Adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were enrolled and randomized to placebo or eluxadoline (75 or 100mg) twice daily for 26 (IBS-3002) or 52 (IBS-3001) weeks. Patients reported loperamide use over the previous year and recorded their rescue loperamide use during the studies. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with a composite response of simultaneous improvement in abdominal pain and reduction in diarrhea.

Results

A total of 2,428 patients were enrolled; 36.0% reported prior loperamide use, of whom 61.8% reported prior inadequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. Among patients with prior loperamide use, a greater proportion treated with eluxadoline (75 and 100mg) were composite responders vs. those treated with placebo with inadequate prior symptom control, over weeks 1–12 (26.3% (P = 0.001) and 27.0% (P < 0.001) vs. 12.7%, respectively); similar results were observed over weeks 1–26. When daily rescue loperamide use was imputed as a nonresponse day, the composite responder rate was still higher in patients receiving eluxadoline (75 and 100mg) vs. placebo over weeks 1–12 (P < 0.001) and weeks 1–26 (P < 0.001). Adverse events included nausea and abdominal pain.

Conclusions

Eluxadoline effectively and safely treats IBS-D symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients who self-report either adequate or inadequate control of their symptoms with prior loperamide treatment, with comparable efficacy and safety irrespective of the use of loperamide as a rescue medication during eluxadoline treatment.

### Management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: a review of nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions [^115KpYq5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Loperamide and diphenoxylate/atropine

ACG guidelines currently recommend against the use of the antidiarrheal agent loperamide for overall symptom improvement in patients with IBS. Loperamide was no more effective than placebo in a pooled analysis of two RCTs (n = 42; RR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1–1.4). In one study by Cann and colleagues, not included in the aforementioned pooled analysis, loperamide improved daily stool frequency compared with placebo after 5 weeks of treatment (1.3 versus 1.9 stools/day, respectively); however, loperamide did not improve the number of days per week that patients experienced abdominal pain compared with placebo (3.5 versus 3.4 days). Additionally, in a randomized, double-blind study of patients with acute nonspecific diarrhea (n = 493), a 2-day treatment with loperamide 2 mg alone (maximum daily dose, 8 mg) was not as effective as the combination of loperamide 2 mg and simethicone 125 mg for the relief of gas-related symptoms (e.g. pain and bloating); the median time to complete relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort was 42 h with loperamide alone and 12 h with loperamide and simethicone combined versus 48 h with placebo (p < 0.001, for loperamide and simethicone combined versus other groups). Similarly, in a subsequent randomized, double-blind study of patients with acute diarrhea (n = 483), the median time to complete relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort (e.g. pain and bloating) was significantly shorter with a 2-day treatment of loperamide 2 mg and simethicone 125 mg combination compared with loperamide 2 mg alone (maximum daily dose, 8 mg) or placebo (12 versus 24 and 23.5 h, respectively; p = 0.0001, for both comparisons). In a randomized, double-blind study of patients with IBS (n = 69), treatment with loperamide 2 mg once daily (adjusted as needed to 4 mg/day for 5 days, and up to 6 mg/day for the next 4 days) did not improve abdominal pain from baseline, or compared with placebo, after 5 weeks. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study (n = 30) that included patients with IBS-D (n = 21), the antidiarrheal agent diphenoxylate 5 mg/atropine sulfate 0.025 mg was associated with a significantly smaller percentage of solid stools compared with loperamide 2 mg or codeine 45 mg after 4 weeks of treatment (36.3% versus 67.8% and 58.4%, respectively; p < 0.01 for diphenoxylate versus loperamide and versus codeine). Further, diphenoxylate treatment was associated with significantly more AEs than loperamide treatment (p < 0.05), including central effects (i.e. depression, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea/vomiting; p < 0.01). In summary, although commonly used in clinical practice, loperamide is not effective at treating two of the most bothersome symptoms of IBS-D, namely abdominal pain and bloating. Other agents that improve multiple symptoms of IBS are preferable.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^1145dniz]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Patients on low-dose prescription opioids (< 20 mg oral morphine equivalents) and/or for a short duration (< 2–3 weeks) can generally discontinue without tapering. In other patients, tapering is advised. More rapid tapering generally results in more severe withdrawal and lower success rates. The advised rate of discontinuation in guidelines ranges between 10% per month and 50% per week of the initial dose, with slower tapers (i.e. 10% reduction per month) being more likely to be better tolerated. If rapid discontinuation of opioids is necessary for medical reasons, reduction strategies of up to 50% per week are possible. Switching to long-acting opioids (usually 70% dose-equivalent) can be considered with high doses (> 90 mg morphine equivalents) and/or prolonged opioid use (> 3 months), but also in patients with prior failed discontinuation attempts. Long-acting opioids should be tapered to the lowest possible dose, and then discontinued.

Dose reduction

Discontinuation should be the primary goal in patients using opioids for analgesic purposes. Nevertheless, in patients at high risk of relapse (high opioid doses, long-time use, either with or without opioid use disorder), long-acting opioid agonist treatment (e.g. methadone or buprenorphine) can be considered. In patients on agonist treatment, dose reduction strategies are recommended when adverse events develop, or in the event of pharmacokinetic changes, e.g. due to co-medication, successful treatment of hepatitis, or ageing.

Discontinuation interventions

Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with opioid use disorder result in lower perceived pain and focus on analgesics. Such strategies may facilitate discontinuation of opioids, although evidence is lacking. There is limited evidence for clonidine for agitation, shaking and muscle ache, anti-emetics for nausea, and loperamide for diarrhea. For insomnia, benzodiazepines should be given with caution in this patient group, due to their risk of developing sedative use disorder.

### Treatment of travelers' diarrhea: randomized trial comparing rifaximin, rifaximin plus loperamide, and loperamide alone [^1112EXvo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Antimotility agents provide rapid temporary relief of acute diarrhea, whereas antibiotics slowly cure the illness. Thus, the combination of an antimotility agent and an antibiotic may provide greater therapeutic benefit than either drug alone. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rifaximin-loperamide in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Methods

Consenting adults with acute diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours with ≥ 1 symptom of enteric infection) were randomized to receive rifaximin 200 mg 3 times daily for 3 days; loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool; or a combination of both drugs using the same dosing regimen. The primary end point was the median time from beginning therapy until passing the last unformed stool.

Results

A total of 310 patients completed treatment with rifaximin (n = 102), loperamide (n = 104), or rifaximin-loperamide combination therapy (n = 104). The groups showed demographic similarity. Rifaximin and rifaximin-loperamide significantly reduced the median time until passage of the last unformed stool (32.5 ± 4.14 h and 27.3 ± 4.13 h, respectively) vs loperamide (69 ± 4.11 h; P = 0.0019). The mean number of unformed stools passed during illness was lower with rifaximin-loperamide (3.99 ± 4.28) compared with rifaximin (6.23 ± 6.90; P = 0.004) or loperamide alone (6.72 ± 6.93; P = 0.002). All treatments were well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events.

Conclusions

Rifaximin-loperamide therapy provided rapid symptomatic improvement and greater overall wellness compared with either agent alone.

### Morphine versus loperamide with intrasite gel in the treatment of painful dermal ulcers: a randomized, crossover study [^1161KZgP]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical morphine along with intrasite gel has been proven to be a simple and effective method to relieve pain. However, morphine is still not freely available in developing countries due to drug restrictions and stringent laws governing it. Loperamide has been reported to relieve pain caused by stomatitis effectively when given topically. Loperamide, being an mu receptor agonist with no systemic absorption, can serve a dual purpose here. Also loperamide being freely available as an over-the-counter drug can be a surrogate drug for topical application.

Objectives

The primary aim was to compare the efficacy of loperamide and morphine in treating pain when applied topically along with intrasite gel.

Study Design

Adult patients with healthy wounds with pain on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) greater than 5 with no systemic comorbid illness were divided randomly into 2 groups - group morphine or group loperamide - for 24 hours followed by a 1-day washout and crossover in the other group for 24 hours. Pain was assessed once every day.

Setting

Medical college and hospital.

Methods

The parameters assessed included: (1) characteristics of the ulcer; (2) pain was assessed by NRS-11 at 12-hour intervals for a period of 72 hours; and (3) patient satisfaction. Statistical analysis used repeated measures analysis of variance to measure change in mean NRS-11 within each group. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the mean change in NRS-11 in the 2 groups.

Results

Morphine and loperamide were equivocal in pain relief after 12 and 24 hours (P = 0.400 and P = 0.753); however, the patient satisfaction scores were better in the morphine group.

Limitations

The earlier studies performed used injectable forms of morphine, for the sake of comparison, we used powdered morphine and powdered Loperamide diluted with saline. Confounding variables include ulcer size and aetiology, which can be a source of bias. The ulcer size was not standardized due to the paucity of sample to study. Equianalgesic doses of loperamide and morphine could not be found even after an extensive literature search. The loperamide dose used in our case was equal to the dose used orally since the same dose appears effective across a range of oral opioid analgesics. The morphine dose was standardized as 10 mg based on a mixture previously used to treat pain due to epidermolysis bullosa.

Conclusions

Topical loperamide can be an efficacious and novel intervention to treat painful ulcers while avoiding systemic effects.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^111wDtmH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Rescue loperamide use during the study period

The use of rescue loperamide through weeks 1–12 was reported in approximately one-quarter of patients, with a slightly greater percentage of patients using rescue medication in the placebo group compared with patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg (31.3% vs. 26.7% and 25.6%, respectively; Table 2). The percent of patients reporting rescue use was cumulative and increased slightly across all treatment groups through weeks 1–26, and similar to weeks 1–12, more rescue use was reported in the placebo group compared with the eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg groups (36.0% vs. 32.8% and 31.3%, respectively).

Loperamide rescue was used infrequently through weeks 1–3 and averaged < 1 unit dose per week (range, 0.3–0.8 and 0.2–0.9 unit doses per week in IBS-3001 and IBS-3002, respectively). The use of loperamide rescue each week was similar across all treatment groups, and was similar between the studies. Loperamide rescue use remained < 1 unit dose per week and declined from week 4 through week 26, with an average of 0.2–0.3 unit doses used per week across treatment groups in both studies (data not shown).

### Efficacy and safety of eluxadoline in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea who report inadequate symptom control with loperamide: RELIEF phase 4 study [^1151rtjT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with limited effective treatment options. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide.

Methods

Three hundred forty-six adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were randomly assigned to placebo or eluxadoline 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients recorded daily IBS-D symptoms, including worst abdominal pain (WAP) and stool consistency (through Bristol Stool Scale). The primary endpoint was proportion of composite responders, defined as patients who met daily composite response criteria (≥ 40% WAP improvement and < 5 Bristol Stool Scale score) for at least 50% of treatment days, and recorded ≥ 60 days of diary entries over the 12-week period.

Results

Over 12 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of eluxadoline patients achieved the primary composite responder endpoint compared to placebo (22.7% vs 10.3%, P = 0.002), and component endpoints of improvements in stool consistency (27.9% vs 16.7%, P = 0.01) and WAP (43.6% vs 31.0%, P = 0.02). Additionally, a greater proportion of eluxadoline patients met the composite responder endpoint assessed at monthly intervals compared to placebo (weeks 1–4: 14.0% vs 6.9%, P = 0.03; weeks 5–8: 26.7% vs 14.9%, P = 0.006; weeks 9–12: 30.8% vs 16.7%, P = 0.002). Rates of adverse events were comparable in both groups (37.4% vs 35.3%); no treatment-related serious adverse event, cases of sphincter of Oddi spasm, or pancreatitis were reported.

Discussion

Eluxadoline appears safe and effective for treating IBS-D symptoms in patients with an intact gallbladder reporting inadequate relief with prior loperamide use.

### Racecadotril in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a systematic, comprehensive review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111gon4t]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Blinded actively controlled studies

We have identified only one double-blind, actively controlled multi-center study, which compared racecadotril with loperamide treatment. The study was of high quality due to blinding, definition of a primary endpoint (number of diarrheic stools until recovery), and sample size calculation. Due to the regulatory restriction not to use loperamide in children younger than 2 years, this study recruited a considerably older population than all other studies (Table 1). Also because of regulatory restrictions in the use of loperamide, the study excluded patients having received any antibiotic in the past 30 days or having a current need for antibiotic treatment. Each patient received the respective active treatment plus a placebo matching the other active treatment. The two treatment groups did not differ significantly for the primary endpoint of number of diarrheic stools until recovery (2.7 ± 0.4 stools for racecadotril vs. 2.1 ± 0.4 stools for loperamide) and for secondary endpoints duration of diarrhea (10.7 ± 1.7 vs. 8.8 ± 2.3 h) and recurrence rate (22% vs. 19%). Therefore, the two treatments were concluded to have similar efficacy. However, to achieve this comparable efficacy, almost three times as many patients in the loperamide group required concomitant other medications (8 with anti-emetics, 3 with analgesics, 2 with ORT, and 1 with laxative) as in the racecadotril group (5 with anti-emetics).

Open-label actively controlled studies

Five studies compared the efficacy of racecadotril to that of smectite (total of 399 vs. 395 patients), three of which included a probiotic as part of shared background treatment (Table 1). Two of these studies reported a comparable efficacy of racecadotril and smectite, for instance for global efficacy and cure rate after 72 h and in one of these studies also for time to cure and duration of hospitalization. Of note, one of these studies also had included an arm with combination of smectite and racecadotril and found this to be more effective than either monotherapy. Three other studies, however, reported a superiority of racecadotril over smectite for global efficacy, cure rate after 72 h, number of stools on the first, second and third day of treatment, time to cure, duration of treatment and duration of hospitalization.

### Methadone management of withdrawal associated with loperamide-related opioid use disorder [^111spwRg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide hydrochloride is an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal agent, acting via mu-opioid receptor agonist effects in the intestinal myenteric plexus. Although preclinical investigations suggested that abuse liability associated with loperamide use is low, there are increasing numbers of cases reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, of abuse, dependence, and withdrawal associated with loperamide use. A case of a patient with opioid use disorder, that is, in the form of protracted loperamide excess use, requiring management of withdrawal with methadone is presented. Management of withdrawal from abrupt loperamide discontinuation has not been discussed in the literature. Long-term treatment issues are also described.

### Dysrhythmias with loperamide used for opioid withdrawal [^115x3aAU]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The antidiarrheal loperamide has had a recent, drastic increase in off-label use as an alternative treatment for symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The concept of this is easily discovered on the Internet and social media, where there are multiple blogs and forums promoting loperamide use at doses of 70 to 200 mg per day. Unfortunately, the serious side effects are not well recognized. Multiple cases of cardiac dysrhythmias contributing to death have been highlighted in recent literature. In November 2016, the US Food & Drug Administration released a statement highlighting the potential heart effects and risk of death with high doses of loperamide. 1 This case regards a 22-year-old who took 200 mg of loperamide per day for 2 years as an alternative to methadone in her attempts to wean off heroin. Her subsequent spontaneous collapse, dysrhythmias, and acute hospital treatment are reviewed in detail as they were contradictory to standard therapy and required a multidisciplinary approach. Her outpatient management addressed the complex biological, psychological, and social aspects of her addiction.

### Keeping the cecum clean: a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trial of loperamide as part of preparation for colonoscopy [^113DXFnK]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Coating of the cecum with sticky bile causes a problem with inspection of the mucosa during colonoscopy.

Purpose

This study aimed to see whether 4 mg of loperamide taken after colonoscopy preparation would delay the passage of bile and improve the quality of cecal preparation.

Patients

Patients undergoing office colonoscopy were included. Patients with incomplete colonoscopies or right colectomy were excluded.

Study Design

This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial.

Intervention

Either 2 placebo capsules or 2 loperamide capsules were taken after gut lavage, as soon as the passage of liquid stool ceased. Cecal photographs were scored in a blinded fashion.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes measured were the quality of cecal preparation on a scale of 1 to 5 and overall preparation on a scale of 1 to 4.

Results

Ninety-eight patients took loperamide (50 men, 48 women) and 102 took placebo (57 men, 45 women). Mean ages of the loperamide group were: men, 61.9 ± 11.9 years, and women, 61.8 ± 10.0 years; and mean ages of the placebo group were: men, 62.5 ± 12.1 years, and women, 58.6 ± 9.8 years. Over 90% of patients used a polyethylene glycol-based preparation. Thirteen of 102 (12.7%) placebo cases had a dirty or coated cecum (score 4 or 5). In the loperamide group, this number was 2 of 98 (2.0%; p = 0.0041). Nineteen placebo cases (18.6%) had an overall fair/poor preparation in comparison with 9 of the loperamide group (9.2%; p = 0.0543). Days to first bowel movement were 2.4 ± 1.1 for loperamide and 2.5 ± 1.7 for placebo (p = 0.7224). Fifty-eight percent of loperamide patients had polyps, and 74% of these patients had multiple polyps; 67% of placebo patients had polyps, but only 54% of these patients had multiple polyps (vs loperamide, p = 0.0183).

Conclusion

Judicious use of loperamide can significantly improve the quality of cecal preparation and may increase polyp yield.

### Loperamide dependence and abuse [^117LV2dH]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Loperamide is a common over-the-counter antidiarrheal considered safe in a broad range of dosages and thought devoid of abuse potential. We describe the first case of a patient with loperamide dependence due to misuse of its opiate-like effects achieved by chronic massive oral ingestions. A 26-year-old man who was taking 800mg of loperamide per day presented requesting detoxification referral. Loperamide has potential for euphoric effects and information on how to facilitate such effects is easily available. It is important for physicians to be aware of the potential for misuse of and dependence on loperamide, with symptoms mimicking opiate use.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^111ge3CM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

These studies were not designed for direct comparison of the efficacy of eluxadoline with that of loperamide, especially with respect to long-term therapy, as only ∼14% of patients took loperamide chronically. The extent to which one agent works better than the other for the individual symptoms of diarrhea or abdominal pain, or a composite of both, remains unclear and no conclusions can be drawn with respect to comparison of the two agents. It is notable, however, that the small studies performed previously, evaluating the efficacy of loperamide for the treatment of IBS-D, did not include the combined responder end point now required by the FDA. Direct comparison of the efficacy and safety of loperamide with that of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D using up-to-date end points remains an important area for future investigation.

During the 12- and 26-week phase 3 studies, loperamide was available for study patients to use as a rescue medication; its use was less common in patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg compared with those who received placebo (25.6% and 26.7% vs. 31.3%, respectively), and this may suggest superior treatment satisfaction with eluxadoline. Using imputed nonresponse when rescue loperamide was used, these analyses demonstrated that the use of rescue loperamide in the two phase 3 studies did not affect the composite responder rates with eluxadoline compared with placebo, and patients receiving eluxadoline 75 or 100 mg showed significantly higher responder rates than the placebo group (25.6% and 26.9% vs. 16.4%, respectively). The exact reasons for rescue loperamide use were not collected in these studies.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: an underestimated therapeutic option? [^115nDBjx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Among antidiarrheal drugs loperamide, racecadotril, and bismuth salicylate, much less used, are the possible options.

Racecadotril showed better tolerability compared to loperamide, being less frequently associated with constipation and other side effects. Constipation related to loperamide treatment may also lead to severe complications like bacterial retention, which is harmful because AID could be induced by toxin-producing bacteria. Furthermore, loperamide has a certain potential of DDI being metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 enzyme isoforms of cytochrome p450 (CYP450). Extrusion by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) limits loperamide central nervous system (CNS) side effects but the presence of P-gp inhibitors may eventually promote loperamide access to CNS. Despite the possible risks related to these mechanisms, loperamide is a drug very easy to access even as an over-the-counter product, and it is probably the most frequent therapeutic solution chosen by many adult patients.

Racecadotril offers a safe option both in adults and in children after the 3 months of age, whereas loperamide is recommended only for subjects ⩾12 years old.

Many trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses in children agreed showing that adding racecadotril to ORS reduces stool output and diarrhea duration in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Based on this evidence, racecadotril has been recommended for the treatment of AID in children by many international guidelines, from the ones by the World Gastroenterology Organizationand by ESPGHAN/ESPID (European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases), the panels' guidelines panel from Spain and Latin America, and the recommendations by the German Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. In addition, the Italian Ministry of Health, in its webpage regarding the treatment of traveler's diarrhea, recommends the use of racecadotril.

### Epidemiologic trends in loperamide abuse and Misuse [^1145WPg2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Loperamide abuse has been increasing in the United States as a potential alternative to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use. In June 2016, the Food and Drug Administration warned health care providers and the general public about potential serious adverse outcomes, including cardiac dysrhythmias and death. The purpose of this study is to determine recent trends in intentional loperamide abuse and misuse, reported clinical effects and management, and medical outcomes as reported to poison centers across the United States.

Methods

Loperamide exposures reported to the National Poison Data System indicating intentional misuse, abuse, and suspected suicide between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, were assessed. Demographic and temporal trends, as well as reported clinical effects, medical management, and health outcomes, were analyzed.

Results

There was a 91% increase in reported exposures from 2010 to 2015, of which half were single-agent loperamide use only. Loperamide exposures reported to the National Poison Data System increased at approximately 38 cases per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.5 to 42.9; P < 0.0001). Fifteen deaths were reported during this time frame, of which 8 involved single-agent loperamide abuse.

Conclusion

Loperamide abuse and misuse are projected to increase in the absence of any methods to reduce exposure or curb abuse. Health care providers should consider the potential for loperamide toxicity when managing patients with opioidlike toxicity.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: an underestimated therapeutic option? [^115HU9bM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multicenter single-blinded study in a wide population (945 outpatients) with AID, Prado documented that racecadotril reduced the duration of diarrhea (primary efficacy endpoint) and of abdominal pain duration, compared to loperamide. In the racecadotril group, constipation was less frequent than in loperamide-treated patients. Overall, 67 (14.2%) patients in the racecadotril group and 113 (23.9%) in the loperamide group (p = 0.001) experienced side effects.

Wang et al. performed a randomized single-blinded study aimed at comparing loperamide (2 mg b.i.d.) and racecadotril (100 mg t.i.d.) in 62 patients with AID. The authors documented that loperamide was faster in treating diarrhea versus racecadotril (13 h vs 19.5 h), but it induced the development of constipation.

### Loperamide-induced hypopituitarism [^111FKaix]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Loperamide, a phenylpiperidine derivative and a potent opioid μ-receptor agonist, is the most commonly used antidiarrhoeal medication in the UK. About 1.79 million prescriptions were issued in 2014and it is also freely available 'over the counter'. Its popularity persists due to a combination of favourable efficacy and a reasonably limited side effect profile; predictable gastrointestinal side effects do occur, but it is widely considered to be a very safe and well-tolerated medication.

Loperamide is directly absorbed into the gut wall, exerting its effect on the myenteric plexus to reduce propulsive activity and increase intestinal transit time. Although gastrointestinal tract absorption is favourable, it is rapidly extracted by hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism resulting in low levels in the systemic circulation (bioavailability < 2%). While extensively used in acute diarrhoea, a significant proportion of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disease take loperamide on a daily basis, often at relatively high doses. Prior studies have paid scant attention to the potential adverse effects of longer term ingestion.

We report a serious and hitherto undocumented adverse effect of chronic loperamide use following presentation to the endocrine clinic.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^112swKYd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high prevalence of IBS ensures that many health-care providers across diverse specialties will encounter patients with IBS in their practice. There is therefore a need for health-care providers to properly evaluate and treat patients with IBS. However, the treatment of IBS-D remains problematic for many providers for a number of reasons, including the lack of validated treatment guidelines, the lack of familiarity with effective therapies, the absence of prospective studies evaluating sequential therapy for IBS-D, the lack of head-to-head comparison studies directly comparing different therapeutic agents, and the inherent heterogeneity of the disease, with the result that a large proportion of patients with IBS-D express dissatisfaction with the treatment received for their IBS symptoms. The persistence of diarrhea in IBS-D leads many health-care providers to recommend an over-the-counter agent, such as loperamide, that is inexpensive and generally considered safe, although it has little effect on the symptoms of abdominal pain or bloating.

Eluxadoline was approved by the FDA in May 2015 for the treatment of both men and women with IBS-D, and represents a treatment option for patients including those with inadequate symptom control with the common over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent loperamide. Eluxadoline significantly improved the overall symptoms of IBS-D in two large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies involving > 2,400 patients, during 12 and 26 weeks of treatment, respectively, when compared with placebo. The results from the present analysis demonstrate that over one-third of the patients enrolled in these two phase 3 trials reported loperamide use in the year before study enrollment; however, inadequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide was reported in 59–67% of these patients. These phase 3 studies are among the largest to report on prior loperamide use in patients with IBS-D. The authors acknowledge that unanticipated selection bias may have predisposed entry of patients who had previously experienced inadequate symptom control with loperamide use, especially as the initial question only asked for recall of loperamide use within the prior year. Regardless, the cause of inadequate symptom control with loperamide in the third of patients who admitted to using loperamide is likely to be multifactorial. Importantly, the survey instrument did not capture precise reasons for treatment failure (such as persistent abdominal pain or persistent diarrhea).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114v8WfZ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Dosing recommendations for prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis indicate primary prophylaxis as ARV therapy to avoid advanced immune deficiency (ARV = antiretroviral). For treatment, Effective ART (ART = antiretroviral therapy) is listed and immune reconstitution might lead to parasitologic and clinical response. As an alternative, there is no consistently effective therapy for cryptosporidiosis in patients with HIV infection; optimized ART and a trial of nitazoxanide should be considered. Nitazoxanide dosing is: 1–3 years of age, 20 mg/mL oral solution 100 mg orally twice daily with food; 4–11 years of age, 20 mg/mL oral solution 200 mg orally twice daily with food; ≥ 12 years of age, tablet 500 mg orally twice daily with food. Treatment duration is 3–14 days. Supportive care includes hydration, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional support. Antimotility agents (such as loperamide) should be used with caution in young children.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Controlled Substance

Loperamide is not a controlled substance.

Abuse

Loperamide is a mu-opioid agonist. A human abuse potential study of loperamide hydrochloride at single doses up to 60 mg (3.75 times the recommended maximum adult dosage of 16 mg per day) was compared, in a double-blind cross-over design using nine subjects who had been active opiate users, to a threshold dose of codeine sulfate at 120 mg (96 mg base) or placebo. This resulted in one subject (11%) feeling a drug on placebo and identifying it as "dope" (heroin) and liking it slightly. Codeine was felt by 56% of subjects and identified as "dope" by 44%. Loperamide was felt by 44% of subjects and identified as "dope" by 11% and possibly dope mixed with some other kind of drug by another 22%. Loperamide abuse and misuse have been reported, especially at doses of 60 mg or greater. Loperamide can have greater CNS opioid effects at higher doses or with coadministration of drugs that increase systemic exposure and/or increase CNS penetration of loperamide (through inhibition of the CYP450 enzyme system or inhibition of P-glycoprotein). Loperamide is primarily being misused for relief from opioid withdrawal, and abused by a few users who obtain some (reportedly mild-moderate) level of euphoria\.

Dependence

In animals, parenteral administration of loperamide hydrochloride can cause physical dependence, cross-tolerance to opioids, and all the other pharmacologic effects typical of mu-opioid agonists. Studies in morphine-dependent monkeys demonstrated that loperamide hydrochloride at doses above those recommended for humans prevented signs of morphine withdrawal.

### Loperamide misuse to avoid opioid withdrawal and to achieve a euphoric effect: high doses and high risk [^111DMQ1R]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Loperamide is a readily accessible nonprescription medication that is increasingly being used surreptitiously as an opioid substitute to alleviate the symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with loperamide misuse and toxicity.

Methods

The ToxIC registry, a nationwide, prospectively collected cohort of patients evaluated by medical toxicologists was searched from November 2011-December 2016 for patients with loperamide exposure. Each record was reviewed to determine the circumstances, dose, clinical presentations, treatment, and outcomes associated with loperamide use.

Results

Twenty-six cases were identified, and both the absolute number and relative proportion of overall cases in the ToxIC registry increased annually. The median age was 27 and 54% were male. Of cases with known intent (n = 18), 12(67%) were misuse/abuse, 3(17%) were self-harm/suicide, and 3(17%) were pediatric exploratory ingestions. Circumstances for misuse included taking higher doses than labeled (n = 7), avoiding withdrawal (n = 6), and gaining a pleasurable sensation (n = 4). The dose was reported in nine cases and ranged from 4mg to 400mg. In patients seeking to avoid withdrawal doses were 160-400mg/day; the most common reported dose was 200mg. Reported ECG abnormalities included 10 cases of prolonged QTc (> 500ms), which consisted of misuse/abuse (n = 6) and self-harm (n = 1) exposures; six prolonged QRS (> 120ms); two first degree AV block; seven ventricular dysrhythmias, five of which were single-agent exposures. All but one ECG demonstrated prolonged QTc with a range of 566-749ms. All patients with dysrhythmias in which dose were reported ingested ≥ 200mg.

Conclusions

The majority of patients had loperamide toxicity due to misuse/abuse, in-line with national trends. In patients avoiding withdrawal, doses > 100mg were observed. When taken in large doses (> 200mg), loperamide may cause significant cardiovascular effects, including QTc-prolongation and ventricular dysrhythmias.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^111vPYv1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety

Overall, among patients with prior loperamide use with inadequate prior symptom control, over half in each treatment group experienced ≥ 1 AE (placebo: 50.6% eluxadoline 75 mg: 59.3% eluxadoline 100 mg: 61.0% Table 3). The most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in any treatment group) were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and headache. GI AEs tended to be more common in eluxadoline-treated patients, although the incidence was generally low (< 11% Table 3).

GI AEs were reported in approximately one-third of patients who used rescue loperamide during the studies, across the treatment groups (placebo: 24.7% eluxadoline 75 mg: 34.2% eluxadoline 100 mg: 31.7% Table 4). Of these patients, over half in each treatment group reported ≥ 1 GI AE with an onset date after a dose of loperamide (placebo: 16.6% eluxadoline 75 mg: 22.1% eluxadoline 100 mg: 21.4%). There was no clear association between the timing of loperamide rescue medication use and the reporting of GI AEs, with the majority of events reported > 14 days after the most recent loperamide dose. In those patients who had used rescue loperamide during the studies, the most common GI AEs reported (occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in any treatment group) included constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea (Table 4). Constipation tended to be more common in patients treated with eluxadoline 100 mg compared with eluxadoline 75 mg or placebo (6.1% vs. 3.7% and 1.4%, respectively), although incidence was generally low. The incidence of constipation in these patients was similar to that observed in the full phase 3 population safety set (placebo: 2.5% eluxadoline 75 mg: 7.4% eluxadoline 100 mg: 8.6% (B.D. Cash et al. unpublished data)).

### Definition of loperamide hydrochloride-NCI dictionary of cancer… [^112YbiXV]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

loperamide hydrochlorideListen to pronunciationA drug used to treat diarrhea. Loperamide hydrochloride works by binding to mu opioid receptors in the intestines, which slows the movement of the muscles in the intestines. This gives the body more time to absorb water and electrolytes from the feces, resulting in firmer and less frequent bowel movements. Loperamide hydrochloride is a type of synthetic opioid agonist that works only in the gut when used as directed. Also called Imodium.

### Loperamide abuse associated with cardiac dysrhythmia and Death [^1155MACV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter antidiarrheal with μ-opioid agonist activity. Central nervous system opioid effects are not observed after therapeutic oral dosing because of poor bioavailability and minimal central nervous system penetration. However, central nervous system opioid effects do occur after supratherapeutic oral doses. Recently, oral loperamide abuse as an opioid substitute has been increasing among patients attempting to self-treat their opioid addiction. Ventricular dysrhythmias and prolongation of the QRS duration and QTc interval have been reported after oral loperamide abuse. We describe 2 fatalities in the setting of significantly elevated loperamide concentrations.

### Long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder: a case series [^11276sPi]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Current data suggest that the opioid epidemic represents a worsening problem in the United States. However, prescribing rates of opioids have been steadily declining, suggesting that alternative opioids are becoming a major contributor to this crisis. One medication that has shown an increase in nonmedical use is loperamide. Loperamide is a peripheral mu-opioid agonist that is intended to be used for diarrhea. However, when taken at high doses and/or in combination with P-glycoprotein inhibitors, it acts centrally by penetrating the blood-brain-barrier. Loperamide crossing the blood-brain-barrier results in similar central nervous system depression as other opioids. Loperamide's over-the-counter availability and growing media presence has resulted in more cases of loperamide substance use disorder, predominantly to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms and to produce a euphoric state. This case series presents 3 patients with loperamide-associated opioid use disorder who have been successfully treated with on-going buprenorphine treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case-series to explore long-term buprenorphine treatment for loperamide use disorder. Our findings suggest that buprenorphine can be used for loperamide use disorder, most effectively when patients are in mild to moderate withdrawal. These cases also demonstrate how different waiting times were necessary before starting buprenorphine treatment in order to avoid precipitated withdrawal.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^113LUYsh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics

In total, 2,428 patients were included in the enrolled set. The mean age ranged from 44.4 ± 13.9 to 47.1 ± 13.8 years, and the majority of patients were female in both studies (range across treatment groups, 64.8–68.5%). The mean daily worst abdominal pain score was > 6 across all treatment groups and the average number of daily bowel movements ranged from 4.7 ± 2.2 to 5.0 ± 3.0.

Patterns of loperamide usage in the year before randomization

Loperamide use in the year before randomization was balanced across treatment groups, and 873 (36.0%) patients reported prior loperamide use (Table 1). Of the patients with prior loperamide use, inadequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide was reported in 538 patients across all treatment groups (placebo: 58.9% eluxadoline 75 mg: 67.1% eluxadoline 100 mg: 58.8%). The pattern of loperamide use before randomization tended to be mostly acute across all patients who reported prior loperamide use, ranging from 84.5 to 88.3%, whereas chronic use of loperamide before randomization was less common (Table 1).

Altmetric: Citations: Views: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Figure Loperamide is an over-the-counter antidiarrheal with opioid-receptor agonist properties. Recommended over-the-counter doses do not produce opioid effects in the central nervous system because of poor oral bioavailability and P-glycoprotein efflux of the medication; recent reports suggest that large doses of loperamide produce euphoria, central nervous system depression, and cardiotoxicity. Abuse of loperamide for its euphoric effect or for self-treatment of opioid withdrawal is increasing. The average reported daily dose was 358 mg. Previous opioid abuse was reported by 15 patients, previous treatment with methadone or buprenorphine by eight patients, and chronic abuse by 13 patients.

Opioid withdrawal symptoms after cessation of loperamide were reported by nine patients. Serum loperamide concentrations were obtained from four patients and ranged from 77–210 ng/mL, representing 25–875 times the therapeutic range of 0. 24–3. 1 ng/mL, and nearly all cases involved tablets or capsules. Cardiac conduction disturbances were reported in 24 patients, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 16 patients, other dysrhythmias in 10 patients, and other electrocardiogram changes in five patients. Outcome was reported for 132 patients and was coded as moderate or major for 66 patients. Four deaths were reported. These cases support the reported association between loperamide abuse and cardiac toxicity.

Although laboratory confirmation was only available in four cases, clinical features were consistent with previously reported cases (. FIGURE. Number of reported cases of intentional loperamide abuse, by year — National Poison Database System, January 1, 2008–March 31, 2016.

### Prevention of sacituzumab govitecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (PRIMED): an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^113qMyYf]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea was also one of the most common adverse events in the ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials, occurring at any grade in 60% of the patients, with about 30% of patients having diarrhea ≥ grade 2 (∼10% grade 3). In PRIMED, the primary prophylaxis with loperamide resulted in a numerical reduction of the incidence of diarrhea of any grade and ≥ grade 2–34% and 16%, respectively, during the first two cycles, although this improvement did not reach statistical significance. However, it is important to note that loperamide administration was associated wih a higher incidence of constipation of any grade (46% during the first two cycles), mainly grade 1, compared to that observed in ASCENT (17%) and TROPiCS-02 (37%) trials, respectively. The increased incidence of constipation and the lack of statistically significant benefit in reducing diarrhea observed in PRIMED underscores that the optimal dosing and scheduling of loperamide prophylaxis remain to be defined. Further studies are warranted to refine the prophylactic approach, potentially comparing higher but limited dosing schedules versus lower, continuous regimens, or exploring individualized strategies based on patient-specific risk factors.

Dose reductions, temporary dose interruptions, and treatment discontinuations due to adverse events, mainly neutropenia and diarrhea, occurred in around 20–30%, 60%, and 5% of the patients included in ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials, respectively. In PRIMED, the primary prophylaxis with G-CSF and loperamide led to a notable decrease in dose reductions (14.0%) and temporary treatment interruptions (30.0%), and no treatment discontinuations during the first two cycles. Additionally, these rates remained low with extended follow-up.

Regarding antitumor activity, median PFS, ORR, and CBR were 6.24 months, 28.0%, and 62.0%, respectively. These results are slightly better than those reported in ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials despite PRIMED included a less pretreated patient population and the improvement in tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan that led to a significant reduction in treatment modifications.

Study end points

Primary end points

The primary end point was the number of patients who did not experience diarrhoea. This primary end point was measured using two different approaches to defining diarrhoea, first using physician assessment based on NCI CTC grade and second using a patient-reported outcome from data recorded in daily diaries. A responder was a patient who did not experience diarrhoea and was defined by the following criteria: A patient who did not have diarrhoea according to NCI CTC v3.0 grading or a patient who had ≤ 4 bowel movements on all study days of each cycle. Partial responders were defined as those with a reduction of one NCI grade of diarrhoea on treatment. Response was evaluated in two time periods of the first day of chemotherapy (acute phase) and from day 1 to the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy (full cycle).

Secondary end points

A number of secondary end points were derived from the patients' diaries. These included the use of rescue medication (number of loperamide and codeine phosphate tablets used and days of usage) and mean scores for severity of diarrhoea and of other associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, constipation and abdominal pain and cramps as scored by the patient on an overall severity scale of 0–3 (0, 1, 2 and 3 representing none, mild, moderate and severe, respectively).

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^1157mY4J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, eluxadoline is a therapeutic agent with a unique mechanism of action approved for the treatment of IBS-D in both men and women. A large phase 2 study and two large, prospective phase 3 studies have demonstrated that eluxadoline can effectively treat simultaneous symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients with IBS-D. The current analyses demonstrate that eluxadoline can effectively treat IBS-D symptoms in patients who report inadequate relief with prior loperamide as well as in those who report adequate relief with prior loperamide. In addition, patients who took loperamide as a rescue medication during blinded study participation had nearly identical response rates and did not exhibit a greater number of AEs as compared with the population overall. These findings are clinically relevant as they demonstrate to health-care providers that eluxadoline is an efficacious and safe treatment option for the majority of patients diagnosed with IBS-D, irrespective of prior treatment experience with loperamide.

### Intentional misuse and abuse of loperamide: a new look at a drug with "Low abuse potential" [^115S22o1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its opioid properties, loperamide has long been thought to have low abuse potential due to its poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and limited potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. A recent patient reportedly taking loperamide to avoid heroin withdrawal symptoms, at doses approximately 100 times those recommended, directed our attention to this issue.

Objectives

1) Investigate number of cases of intentional loperamide abuse and misuse reported to poison centers between 2009 and 2015; 2) Compile reports of clinical effects of loperamide abuse; and 3) Search for evidence of increasing Internet interest in the central opioid effects of loperamide.

Methods

For the years 2009 thru 2015, we reviewed exposure calls related to misuse/abuse of loperamide in the Texas Poison Center Network's database and the National Poison Data System. We used Google trend analysis to detect evidence of increased Internet interest in the illicit use of loperamide.

Results

Between 2009 and 2015, the number of misuse/abuse calls related to loperamide alone nearly doubled, with about one-third of cases occurring in teens and young adults in their 20s. Of particular concern are reports of significant cardiotoxic effects (∼18% of cases), including conduction defects and various dysrhythmias, sometimes leading to death. Google Trends analysis demonstrates an increasing number of searches for "loperamide high" and "loperamide withdrawal" beginning in 2011.

Conclusions

Loperamide misuse/abuse seems to be on the rise. Given its propensity to induce conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias at very high doses, emergency physicians should be vigilant for this form of drug abuse.

### Prevention of sacituzumab govitecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (PRIMED): an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^111WUnCD]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Neutropenia and diarrhea are important adverse events related to sacituzumab govitecan administration as they can cause treatment discontinuations, dose modifications, and can negatively impact QoL. To our knowledge, PRIMED is the first published trial to specifically evaluate preventative measures to improve the tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan. The study demonstrated that primary prophylactic administration of G-CSF and loperamide resulted in a statistically significant reduction of the incidence and severity of sacituzumab govitecan-related neutropenia and in a numerically and clinically relevant reduction of the incidence and severity of sacituzumab govitecan-related diarrhea. These data suggest that this strategy could be used to limit treatment discontinuations and dose modifications for patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with this anticancer agent.

The ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan, however, in both trials, around 60–70% of the patients had neutropenia of any grade and about 50% of patients presented neutropenia ≥ grade 3. In PRIMED, primary prophylaxis with loperamide resulted in a numerical reduction in the incidence of diarrhea of any grade and ≥ grade 2–34% and 16%, respectively, during the first two cycles, although this improvement did not reach statistical significance. However, it is important to note that loperamide administration was associated with a higher incidence of constipation of any grade (46% during the first two cycles), mainly grade 1, compared to that observed in ASCENT (17%) and TROPiCS-02 (37%) trials, respectively.

### Eluxadoline efficacy in IBS-D patients who report prior loperamide use [^111Vp4DR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Assessments

Patients were asked during the screening phase of both phase 3 studies whether they had used loperamide for their IBS-D over the past year (yes/no). Patients indicating prior loperamide use were asked whether loperamide was used acutely (defined as use for short-term relief, typically not exceeding 6 days of consecutive daily use), or chronically (defined as continuous use for maintenance therapy, typically exceeding ≥ 2 weeks of consecutive daily use), and whether loperamide had provided adequate control of their IBS symptoms (yes/no).

Use of over-the-counter loperamide rescue medication, purchased by the patient and reimbursed by the sponsor, was permitted during the treatment period for the acute treatment of uncontrolled diarrhea. A dose of 2 mg of loperamide was permitted once every 6 h, with the following guidelines: no more than 4 unit doses over a continuous 24 h time period (8 mg/day), no more than 7 unit doses over a continuous 48 h time period (14 mg over 2 days), and no more than 11 unit doses over a continuous 7-day time period (22 mg over 7 days). Patients were asked to record their use of loperamide rescue in electronic diaries for 26 weeks (IBS-3001) or 30 weeks (IBS-3002). Use of above the permitted amount of loperamide initiated an automatic alert to the investigator. In the event of excessive loperamide rescue use, the status of the patient was to be evaluated by the investigator as soon as possible. Treatment discontinuation in the event of excessive loperamide rescue use was at the discretion of the investigator.

Safety assessments

Safety and tolerability of eluxadoline were monitored throughout the studies through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, concomitant medications, and physical examinations.

### Prevention of sacituzumab govitecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (PRIMED): an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^112NKzfS]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To address these side effects, cancer patients are commonly treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) and loperamide for drug-associated neutropenia and diarrhea, respectively, when they appear. In ASCENT, roughly one-third of the patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan required secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF and around half of patients received loperamide. These findings reinforce the clinical importance of implementing effective prophylactic strategies to proactively manage treatment-related adverse events. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the benefit of prophylactic administration of different treatments in combination with anticancer therapy to decrease the incidence and severity of adverse events.

The PRIMED study, therefore, aimed to evaluate if primary prophylactic administration of G-CSF and loperamide could help mitigate these side effects with the aim of improving the tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan. By optimizing the management of these toxicities, clinicians could help maintain treatment adherence, improve patient outcomes, and enhance overall QoL for patients receiving sacituzumab govitecan.

Travel and breastfeeding — travelers' diarrhea (TD) treatment — exclusive breastfeeding helps protect children against TD and breastfeeding is ideal rehydration therapy; children suspected of having TD should breastfeed more frequently and should not be offered other fluids or foods that replace breastfeeding, and breastfeeding travelers with TD should continue breastfeeding if possible and increase their own fluid intake, with evidence lacking that any TD pathogen can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding travelers should avoid bismuth subsalicylate compounds in over-the-counter antidiarrheals, fluoroquinolones and macrolides are excreted in breast milk and clinicians should consult the breastfed child's primary healthcare professional before deciding which antibiotics to prescribe; most experts consider the short-term use of azithromycin compatible with breastfeeding, loperamide is another preferred antidiarrheal medication to use while breastfeeding, and use of oral rehydration salts is fully compatible with breastfeeding.

### Loperamide versus psyllium fiber for treatment of fecal incontinence: the fecal incontinence prescription (Rx) management (FIRM) randomized clinical trial [^116pyemD]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal incontinence is a devastating condition with few US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic treatment options. Loperamide and psyllium, both first-line treatments, have different mechanisms of action without any comparative data.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of loperamide compared with psyllium for reducing fecal incontinence. We hypothesized that psyllium fiber supplementation would be more effective than loperamide for reducing fecal incontinence episodes and have fewer adverse effects.

Design

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial comparing loperamide (followed by psyllium) with psyllium (followed by loperamide).

Settings

Our sites included outpatient clinics within a Veterans Affairs medical center and university affiliate.

Patients

Participants included community-dwelling adults (n = 80) with at least 1 fecal incontinent episode on a 7-day bowel diary.

Intervention

Participants received either daily loperamide (plus placebo psyllium powder) or psyllium powder (plus loperamide placebo) for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout, participants crossed over to 4 weeks of alternate treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the number of fecal incontinence episodes from 7-day bowel diaries. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity, quality of life, and tolerability.

Results

Mean age was 60.7 ± 10.1 years; 68% were men. After determining nonsignificant carryover effects, combined analyses showed no differences between the loperamide and psyllium groups for reducing fecal incontinent episodes, symptom severity, or quality of life. Within each group, both loperamide and psyllium reduced fecal incontinent episodes and improved symptom severity and quality of life. Constipation occurred in 29% of participants for loperamide vs 10% for psyllium.

Limitations

Limitations include the washout period length and dropout rate after crossing over to the second intervention.

Conclusions

Both loperamide and psyllium improve fecal incontinence. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects, especially constipation.

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

Best Practice Advice 6: Pharmacologic therapy — Antimotility and antisecretory agents are frequently necessary to control stool losses in SBS. Massive enterectomy–related gastric hypersecretion and hypergastrinemia may last 6–12 months postoperatively, and antisecretory medications (proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists) are beneficial; some specialists have suggested that acid-suppressing agents should be used sparingly beyond 12 months unless there is clear evidence of persistent benefit. Octreotide may reduce secretions and slow transit but has not been shown to improve absorption or reduce the need for PN, may worsen malabsorption, should generally be reserved for large stool losses with problematic fluid and electrolyte management, and should be avoided during the period of intestinal adaptation. Antidiarrheals reduce motility; commonly used agents include loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, codeine, and tincture of opium, with loperamide preferred because it is not addictive or sedative; use should be guided by objective measurements of stool output, and loperamide and codeine may have a synergistic effect. In SBS without an ileum, high loperamide doses are frequently needed (ie, up to 16 tablets [32 mg]/d), and these agents seem to be most effective when administered about 30 minutes before meals.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^112JjBCh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy in acute diarrheal infections (adults) — indications and comparative evidence: Antibiotics should be used for cases of dysentery and moderate-to-severe traveler's diarrhea where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence), and use of antibiotics for community-acquired diarrhea should be discouraged as most community-acquired diarrhea is viral and is not shortened by antibiotics (Strong recommendation, very low level evidence). For travelers' diarrhea, the evidence for the use of anti-microbial therapy is strongly supported, with antibiotics shortening the overall duration of moderate-to-severe TD to a little over 24h and reducing time to last unformed stool by 1–3 days compared with no therapy or placebo; combination of an antibiotic with loperamide further shortens duration of illness. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin have been the primary antibiotics of choice, but resistance — particularly among Campylobacter — means the use of macrolides such as azithromycin for treatment is recommended, and azithromycin was shown to be more effective than ciprofloxacin for all cases of TD in travelers to Thailand. For all antibiotics, either single-dose therapy or treatment for up to 3 days is usually sufficient; studies show that once daily therapy is as effective as 3-day therapies for TD due to noninvasive pathogens, and a 3-day therapy is recommended for patients presenting with fever or dysentery. Short-course fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotic use has demonstrated risks of development of Clostridium difficile infection and risks for tendinopathies and arthropathies.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^116CvA34]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

Loperamide non-cardiac arrhythmia overdosages should be treated as opioid overdosages. Naloxone may reverse the opioid-related toxicity, including CNS and respiratory depression, and hypotension, associated with loperamide overdosage.

In adults and pediatric patients, naloxone may be administered intravenously. Appropriate doses of naloxone, via intranasal, intramuscular, intraosseus, or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. If the desired degree of opioid-related toxicity counteraction and improvement are not obtained, naloxone may be repeated at two- to three-minute intervals. If no response in opioid-related effects is observed after naloxone has been administered, then diagnosis of opioid-induced toxicity should be questioned.

Refer to the naloxone prescribing information for complete information on initial and subsequent dosages.

For patients whose adverse reactions are responsive to naloxone, monitor vital signs, neurologic and cardiopulmonary status for recurrence of opioid overdose symptoms for at least 24 hours after the last dose of naloxone, due to the prolonged intestinal retention of loperamide and the short duration (one to three hours) of naloxone. Patients with severe CNS or respiratory depression, and those who require multiple doses of naloxone to reverse symptoms, should be admitted to the hospital and may require intensive care.

Laboratory Testing

Standard drug screens for opioids do not include an assay for loperamide; such testing for opioids will yield negative results even in the presence of loperamide.

### Prevention of sacituzumab govitecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (PRIMED): an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^112fSJAR]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Neutropenia and diarrhea are common sacituzumab govitecan-related adverse events, frequently leading to treatment modifications. PRIMED evaluated primary prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and loperamide to improve sacituzumab govitecan tolerability.

Methods

PRIMED was an open-label, single-arm, phase II study that enrolled HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients previously treated with 1–2 chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients with hormone receptor positive tumors previously received CDK4/6 inhibitor in the advanced setting. Sacituzumab govitecan was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. G-CSF (5 MU/kg/day) and loperamide (2 mg/twice a day or 4 mg/day) were given during the first two cycles and at physician's discretion thereafter. Primary endpoints were (i) incidence of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and (ii) incidence of grade ≥ 2 diarrhea, both assessed after two treatment cycles. Secondary endpoints included efficacy and extended safety.

Findings

Between February 2023 and September 2023, 50 patients were enrolled. At data cut-off, median follow-up was 9.0 months (range, 0.2–13.5). Disease progression was the main reason for treatment discontinuation (33 patients, 66.0%). During the first two cycles, incidence of any grade neutropenia and diarrhea were 28.0% and 34.0%, respectively. Eight patients (16.0%) had ≥ grade 3 neutropenia, meeting this primary endpoint (p = 0.00023). No patients developed febrile neutropenia. Eight patients (16.0%) had ≥ grade 2 diarrhea (4.0% grade 3) (p = 0.084). The rate of adverse events associated with dose reductions and temporary treatment interruptions during the first two cycles was 14.0% and 30.0%, respectively.

Interpretation

Primary prophylactic administration of G-CSF and loperamide resulted in a clinically relevant reduction of the incidence and severity of sacituzumab govitecan-related neutropenia and diarrhea.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^114Y4oya]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Avoid loperamide hydrochloride dosages higher than recommended in adult or pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, OVERDOSAGE).

(1 capsule = 2 mg)

Patients should receive appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.

Acute Diarrhea

Adults and Pediatric Patients 13 Years and Older: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool. The maximum daily dose should is 16 mg (eight capsules). Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 12 Years of Age: In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (loperamide hydrochloride oral solution, 1 mg/5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either loperamide hydrochloride capsules or loperamide hydrochloride oral solution may be used. For pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age, the following schedule for capsules or liquid will usually fulfill initial dosage requirements:

Recommended First Day Dosage Schedule

Two to five years (13 to 20 kg): 1 mg three times daily (3 mg total daily dosage)

Six to eight years (20 to 30 kg): 2 mg twice daily (4 mg total daily dosage)

Eight to twelve years (greater than 30 kg): 2 mg three times daily (6 mg total daily dosage)

Recommended Subsequent Daily Dosage

Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent loperamide hydrochloride doses (1 mg/10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool. The total daily dosage should not exceed recommended dosages for the first day.

### Changing gastrointestinal transit time alters microbiome composition and bile acid metabolism: a cross-over study in healthy volunteers [^116bXJXp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary and secondary fecal bile acids were significantly increased in delta senna compared to delta loperamide. This can be explained by a reduced gut transit time results in less reabsorption of bile acids and consequently, this leads to an elevated amount of de novo primary bile acid synthesis and thus secondary bile acid biotransformation. The end result is that larger quantities of primary and secondary bile acids are expelled and are detected in the stool samples as observed in our results. This rise in bile acids within the colon can initiate the onset of diarrhea, as these metabolites are known to stimulate fluid secretion and defecation urge. Interestingly, the primary to secondary bile acid ratio differed between delta loperamide and delta senna groups. Loperamide reduced the relative change in this ratio, suggesting increased secondary bile acid production. In contrast, senna increased the ratio and showed greater variability, indicating a more heterogeneous response in secondary bile acid metabolism. When WGTT is prolonged with loperamide, a lower proportion of primary to secondary bile acid transformation occurs compared to when gut transit is accelerated with senna. Furthermore, accelerating transit seems to have more of an effect on changing the bile acid pool than when it is slowed down with loperamide. A perturbed primary to secondary bile acid ratio has been used as a diagnostic marker for BAD. Future experiments could benefit from analyzing additional forms of bile acids, including isomers, alongside microbiota data to enhance understanding of bacterial metabolism.

### A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled phase II study of AGI004 for control of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea [^111ZkrdU]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Use of rescue medication

Overall, the use of loperamide as rescue medication by patients in the study was low, limiting the statistical analysis that could be performed on this data set. Given this, the overall usage of loperamide was less in the AGI004 arm than in the placebo arm at both the 4- and 8-mg dose levels with a greater trend observed at the 8-mg dose level (Table 4), specifically in the acute phase (day 1 of chemotherapy) where the difference in loperamide usage between the treatment arm and placebo was significant (0% and 12.5% (n = 4), respectively, P = 0.05). In the subset of patients with NCI grade 2 diarrhoea, the majority of patients used loperamide with the data suggesting a favourable response to AGI004 in comparison to placebo, again particularly at the 8-mg dose level, although any interpretation is limited by the small numbers of patients. Similarly, the percentage of days on chemotherapy where rescue medication was used was lower in the treatment arm than placebo, with a mean of 9.7% in the treatment arm and 13.6% in the placebo arm at the 4-mg dose level, and 5.6% and 8.8% at the 8-mg dose level for AGI004 and placebo, respectively. There was no other rescue medication used other than loperamide for the duration of the study.

Associated symptoms

A number of associated symptoms were also evaluated using information from the patients' daily diaries. Of these, a potential effect of AGI004 on the severity of diarrhoea scores per day of chemotherapy was suggested with a median score of 0.14 and 0.10 per day of chemotherapy for the AGI004 group at the 4- and 8-mg dose level, respectively, in comparison to median scores of 0.33 and 0.21 at the same dose levels for placebo. This difference reached statistical significance at the 8-mg dose level (P = 0.03).

Other associated GI symptoms of nausea, vomiting, constipation and abdominal pain or cramps occurred in a limited number of patients in both arms of the study, although no significant differences in these associated symptoms were observed between the two groups.

### Loperamide metabolite-induced cardiomyopathy and QTc prolongation [^114X6QLF]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter, peripherally acting, μ-opioid receptor agonist used for the treatment of diarrhea. In recent times users have found that at higher doses, loperamide crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches central μ-receptors in the brain, leading to central opiate effects including euphoria and respiratory depression. We report a case of a 37-year-old female who attempted suicide with over 200 loperamide tablets. During her overdose, her QTc was significantly prolonged at > 600ms. Our case aims to add to the growing body of literature describing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with loperamide toxicity and further suggests that a metabolite of loperamide, desmethylloperamide, may play a role in the pathogenesis.

### Brugada-type pattern on electrocardiogram associated with high-dose loperamide abuse [^1119McgH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Loperamide has been increasing in popularity recently for its effects separate from treatment of diarrhea. In large doses or in combination with other agents, it can lead to desirable effects in the central nervous system. However, cardiotoxicity has been reported with its abuse.

Case Report

A 49-year-old male who had been chronically abusing loperamide was found to have Brugada-like changes on his electrocardiogram (ECG). He had no other clinical symptoms associated with Brugada syndrome and did not have similar findings on previous ECGs. After abstaining from further loperamide use during hospitalization, this pattern slowly resolved without clinically significant dysrthymias. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? A patient with a history of loperamide abuse is at risk for cardiotoxicity. While other dysrhythmias are reported more commonly with loperamide abuse, Brugada-like ECG changes can occur and warrant appropriate consultation and prompt follow-up.

### Pathophysiology as a basis for understanding symptom complexes and therapeutic targets [^112LWBjK]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

Sensorimotor disorders of the stomach, small intestine and colon have a limited repertoire of clinical manifestations, and there is the potential for more than one mechanism to lead to symptoms. In many recent clinical trial programs of novel agents in neurogastroenterology, the emphasis has been primarily on symptom assessment of broad groups of patients identified by the Rome criteria. Drugs of potential value have fallen by the wayside with this approach. We propose the current paradigm is partly to blame; physiological testing should provide the basis for identifying more homogeneous populations and therapeutic targets within functional bowel disease, and this applies to the upper and lower gut. Here we summarize the evidence that certain biomarkers can, in a limited fashion, be used to predict the success of an experimental medicine in common disorders of gastrointestinal function, including the irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia. Although the current evidence is limited and is most convincingly demonstrated with examples of transit measurements (for loperamide, alosetron, tegaserod and piboserod), we perceive this paradigm that studies using validated and responsive biomarkers have an important role to play in drug development.

### Loperamide-associated opioid use disorder and proposal of an alternative treatment with buprenorphine [^115hxvR6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This case report describes a patient with opioid use disorder who developed cardiac toxicity secondary to non-medical use of loperamide. At recommended doses, loperamide remains in the periphery to treat diarrhea. At high doses, loperamide causes central nervous system (CNS) opioid agonism. Complications of high-dose loperamide have been documented, including cardiotoxicity, and death. This is particularly important in light of the ongoing opioid epidemic. This case presents a patient with sequela of high-dose loperamide as an illicit opioid replacement and the subsequent loperamide toxicity, including significant QTc prolongation. Abrupt cessation of his high-dose loperamide use resulted in opioid withdrawal symptoms, which were treated with buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was selected to avoid possible worsening of QTc secondary to an additional medication, such as methadone. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of buprenorphine for treatment of loperamide-associated opioid use disorder. Non-medical use of loperamide requires increased recognition by the health care community, including both physicians and pharmacists, because it can result in marked and life-threatening toxicity.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^11642hc8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Allergic Reactions

Extremely rare allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported.

Hepatic Impairment

The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of loperamide have not been studied. Use loperamide hydrochloride with caution in such patients because the systematic exposure to loperamide may be increased due to reduced metabolism. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment closely for signs of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity.

Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since it has been reported that the majority of the drug is metabolized and metabolites or the unchanged drug is excreted mainly in the feces, dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not required.

Geriatric Use

No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of loperamide in elderly subjects. However, in two studies that enrolled elderly patients, there were no major differences in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients.

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (see WARNINGS).

Information for Patients

Advise patients:

to take loperamide hydrochloride at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage is not recommended (see WARNINGS). Report to a healthcare facility if you or someone you are caring for taking loperamide hydrochloride experiences fainting episode, a rapid or irregular heartbeat or become unresponsive.
with acute diarrhea, that if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, discontinue loperamide hydrochloride and contact their healthcare provider.
to contact their healthcare provider if they see blood in their stools, or if they develop a fever or abdominal distention.
to use caution when driving a car or operating machinery, as tiredness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur in the setting of diarrheal syndromes treated with loperamide hydrochloride (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Abuse

A specific clinical study designed to assess the abuse potential of loperamide at high doses resulted in a finding of extremely low abuse potential.

Dependence

Studies in morphine-dependent monkeys demonstrated that loperamide hydrochloride at doses above those recommended for humans prevented signs of morphine withdrawal. However, in humans, the naloxone challenge pupil test, which when positive indicates opiate-like effects, performed after a single high dose, or after more than two years of therapeutic use of IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride), was negative. Orally administered IMODIUM® (loperamide formulated with magnesium stearate) is both highly insoluble and penetrates the CNS poorly.

### Racecadotril versus loperamide in acute radiation enteritis: a randomized, double-masked, phase 3, noninferiority trial [^112bapSJ]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is currently no gold standard for the management of acute radiation enteritis. We compared the efficacy and safety of Racecadotril, an anti-hypersecretory drug, versus Loperamide, an anti-motility agent, in acute radiation enteritis.

Methods and Materials

We conducted a randomized, double-masked, non-inferiority trial at a single research institute. Patients receiving curative radiation for pelvic malignancies, who developed grade 2 or 3 diarrhea (as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v 4.0) were included in the study. Patients in the intervention arm received Racecadotril and placebo. Patients in the control arm received Loperamide and placebo. The primary outcome was the resolution of diarrhea, 48 hours after the start of treatment.

Results

162 patients were randomized between 2019 and 2022. On intention-to-treat analysis, 68/81 patients, 84%, (95% CI, 74.1%-91.2%) in the Racecadotril arm and 70/81, 86.4%, (95% CI, 77.0%-93.0%) in the Loperamide arm improved from grade 2 or 3 diarrhea to grade 1 or 0, (P = 0.66, χ² test). The difference in proportion was 2.4% (95% CI: -8.5% to 13.4%). Since the upper boundary of the 95% CI crossed our non-inferiority margin of 10% (13.4%) we could not prove the non-inferiority of Racecadotril over Loperamide. Rebound constipation was more in the Loperamide arm compared to Racecadotril (17.3% vs 6.2%; P = 0.028) CONCLUSIONS: The non-inferiority of Racecadotril to Loperamide in acute radiation enteritis could not be demonstrated. However, Racecadotril can be the preferred drug of choice in acute radiation enteritis because Racecadotril does not affect bowel motility, achieved a high clinical success rate similar to that of Loperamide, and was associated with lesser side effects.

### Notes from the field: cardiac dysrhythmias after loperamide abuse-new york, 2008–2016 [^111BQtdi]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Loperamide is an over-the-counter antidiarrheal with opioid-receptor agonist properties. Recommended over-the-counter doses (range = 2–8 mg daily) do not produce opioid effects in the central nervous system because of poor oral bioavailability and P-glycoprotein efflux* of the medication (1); recent reports suggest that large doses (50–300 mg) of loperamide produce euphoria, central nervous system depression, and cardiotoxicity (2–4). Abuse of loperamide for its euphoric effect or for self-treatment of opioid withdrawal is increasing (5). Cases of loperamide abuse reported to the Upstate New York Poison Center and New York City Poison Control Center were analyzed for demographic, exposure, clinical, and laboratory characteristics. Cases of intentional loperamide abuse reported to the National Poison Database System (NPDS) also were analyzed for demographic, dose, formulation, and outcome information.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111KjobC]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardiasis — dosing recommendations for prevention and treatment in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children state that primary prophylaxis is antiretroviral therapy (ART) to avoid advanced immunodeficiency. For treatment, first-choice options are tinidazole, 50 mg/kg by mouth, administered as one dose given with food (maximum 2 g), and nitazoxanide with age-based dosing: 1–3 years: Nitazoxanide 100 mg by mouth every 12 hours with food for 3 days; 4–11 years: Nitazoxanide 200 mg by mouth every 12 hours with food for 3 days; ≥ 12 years: Nitazoxanide 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours with food for 3 days. An alternative is metronidazole 5 mg/kg by mouth every 8 hours for 5–7 days. Notes specify that recommendations are based on data from children who are HIV-negative. Tinidazole is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for children aged ≥ 3 years and is available in tablets that can be crushed, whereas metronidazole has a high frequency of GI side effects, a pediatric suspension is not commercially available but can be compounded from tablets, and metronidazole is not FDA-approved for the treatment of giardiasis. Supportive care includes hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, nutritional support, and that antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide) should be used with caution in young children.

### A case report of torsade de pointes and Brugada pattern associated with loperamide misuse and supratherapeutic loperamide concentrations [^115Bcjk8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Loperamide, commonly sold under the brand name Imodium® (Johnson & Johnson, Fort Washington, PA), is a widely available, over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication that possesses µ-opioid agonist properties and can have catastrophic cardiac events when misused or abused. Since the start of the opioid epidemic in the United States, there has been an increasing number of case reports and deaths linking loperamide abuse with cardiac events such as torsades de pointes (TdP) and Brugada syndrome.

Case Report

This case report presents a 22-year-old man who presented in cardiac arrest from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia consistent with TdP and a Type 1 Brugada pattern after intentional loperamide abuse. We discuss this patient's management and the proposed pathophysiology of these two cardiotoxicities, of which, to our knowledge, no previously published case report has displayed both in the same patient after a supratherapeutic loperamide ingestion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As the prevalence of opioid dependency and misuse has increased, so, too, has the misuse of un-scheduled medications such as loperamide to achieve central nervous system opioid effects. It is important for the emergency physician to know about and understand loperamide-associated cardiotoxicities such as prolongation of the QRS, unmasking of Brugada patterns, QT prolongation, or ventricular dysrhythmias such as TdP to be able to recognize and treat it.

### Loperamide-induced hypopituitarism [^113dmzgC]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well recognised that potent opioids, used either as analgesic medications or for illicit recreation, may produce dose-related hypopituitarism, including clinically significant hypoadrenalism and male hypogonadism. For illustration, 74% of community dwelling men taking strong opioids (≥ 20 mg morphine daily or equivalent) had a total serum testosterone concentration below the reference range in a previous study. Similarly, secondary adrenal failure has been frequently reported during both short-term and chronic opioid administration. Opioids act centrally to suppress the hypothalamic release of the hormones corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, leading to the downstream effects of hypoadrenalism and hypogonadism.

Although clinically manifest hypopituitarism in the setting of loperamide use has not been previously described, the effects of this drug on human HPA physiology were first reported in 1986 when it was found to inhibit plasma ACTH levels in a small number of patients with Addison's disease. 16 mg of oral loperamide induced a marked fall in ACTH levels that was detectable 1-hour postdose and persisted for several hours after administration, with a nadir at 300 min. Similar reductions in basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH have also been demonstrated in normal persons. Plasma levels of ACTH were markedly suppressed 3 hours after oral ingestion of 16 mg of loperamide, with both studies supporting a hypothalamic–pituitary mechanism for the effects observed in our patient.

While adrenal failure in the context of loperamide has not previously been reported, the overlapping chemical structure of this drug with opioids supports the mechanism of secondary adrenal failure seen here with high-dose loperamide.

Learning points

Adrenal failure secondary to hypopituitarism is a serious and hitherto unrecognised side effect of this very commonly used medication.
Critically, it was demonstrable in this patient while taking a quantity of loperamide just marginally higher than the maximum recommended dose.
Failure to recognise adrenal failure in this setting, where warning symptoms and signs (eg, hyponatraemia, hypotension) may overlap with either acute or chronic gastrointestinal disease, could have a disastrous impact.
Opioids, used more commonly at higher doses with significant systemic absorption than loperamide, can cause dose-related hypopituitarism and clinically significant adrenal failure.
It is imperative that clinicians exercise caution when relying on loperamide to manage their patients' chronic diarrhoea; we should be mindful of the possibility of drug-induced life-threatening adrenal insufficiency.

Clinical Trial Experience

The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of loperamide hydrochloride are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome. Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with loperamide hydrochloride were generally of a minor and self-limiting nature. They were more commonly observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea.

The adverse events reported are summarized irrespective of the causality assessment of the investigators.

1) Adverse events from 4 placebo-controlled studies in patients with acute diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: dry mouth, flatulence, abdominal cramp and colic.

2) Adverse events from 20 placebo-controlled studies in patients with chronic diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented below in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: nausea, vomiting, headache, meteorism, abdominal pain, abdominal cramp and colic.

3) Adverse events from seventy-six controlled and uncontrolled studies in patients with acute or chronic diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater in patients from all studies are given in the table below.

Dehydration

Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of loperamide hydrochloride does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy.

Gastrointestinal Disorders

In general, loperamide hydrochloride should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. Loperamide hydrochloride must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop.

Treatment of diarrhea with loperamide hydrochloride is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate (or when indicated).

Patients with AIDS treated with loperamide hydrochloride for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride.

Variability in Pediatric Response

Loperamide hydrochloride should be used with special caution in pediatric patients because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, may further influence the variability of response to loperamide hydrochloride. Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions.

OVERDOSAGE

The use of higher than recommended loperamide hydrochloride doses may result in life-threatening cardiac, CNS and respiratory adverse reactions.

If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

Cardiac Effects

 Symptoms

Cases of overdosage with loperamide hydrochloride (chronic ingestion of doses ranging from 70 mg to 1600 mg daily; 4 to 100 times the recommended dose) have resulted in life-threatening cardiac adverse reactions, including QT/QTc and QRS interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, Brugada syndrome and other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, cardiac arrest, and death. Cases include patients who were abusing (using supratherapeutic doses in place of opioids to induce euphoria) or misusing (taking higher than recommended doses to control diarrhea or to prevent opioid withdrawal) loperamide. The following are representative cases that included cardiac adverse reactions:

25 year old abused loperamide and presented to the hospital on multiple occasions with symptoms of syncope, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotensive shock. The patient also experienced ventricular tachycardia, a prolonged QTc of 527 ms and QRS interval of 170 ms, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and subsequent cardiac arrest and death (elevated loperamide blood concentration of 32 ng/ml).
54 year old misused loperamide hydrochloride (up to 144 mg per day) as a self-treatment for chronic diarrhea for over 2 years. Signs of cardiac toxicity included syncope, prolonged QT of 500 ms sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which required cardioversion and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) management.
26 year old, with prior opioid abuse, presented to the hospital with recurrent syncope and developed Torsades de Pointes requiring electrical cardioversion. An ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 85 bpm and a markedly prolonged QTc interval of greater than 700 ms. The patient reported ingesting 100 to 250 mg of loperamide hydrochloride with 400 mg of cimetidine daily for several months to simulate the euphoric sensation associated with opioids.

### Topical loperamide for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain: a case report and literature review [^113a8hzP]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Results from one animal study indicate that loperamide creams with the concentration of 0.5%, 1.7% and 5% had a dose-dependent anti-hyperalgesic effect in a thermal injury rat model. In a second animal study, using a full-thickness burn rat model, topical loperamide 5% significantly increased mechanical thresholds, prevented sensitization of uninjured skin and reduced burn-induced ectopic discharge of the recorded nociceptive fibers. The mechanism of action of topical loperamide in peripheral neuropathic pain is most probably by influencing MORs at the nerve endings of the nociceptors, and perhaps additionally, on other structures in the epidermis (for example, keratinocytes and immune-competent cells). In several neuropathic pain models, an enhanced expression of opioid receptors has been documented at the nerve lesion site and in paw skin. Our postulation is that topical loperamide acts on MORs at nociceptors in the skin and other cell-populations such as keratinocytes and immune-competent cells. Topical loperamide 5% formulation might be a new useful addition as a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of therapy-resistant LNP. The optimal concentration of loperamide cream will have to be elucidated in N-of-1 studies and/or dose-finding studies.

Conclusion

In our case report, loperamide 5% cream proved effective in reducing intractable neuropathic pain which did not respond to systemic analgesics and other trials of topical agents. Clinicians facing patients with intractable LNP, not responding on oral analgesics or common compounded topical analgesics, can broaden their armamentarium with topical loperamide. The use of SIBRET in symmetrical polyneuropathy to determine true responders on topical loperamide can be very helpful. Well-designed double-blinded randomized controlled trials will further elucidate the role of topical loperamide as an option for the management of LNP.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^116vwn1q]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Assess patients for opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, using shared decision making, regardless of a patient's plan to disrupt opioid use or continue treatment after discharge.
When patients prefer methadone titrate it appropriately (Table 1) recognizing that dosing guidelines may not reflect patient needs in the setting of potent opioids (e.g. fentanyl).
Offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) in addition to opioid agonist therapy to mitigate opioid withdrawal symptoms.
Link patients who want to continue methadone to local OTPs on discharge. If there is no accessible OTP, discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to methadone.
Prescribe naloxone and discuss harm reduction as part of overdose prevention.

Ancillary management — antimotility, antinausea, and antiemetic agents: Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate); loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). An antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate). During acute gastroenteritis, more children receiving ondansetron, compared with placebo, had resolution of vomiting and ondansetron reduced the immediate need for hospitalization or intravenous rehydration; however, ondansetron did not decrease hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge and diarrhea was reported as a side effect. A recommendation cannot be made for the routine use of antiemetic agents for acute gastroenteritis in children < 4 years of age or in adults; bismuth subsalicylate is mildly effective, and racecadotril reduces stool volume but is not available in North America.
