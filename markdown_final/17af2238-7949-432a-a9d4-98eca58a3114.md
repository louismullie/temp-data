## Question

Anaphylaxis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat anaphylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate recognition and when to call anaphylaxis. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and dosing, including route and repetition. Next, I will review adjuncts like fluids, oxygen, and beta-agonists, and I need to check the evolving stance on antihistamines and corticosteroids. After that, I should consider refractory anaphylaxis and escalation. I will then examine special populations and settings, including pediatrics, pregnancy, perioperative care, and community management. Finally, I need to ensure documentation, observation, and follow-up plans are addressed, and I will close with a concise algorithm that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold and the principle of early treatment, because delays in epinephrine are consistently linked to worse outcomes; anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis based on rapid-onset multisystem involvement or hypotension, and I should not wait for labs before treating, even if the presentation is atypical or evolving, as early intramuscular epinephrine is the cornerstone of care and delays increase morbidity and mortality [^114hR26J] [^117QTakN] [^112kfMHy].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line therapy details before moving on; intramuscular epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.5 mg in adults) into the anterolateral thigh is recommended, and if symptoms persist or progress, repeat every 5–15 minutes, with most patients requiring only one dose but a meaningful minority needing more, which is why carrying two autoinjectors is advised in at-risk individuals [^114aTMaW] [^114iYA6G] [^115UadCc].

> Hold on, I should verify the route and device considerations; the IM route achieves faster and more reliable absorption than subcutaneous, and IV bolus is not recommended for initial treatment outside specialized settings due to dosing errors and arrhythmias, though IV infusion is appropriate for refractory cases or perioperative settings with expert monitoring, and autoinjectors remain the practical community standard despite fixed-dose limitations that may necessitate a second dose in some patients [^114MhG3L] [^116QyUKi] [^1167WF1M].

> I need to check the role of adjuncts carefully; high-flow oxygen for respiratory distress, early isotonic IV fluids for distributive shock, and inhaled beta-agonists for persistent wheeze are reasonable, but they must not delay epinephrine, and I should remember that beta-agonists treat lower airway symptoms only and do not address upper airway edema or hypotension, so they are adjuncts after epinephrine, not substitutes [^111dosrc] [^1157MQJ9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antihistamines and corticosteroids were standard second-line treatments, but I should double-check the current stance; recent guideline updates de-emphasize both, recommending against routine antihistamines acutely because they do not treat airway or circulatory compromise and may distract from epinephrine, and suggesting against routine corticosteroids given lack of benefit for preventing biphasic reactions and possible harm signals in observational data, reserving them for select scenarios like refractory reactions or significant asthma comorbidity [^1151Em7g] [^115CLcmy] [^113L6H18].

> Let me consider refractory anaphylaxis next; if there is no adequate response after two appropriate IM doses plus fluids, I should escalate to an IV epinephrine infusion with continuous monitoring, involve critical care early, and consider second-line vasopressors such as norepinephrine or vasopressin when shock persists, recognizing that evidence is limited and choices should be individualized with expert oversight [^111cNTT7] [^112iqt9b] [^116QyUKi].

> I should confirm special populations and settings; in children, weight-based IM dosing is standard and many centers transition to 0.3 mg when weight exceeds about 20–25 kg, in pregnancy the same IM dosing applies with left lateral positioning if hypotensive, in perioperative settings trained teams may use IV epinephrine early due to impaired IM absorption, and in the community, education on prompt self-injection and access to two autoinjectors are essential, with emerging non-injectable options like intranasal epinephrine offering promise but still requiring training and integration into action plans [^114aTMaW] [^116QyUKi] [^1167WF1M].

> Hold on, I should verify observation and disposition; observation duration should be risk-stratified, with many adults observed 6–12 hours and some patients with severe features or unclear triggers warranting longer monitoring, and all patients should leave with at least two autoinjectors, a written emergency action plan, trigger avoidance counseling, and referral to allergy for evaluation and, where appropriate, immunotherapy, as structured follow-up reduces recurrence risk and improves preparedness [^113sw2WG] [^115UadCc] [^1175ZZZN].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency; recognize anaphylaxis clinically and do not delay, give IM epinephrine immediately, repeat every 5–15 minutes if needed, provide oxygen and fluids early, add inhaled beta-agonist for wheeze, avoid letting antihistamines or corticosteroids delay epinephrine, escalate to IV epinephrine infusion and vasopressors for refractory cases, tailor care for pediatrics, pregnancy, and perioperative settings, and ensure robust discharge planning with education and allergy follow-up, aligning with contemporary international guidelines and evidence syntheses [^114yXqEr] [^117XYJsf] [^114hR26J].

---

Epinephrine is the **first-line treatment** for anaphylaxis [^114hR26J] and should be given **immediately** [^113sHx2Q] as an intramuscular injection into the anterolateral thigh [^114yXqEr] at 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.5 mg) [^114aTMaW]. If symptoms persist, repeat every 5–15 minutes [^114aTMaW]. Early use reverses airway obstruction, hypotension, and shock [^114iYA6G]; delays increase risk of biphasic reactions and mortality [^111TYwtq]. There are **no absolute contraindications** in anaphylaxis [^116q3NRv]. Adjuncts (oxygen, IV fluids, beta-agonists) are supportive only and must not delay epinephrine [^116gpKqk]. Patients should be observed 4–8 hours after a single dose, and 12–24 hours after severe or biphasic reactions [^116K3kga].

---

## Indications for epinephrine administration

Epinephrine is indicated for **anaphylaxis**, defined by rapid-onset, life-threatening respiratory and/or cardiovascular compromise, with or without skin symptoms [^117QTakN]. It is the **first-line treatment** for anaphylaxis of any cause, including food, drugs, insect stings, and idiopathic reactions [^113RE9t1].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Dosage**: 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.5 mg) IM into the anterolateral thigh (vastus lateralis) [^114aTMaW].
- **Autoinjectors**: 0.15 mg for 10–25 kg; 0.3 mg for ≥ 25 kg; 0.5 mg for adults (some regions) [^114dJyGz].
- **Repeat dosing**: every 5–15 minutes if symptoms persist or progress [^114aTMaW].
- **Route**: IM preferred; IV/IO reserved for refractory cases or cardiac arrest with expert oversight [^114MhG3L].

---

## Timing of administration

Early epinephrine is critical; administer **immediately** upon recognition of anaphylaxis [^113beyxM]. Delays are associated with increased risk of biphasic reactions, ICU admission, and mortality [^notfound].

---

## Clinical effects of epinephrine

Epinephrine rapidly reverses anaphylaxis via **alpha-1 vasoconstriction** (restores perfusion), **beta-1 inotropy/chronotropy** (supports cardiac output), and **beta-2 bronchodilation** (relieves airway obstruction). It also inhibits further mediator release from mast cells and basophils [^114iYA6G].

---

## Safety profile and contraindications

IM epinephrine is **safe**; transient effects (pallor, tremor, palpitations, anxiety) are common but benign [^114iYA6G]. There are **no absolute contraindications** in anaphylaxis; use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or pregnancy, but do not withhold [^116q3NRv].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjuncts are supportive and must not delay epinephrine:

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Oxygen | Respiratory distress, hypoxemia | After epinephrine |
| IV fluids | Hypotension, shock | After epinephrine |
| Beta-agonists | Persistent bronchospasm | After epinephrine |
| Antihistamines | Cutaneous symptoms only | After epinephrine |
| Corticosteroids | Refractory cases, asthma | After epinephrine |

---

## Monitoring and observation

Observe all patients after epinephrine for **biphasic reactions** [^116K3kga]. Typical observation is 4–8 hours after a single dose, and 12–24 hours after severe or biphasic reactions [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatrics**: IM epinephrine is first-line; dosing by weight; autoinjectors available in pediatric doses [^1167RcDR].
- **Pregnancy**: IM epinephrine is safe and recommended; left lateral positioning if hypotensive.
- **Perioperative**: IV epinephrine may be used by trained teams when IM is impractical [^116QyUKi].

---

## Patient education and preparedness

Patients at risk should carry **two epinephrine autoinjectors** [^115UadCc] and be trained in their use [^1157MQJ9]. Written action plans and education on recognition and prompt injection improve outcomes [^1175ZZZN].

---

Epinephrine is the **cornerstone of anaphylaxis care**; administer it **immediately**, repeat as needed, and use adjuncts only after epinephrine. Early treatment prevents progression, reduces complications, and saves lives [^116q3NRv].

## References

### Is epinephrine truly lifesaving, and can we prove this? [^116pa23r]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Injectable intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is touted as "life-saving", in particular because observational studies have identified lack of prompt epinephrine treatment as a critical risk factor associated with anaphylaxis fatality. Although association is not causal, few would argue that epinephrine is not the optimal treatment for anaphylaxis, and do we have sufficient proof to suggest that epinephrine is actually "life-saving"? Epinephrine indeed works swiftly to reverse such symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. However, there are abundant observational data that many cases of anaphylaxis are inherently self-limited and may resolve within 1 to 2 hours in most cases with or without treatment. In this perspective, the intent is to address and reframe the reality of the evidence we do have for what epinephrine does and does not accomplish and provide a perspective regarding the common "dogma" regarding the drug. There is a danger in using terms such as "life-threatening" and "life-saving" for anaphylaxis and epinephrine treatment, especially under the caution of frequently cited rhetoric that subsequent reactions are likely to be progressively more severe or potentially fatal. Use of such descriptions risks negatively polarizing our patients and adversely affecting their quality of life, given these terms can potentiate unnecessary fear. Epinephrine is in fact a wonderful drug, but it is important to not lose sight of the evidence for what it actually does in anaphylaxis treatment and why it is important to use this drug in anaphylaxis, as opposed to an emphasis on what it does not do.

Epinephrine use and diagnosis — epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and meeting diagnostic criteria is not required before use because there are scenarios in which epinephrine may be warranted before a reaction is diagnosed as anaphylaxis; however, a lack of clinical response to epinephrine should not be used as a surrogate marker to establish a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115UadCc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine is established as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The majority of allergic reactions occur in the community. Delayed administration of epinephrine has been associated with poor outcomes in anaphylaxis. To mitigate against this, patients at risk of anaphylaxis to food and insect stings are often prescribed epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) for self-administration.

National and international regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, and the European Medicines Agency recommend that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis carry at least 2 EAIs at all times. This is in contrast to guidelines from some specialist societies, which make this recommendation for only selected "at-risk" patients. This divergence in advice is potentially problematic for clinicians, who might be faced with medicolegal consequences if they go against official recommendations from regulatory authorities and prescribe only a single EAI device.

A number of observational studies have assessed the frequency of anaphylaxis reactions that fail to adequately respond to a single dose of epinephrine. However, the data are limited by the studies' small sample sizes and differences in local practice in defining and treating anaphylaxis and heterogeneity in study design. As a result, estimates for the rate of allergic reactions treated with more than a single dose of epinephrine vary widely, ranging from 0%to 32%. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the proportion of anaphylaxis reactions reported in the literature that were treated with at least 2 doses of epinephrine.

### Anaphylaxis pathogenesis and treatment [^111TYwtq]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and sometimes leads to death. Understanding mechanisms, triggers, and patient-specific risk factors for severe or fatal anaphylaxis is critically important. Diagnosis of anaphylaxis is currently based on established clinical criteria. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line medication for anaphylaxis treatment and delay in injecting it contributes to biphasic reactions, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and fatality. Here, we focus on four important areas of translational research in anaphylaxis: studies of potential new biomarkers to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, laboratory tests to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical risk of anaphylaxis, the primary role of epinephrine (adrenaline) in anaphylaxis treatment, and strengthening the overall evidence base for anaphylaxis treatment.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^117QTakN]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Allergy Organisation (WAO) defines anaphylaxis as "a serious systemic hypersensitivity reaction that is usually rapid in onset and may cause death. Severe anaphylaxis is characterized by potentially life-threatening compromise in airway, breathing and/or the circulation, and may occur without typical skin features or circulatory shock being present". Anaphylaxis thus lies along a spectrum of severity, ranging from mild objective breathing problems (such as mild wheezing) to circulatory "shock" and/or collapse ("anaphylactic shock"). The estimated incidence for anaphylaxis in Europe is 1.5 to 7.9 per 100,000 person-years, with a lifetime prevalence of 1 in 300. International guidelines concur that the first line treatment of anaphylaxis is intramuscular (IM) adrenaline, but there is increasing divergence between published guidelines. This may be due to a lack of high-certainty evidence to support treatment recommendations. Given the difficulties of undertaking randomised controlled trials in the management of a potentially life-threatening condition, guidelines must therefore be based on the best available research evidence, theory and expert consensus.

### Adrenaline for the treatment of anaphylaxis: cochrane systematic review [^1114ru49]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adrenaline is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for anaphylaxis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of adrenaline in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1966 to March 2007), CINAHL (1982 to March 2007), BIOSIS (to March 2007), ISI Web of Knowledge (to March 2007) and LILACS (to March 2007). We also searched websites listing ongoing trials: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlledtrials.com and http://www.actr.org.au/ and contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing adrenaline with no intervention, placebo or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

On the basis of this review, we are unable to make any new recommendations on the use of adrenaline for the treatment of anaphylaxis. In the absence of appropriate trials, we recommend, albeit on the basis of less than optimal evidence, that adrenaline administration by intramuscular injection should still be regarded as first-line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis.

### Availability of stock epinephrine in schools is needed to address health disparities in anaphylaxis [^111MUwxG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with early administration being an important goal. Increasing the availability of unassigned stock EAIs in schools is an important strategy to improve access for all children, and broad implementation may help reduce the striking health disparities seen in anaphylaxis outcomes. This case report is an example of how physicians can use case examples in their advocacy efforts to influence policies affecting communities.

### Anaphylaxis: guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^1157MQJ9]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and all healthcare professionals should be familiar with its recognition and acute and ongoing management. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Taskforce on Anaphylaxis. They aim to provide evidence-based recommendations for the recognition, risk factor assessment, and the management of patients who are at risk of, are experiencing, or have experienced anaphylaxis. While the primary audience is allergists, these guidelines are also relevant to all other healthcare professionals. The development of these guidelines has been underpinned by two systematic reviews of the literature, both on the epidemiology and on clinical management of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition whose clinical diagnosis is based on recognition of a constellation of presenting features. First-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular adrenaline. Useful second-line interventions may include removing the trigger where possible, calling for help, correct positioning of the patient, high-flow oxygen, intravenous fluids, inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, and nebulized adrenaline. Discharge arrangements should involve an assessment of the risk of further reactions, a management plan with an anaphylaxis emergency action plan, and, where appropriate, prescribing an adrenaline auto-injector. If an adrenaline auto-injector is prescribed, education on when and how to use the device should be provided. Specialist follow-up is essential to investigate possible triggers, to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, and to prevent future episodes by developing personalized risk reduction strategies including, where possible, commencing allergen immunotherapy. Training for the patient and all caregivers is essential. There are still many gaps in the evidence base for anaphylaxis.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^114P2aPa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis in food allergy — Use epinephrine as first-line management for the treatment of anaphylaxis [Strength of recommendation: Strong; C Evidence], and ensure that self-injectable epinephrine is readily available with instruction on its use [Strength of recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. Intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment in all cases of anaphylaxis, and repeat epinephrine dosing should be used when symptoms progress or response is suboptimal.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^115Qk24u]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) — risk‑stratified prescribing and context: Epinephrine is universally recommended as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, yet the rate of EAI prescription for patients at risk of anaphylaxis remains suboptimal. Recommendation 23 (CBS): We suggest clinicians routinely prescribe EAls to patients at higher risk of anaphylaxis. When deciding whether to prescribe EAls to lower risk patients, we suggest that clinicians engage in a shared decision-making process that considers the patients' risk factors, values, and preferences. Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Very Low. Allergic reactions range in severity from mild skin manifestations to life-threatening anaphylaxis, and there are risk factors that significantly increase the relative risk of anaphylaxis, although the absolute risk may remain small. For patients with food allergy, even small amounts of causative allergen may potentially trigger an allergic reaction — including anaphylaxis in some cases, and for some, EAI prescriptions are linked to improved quality of life; however, virtually all clinical trials report some severe allergic reactions.

Interpretation of strong and weak recommendations.

The guidelines reviewed were those from: British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology (BSACI); National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI); Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA); Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI); Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI); World Allergy Organisation (WAO). The EAACI 2021 updated guideline and JTFPP 2020 documents followed the GRADE EtD framework. Systematic reviews of anaphylaxis treatment (including both randomised controlled trials and observational studies) published in the last 10 years were identified by searching PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Is adrenaline effective for the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Recommendation

We recommend adrenaline as the first line treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)

(adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines)

Rationale

International guidelines agree that adrenaline (epinephrine) is first line treatment for anaphylaxis. However, supporting evidence is limited to observational studies (case series and fatality registers) in humans, animal models, epidemiological studies, and pharmacokinetic studies in patients who might be at risk for anaphylaxis but not experiencing allergic symptoms at the time of study. The EAACI 2014 guideline concluded "there is some evidence to support the use of adrenaline for the emergency management of anaphylaxis", while the WAO 2011 Guideline noted that "the evidence base for prompt epinephrine injection in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis is stronger than the evidence base for the use of antihistamines and glucocorticoids in anaphylaxis". A systematic review by EAACI in 2020 only identified observational studies examining the efficacy of adrenaline and noted a high risk of bias; no eligible studies compared adrenaline with no adrenaline for critical outcomes such as mortality, or most other outcomes.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^111vs4DQ]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In general, the certainty of evidence underpinning anaphylaxis management is low or very low. The GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process provides a robust and transparent mechanism to assess the current evidence for treatment of anaphylaxis, to inform the 2021 RCUK Anaphylaxis Guideline update. A strength of this approach is that it should reduce discordance between different guidelines, and highlight the reasons for any discrepancies. Through a public consultation, we were able to include responses from key stakeholders, ensuring that our recommendations considered the values and preferences of clinicians, patients and carers. We have previously commented "anaphylaxis is anaphylaxis, irrespective of where it occurs: it does not vary in presentation or response to treatment depending on country or region". As a community, we need to "achieve an international consensus on what we do know, and transparency over those areas for which (at best) there is limited evidence and at worst, emerging data that such interventions may do harm". We hope this evidence review serves as an initial step in this process.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^1175hJLV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction, which constitutes a clinical emergency. Common misconceptions regarding anaphylaxis are summarised in table 2. Prompt assessment and management are essential, as delays in treatment are associated with fatal outcomes. Anaphylaxis is primarily a clinical diagnosis: patients/carers and health professionals must be appropriately trained to recognise and institute appropriate treatment with intramuscular epinephrine, as part of a comprehensive management plan. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, but is underused. Changes in posture have been documented as a trigger for decompensation and fatal anaphylaxis. New management plans incorporating this advice, and which allow the use of 'spare' autoinjectors in schools, are available from the BSACI and viawebsite.

### Customizing anaphylaxis guidelines for emergency medicine [^1149qyZd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Most episodes of anaphylaxis are managed in emergency medical settings, where the cardinal signs and symptoms often differ from those observed in the allergy clinic. Data suggest that low recognition of anaphylaxis in the emergency setting may relate to inaccurate coding and lack of a standard, practical definition.

Objective

Develop a simple, consistent definition of anaphylaxis for emergency medicine providers, supported by clinically relevant consensus statements.

Discussion

Definitions of anaphylaxis and criteria for diagnosis from current anaphylaxis guidelines were reviewed with regard to their utilization in emergency medical settings. The agreed-upon working definition is: Anaphylaxis is a serious reaction causing a combination of characteristic findings, and which is rapid in onset and may cause death. It is usually due to an allergic reaction but can be non-allergic. The definition is supported by Consensus Statements, each with referenced discussion. For a positive outcome, quick diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis are critical. However, even in the emergency setting, the patient may not present with life-threatening symptoms. Because mild initial symptoms can quickly progress to a severe, even fatal, reaction, the first-line treatment for any anaphylaxis episode — regardless of severity — is intramuscular injection of epinephrine into the anterolateral thigh; delaying its administration increases the potential for morbidity and mortality. When a reaction appears as "possible anaphylaxis", it is generally better to err on the side of caution and administer epinephrine.

Conclusion

We believe that this working definition and the supporting Consensus Statements are a first step to better management of anaphylaxis in the emergency medical setting.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^114iYA6G]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute management

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis according to all guidelines. It has both α-sympathomimetic and β-sympathomimetic actions, causing peripheral vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output and bronchodilation; importantly, it is the only drug that inhibits the further release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils.

Myth 4: 'Epinephrine is dangerous'

Epinephrine given by intramuscular injection into the outer mid-thigh is very safe and starts to work within minutes. Epinephrine can either be injected using a needle–syringe (using 1:1000 epinephrine, which results in a lower volume, less painful injection than if using 1:10 000) or by autoinjector device (eg, Emerade, EpiPen, Jext). Where an autoinjector is used, note that both EpiPen and Jext are only available in 150 µg and 300 µg doses, which means that the 300 µg is effectively an underdose in someone over 30 kg (this may explain why some patients require a second epinephrine dose). Younger children should be transitioned to a 300 µg dose when their body weight is > 25 kg, and some centres advocate doing so from 20 kg. Around 10%–20% of patients report transient effects including pallor, anxiety, palpitations, dizziness and headache (although these symptoms may also be due to the reaction and/or the patient's own endogenous epinephrine production).

Epinephrine is underused in the treatment of anaphylaxis, both prehospital and in emergency departments. Further intramuscular doses of epinephrine should be administered in the event of persisting respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. Epinephrine can and should be repeated after 5 min; the administration of other medication such as antihistamines or steroids must not cause delay or distraction, as these are not first-line (or even second-line) treatments for anaphylaxis(figure 2A). An alternative summary of anaphylaxis treatment, consistent with national and international guidelines, is shown in figure 2B.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^114DcQUN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings. However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage. These include variations in prescribing EAI, what symptoms should prompt epinephrine administration, whether emergency medical services (EMS) need to be contacted after administration, and whether epinephrine administered via EAI reduces mortality from anaphylaxis or improves quality of life measures. We provide a balanced commentary on these issues. There is increasing recognition that a poor response to epinephrine, particularly after 2 doses, is a useful marker of severity and the need for urgent escalation. It is likely that patients who respond to a single epinephrine dose do not require EMS activation or emergency department transfer, but data are needed to demonstrate the safety of this approach. Lastly, patients at risk of anaphylaxis must be counseled against over-reliance on EAI alone.

### Epinephrine autoinjectors: new data, new Problems [^117NXyZ2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Despite this, there have been identified gaps in the management of anaphylaxis including infrequent or delayed use of epinephrine for acute allergic reactions, as well as inadequate epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) training, and prescription rates of these devices for patients at risk. This paper reviews new data, and new problems in recently published literature on EAIs. A database search was conducted for publications between January 2015 and February 2017 using keywords related to EAIs including their functionality and features, carriage, prescription rates, barriers, and side effects. Eligibility criteria included patients at risk for anaphylaxis, caregivers, and health care professionals. Experimental studies and observational studies were included. Of 1,737 potentially relevant articles, 19 were used for analysis. These articles addressed specific aspects of an EAI, including (1) information on features and functionality; (2) prescriptions; (3) training on their use; and (4) carriage and use at the time of reaction by patients, schools, camps, emergency departments, and paramedics. Our review highlights that existing gaps in anaphylaxis management remain unaddressed. Patient needs are largely unmet, and very few studies are being designed to clarify and instill best practice, and to determine how to increase adherence to existing anaphylaxis guidelines through integrated knowledge translation strategies.

We also searched websites listing ongoing trials: http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlledtrials.com and http://www.actr.org.au/; and contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing adrenaline with no intervention, placebo or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Main Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review, we are unable to make any new recommendations on the use of adrenaline for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although there is a need for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality in order to define the true extent of benefits from the administration of adrenaline in anaphylaxis, such trials are unlikely to be performed in individuals with anaphylaxis. Indeed, they might be unethical because prompt treatment with adrenaline is deemed to be critically important for survival in anaphylaxis. Also, such studies would be difficult to conduct because anaphylactic episodes usually occur without warning, often in a non-medical setting, and differ in severity both among individuals and from one episode to another in the same individual. Consequently, obtaining baseline measurements and frequent timed measurements might be difficult, or impossible, to obtain. In the absence of appropriate trials, we recommend, albeit on the basis of less than optimal evidence, that adrenaline administration by intramuscular (i.m.) injection should still be regarded as first-line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^116K3kga]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Are inhaled beta-2 agonists effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendation

1 Beta-2 agonists (such as salbutamol) may be useful as an adjunct treatment for lower respiratory symptoms caused by anaphylaxis, following initial treatment with IM adrenaline (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 In the presence of persisting respiratory symptoms in anaphylaxis, beta-2 agonists (whether inhaled or parenteral) should not be used as an alternative to further parenteral treatment with adrenaline (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008, WAO 2011/2020, EAACI 2014 and ASCIA 2020 guidelines, with greater emphasis on using bronchodilators as an adjunct rather than a replacement for adrenaline)

Rationale

Beta-2 agonists are widely used in clinical practice and feature in most guidelines as a second-line treatment option for anaphylaxis. There is limited evidence to support the use of inhaled beta-2 agonists in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and evidence is extrapolated from their use to treat acute asthma. International guidelines agree that bronchodilators may be helpful for persisting wheeze, but caution that they do not prevent or relieve upper airway obstruction, hypotension or shock, and should therefore be used as adjunct treatments.,

In patients with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, beta-2 agonists can be administered by repeated activations of a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) via an appropriate large volume spacer where the patient does not require supplementary oxygen. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation over the use of MDIs with spacers in acute severe or life-threatening respiratory symptoms; in these patients, beta-2 agonists should be administered by oxygen-driven nebuliser. There are anecdotal reports of anaphylaxis initially misdiagnosed as severe asthma, which did not respond to parenteral bronchodilator therapy but did respond to adrenaline. For this reason, parenteral beta-2 agonists (such as intravenous salbutamol) must not be used in preference to adrenaline for acute anaphylaxis. This recommendation is made on the basis of adrenaline (including further doses) being established as the first-line treatment of anaphylaxis.

How long should patients be observed in hospital following anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendation

We suggest a risk-stratified approach to the discharge of patients following anaphylaxis (Table 5) (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

### Epinephrine in severe allergic reactions: the European anaphylaxis register [^115xvNFW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend intramuscular administration of epinephrine as the first-line drug for the emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), but no randomized trial evidence supports this consensus.

Objective

We aimed to assess anaphylaxis treatment practices over 10 years, covering several European regions, all allergen sources, and all age groups.

Methods

The European Anaphylaxis Register tracks elicitors, symptoms, emergency treatment, diagnostic workups, and long-term counseling for anaphylaxis incidents through web-based data entry from tertiary allergy specialists, covering information from the emergency respondent, patient, tertiary referral, and laboratory/clinical test results.

Results

We analyzed 10,184 anaphylaxis incidents. In total, 27.1% of patients treated by a health professional received epinephrine and, in total, 10.5% received a second dose. Successful administration was less frequent in German-speaking countries (minimum 19.6%) than in Greece, France, and Spain (maximum 66.7%). Over the last decade, epinephrine administration from a health professional almost doubled to reach 30.6% in 2015–2017, half of which was applied intramuscularly. A total of 14.7% of lay- or self-treated cases were treated with an autoinjector. Of those without treatment, 22.4% carried a device for administration. No change in successful administration by lay emergency respondents was found over the last 10 years. Of the reaction and patient characteristics analyzed, only clinical severity considerably influenced the likelihood of receiving epinephrine, with 66.9% of successful administrations in near-fatal (grade IV) reactions.

Conclusions

Despite clear recommendations, only a small proportion of anaphylaxis incidents are treated with epinephrine. We demonstrated a slight increase in treated patients when handled by professionals, but stagnation in lay- or self-treated anaphylaxis. The reaction circumstances, the respondent's professional background, and patient characteristics did not explain which reactions were treated.

### Patient communications: why is It important to quickly use epinephrine at the onset of symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis? [^112kfMHy]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Delayed administration of epinephrine (adrenaline), the first-line and only effective treatment of a systemic allergic reaction (SAR) and anaphylaxis, is associated with increased mortality. However, epinephrine is underused because of a lack of consensus as to when it should be administered and an inappropriate fear of using epinephrine and potential adverse effects from the medication. The authors emphasize that SARs and anaphylaxis should be considered as a spectrum, and that affected individuals be educated on its safety and repeatedly given instructions as to when and how epinephrine should be used at the first symptoms or signs of SAR and anaphylaxis.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^116uWQAG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. – The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings. However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage — something that is not surprising given the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the treatment of acute allergic reactions. There is reasonable evidence from observational studies to support the use of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis. Indeed, one might consider this scenario to be analogous to the absence of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of parachutes in reducing mortality from "gravitational challenge". However, there is an important difference: in the absence of a parachute, high-altitude falls are almost certain to result in death. In contrast, data from cohort studies including large patient registries indicate that in at least 80% of anaphylaxis events, the allergic reaction resolves despite nonuse of epinephrine. We do not want individuals at risk of anaphylaxis to attempt a version of "Russian roulette", and we cannot condone the nonuse of epinephrine when anaphylaxis occurs. At the same time, there is a need for safe, cost-effective, and evidence-based strategies to optimize patient outcomes and ensure appropriate health care utilization and resource allocation. We provide a balanced commentary on EAI prescription and usage to stimulate discussion about optimal clinical care of individuals at risk of anaphylaxis.

### Recognition and first-line treatment of anaphylaxis [^116FQgPz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 included a code only for anaphylactic shock. The improved ICD-10 coding defines the different symptoms and types of anaphylaxis and includes coding for anaphylaxis without shock. This new coding is consistent with the efforts of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), who convened a panel to formulate a definition of and the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a serious reaction that has a rapid onset and may cause death. It is a systemic immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction resulting from the sudden release of multiple mediators from mast cells and basophils. Foods are the most common triggers for anaphylactic reactions, followed by drugs, insect stings, and idiopathic anaphylaxis (anaphylaxis of unknown cause). If the NIAID/FAAN criteria are met and anaphylaxis is diagnosed, epinephrine administration is mandatory. Delays in epinephrine administration have been associated with fatalities. Patients should have ready access to > 1 epinephrine autoinjector in the outpatient setting. An individualized emergency action plan should be developed for each patient at risk for anaphylaxis.

Several biologic therapies and new devices are emerging as potential preventive treatment of anaphylaxis. However, adrenaline (epinephrine) is still the first-line treatment of any type of anaphylaxis. Biologic drugs, such as omalizumab, although not US Food and Drug Administration approved for anaphylaxis, have been used as therapeutic adjuvants in the preventive treatment of anaphylaxis, but cost-effectiveness should be considered individually.

Table I
Amended criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, proposed by the World Allergy Organization Anaphylaxis Committee, 2019

Although largely a clinical diagnosis, biomarkers and specifically serum tryptase may support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis and aid in differentiating anaphylaxis from its mimics such as idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome and severe asthma, although serum tryptase level is also elevated in fatal asthma. This can be important in the context of monitoring trends for more severe reactions. Yet despite its recommendation in current guidelines, the role of tryptase in "real-world" practice remains debated. From a practical standpoint, serum tryptase is not readily available to emergency providers because it often takes several days for results to become available. Moreover, although the positive predictive value of serum tryptase is high (93%), the negative predictive value is low (17%)and may not be helpful, particularly for food-induced anaphylaxis when tryptase level is frequently not elevated. Other biomarkers (such as platelet-activating factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes, chemokine ligand-2) have been proposedbut can be difficult to measure even under laboratory conditions. Future studies may need to consider examining the sensitivity and specificity of a combination of biomarkers.

With regard to anaphylaxis management, although epinephrine remains the first-line treatment, glucocorticoids and antihistamines including both H1- and H2-antihistamines are often recommended as second-line treatment (although the latest European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines relegate antihistamines to a third-line measure to help relieve cutaneous symptoms, due to concerns that their use might delay the appropriate further administration of epinephrine or fluids during patient stabilization). The benefit of antihistamines and glucocorticoids in both acute management and prevention of biphasic reactions has not been established, and there is increasing evidence that glucocorticoids may be harmful rather than simply being of no benefit. What role, if any, glucocorticoids and antihistamines should have in anaphylaxis management needs further clarification, potentially through comparison of outcomes between different units/regions. Reports from regional fatal anaphylaxis registries have suggested that modifiable risk factors for severe and fatal anaphylaxis appear to include polypharmacy in the elderly, delayed administration of epinephrine, maintaining an upright posture (with dependent lower body) during anaphylaxis, failure to recognize history of medication allergies, and failure to undertake venom immunotherapy in at-risk venom-allergic individuals.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^114yXqEr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society anaphylaxis — epinephrine primary treatment and initial management: Epinephrine is the essential, primary treatment that should be given once anaphylaxis has been diagnosed (1A). Given its effectiveness and rapid administration, intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The preferred injection site is the anterolateral thigh, followed by the deltoid (1B). Over-the-counter, metered-dose inhalers of epinephrine have not been found to be a practical or effective treatment for anaphylaxis (1B). Delay in epinephrine administration has been repeatedly associated with fatal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine may be given intravenous (IV) as a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses when anaphylactic shock is refractory to repeated IM injections (see "Dosage" and "Refractory Anaphylaxis" sections). If possible, separating the patient from the inciting allergen is prudent, but vomiting should not be induced to eliminate a food-based allergen (1C).

3.1 | Treatment of Refractory Anaphylaxis

3.1.1 | Adrenaline Is the Cornerstone of Anaphylaxis Treatment

IM adrenaline is the first-line anaphylaxis treatment in all current guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis in the community or hospital setting (Tables 2 and 3).

IM adrenaline is generally well-tolerated, in contrast to the IV route, where side effects are more common (sometimes due to dosing errors), including life-threatening arrhythmia when used by personnel not familiar with administering IV adrenaline. For this reason, the IV route is not recommended for the initial treatment of anaphylaxis in community and hospital settings except the perioperative setting. In the perioperative setting, adrenaline is always administered by personnel appropriately trained in the preparation and administration of adrenaline via the IV route, in well-monitored patients and thus the IV route is recommended (Tables 2 and 3). In addition, the absorption of IM adrenaline is slower than by IV route, less predictable and dependent on adequate circulation which is more likely to be compromised in perioperative anaphylaxis.

3.1.3 | Second-Line Treatment for the Most Severe Reactions

The evidence for second-line treatment of RA with cardiovascular compromise is limited, and mostly consists of case reports (Table 5, Figure 1). This constitutes a publication bias, as only positive clinical outcomes related to the use of these medications are generally reported. The relationship and causality between the administration of such treatment and clinical improvement reported is not proven.

3.1.3.1 | Vasopressors.

Beyond the use of continuous adrenaline as the first-line vasopressor, the administration of second-line vasopressors (i.e. noradrenaline, vasopressin and metaraminol) is proposed in most guidelines, but there is limited evidence to support the use of one vasopressor of another (Table 5). There are no strict guidelines on when to introduce a second vasopressor. In current practice, noradrenaline appears to be the most common second-line vasopressor used in anaphylactic shock. It was used in 77 (23%) out of 339 patients (of whom 28 [55%] out of 51 with grade IV) admitted to ICUs for severe anaphylaxis in France and in 18 (42%) out of 43 patients admitted for perioperative anaphylaxis in Japan. However, no evidence exists to justify noradrenaline in preference to another vasopressor in RA. Animal models suggest that vasopressors should be used in RA with persistent cardiovascular collapse, in addition to adrenaline infusion rather than as an alternative. Metaraminol is frequently used in many countries for perioperative anaphylaxis, and is cited in 4 out of 18 anaphylaxis guidelines; however, given equivalent mechanisms of action, metaraminol is unlikely to be more effective than IV adrenaline infusion. Noradrenaline and vasopressin may be preferable as vasopressors compared to dopamine due to insufficient efficacy to stabilise blood pressure, and side effects including tachycardia.

A reasonable approach is to commence additional vasopressors (noradrenaline or vasopressin), under the supervision of a trained staff, most of time in ICUs, preferably using a central venous access, in patients who continue to be hypotensive despite maximal adrenaline and fluid therapy. In these patients, a close cardiovascular monitoring is required to exclude myocardial dysfunction that would require other treatments.

Anaphylaxis — key considerations for EMS: When anaphylaxis is suspected, EMS personnel should always consider epinephrine as first-line treatment. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergencies, and a localized allergic reaction (e.g., urticaria or angioedema that does not compromise the airway) may be treated with antihistamine therapy. Cardiovascular collapse may occur abruptly, without the prior development of skin or respiratory symptoms, and constant monitoring of the patient's airway and breathing is essential.

### Benefits of epinephrine for anaphylaxis outweigh potential harm – A safety review [^116q3NRv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can progress quickly, and although fatal anaphylaxis is very rare, treatment should be given as soon as possible. The recommended first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular (IM) epinephrine. Yet epinephrine for anaphylaxis is underused, which can have deleterious, or even tragic, consequences. Although fear of self-injection substantially affects adherence, hesitancy to use epinephrine for anaphylaxis may be linked to the common unsubstantiated perception that epinephrine is dangerous. Therefore, the objective of this narrative review is to describe the safety of epinephrine when administered for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) are the greatest safety concern with epinephrine because of its known effects on cardiac output and vasoconstriction. Cardiovascular events and overdose are significantly more likely to occur with accidental intravenous bolus administration than IM administration. Although serious AEs have been reported with IM epinephrine, and there are potential risk factors for cardiovascular AEs for some patients, there are no absolute contraindications for its use in a life-threatening situation. Appropriately dosed and administered epinephrine should engender no fear of use for anaphylaxis. The potential harm of delaying or withholding epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis far outweighs the potential risk of AEs.

### EAACI guidelines: anaphylaxis (2021 update) [^1121RF1J]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency which all healthcare professionals need to be able to recognize and manage. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Anaphylaxis multidisciplinary Task Force has updated the 2014 guideline. The guideline was developed using the AGREE II framework and the GRADE approach. The evidence was systematically reviewed and recommendations were created by weighing up benefits and harms. The guideline was peer-reviewed by external experts and reviewed in a public consultation. The use of clinical criteria to identify anaphylaxis is suggested with blood sampling for the later measurement of tryptase. The prompt use of intramuscular adrenaline as first-line management is recommended with the availability of adrenaline autoinjectors to patients in the community. Pharmacokinetic data should be provided for adrenaline autoinjector devices. Structured, comprehensive training for people at risk of anaphylaxis is recommended. Simulation training and visual prompts for healthcare professionals are suggested to improve the management of anaphylaxis. It is suggested that school policies reflect anaphylaxis guidelines. The evidence for the management of anaphylaxis remains mostly at a very low level. There is an urgent need to prioritize clinical trials with the potential to improve the management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis.

Are corticosteroids effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendations

1 We suggest against the routine use of corticosteroids to treat anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 We suggest corticosteroids may be used as a third line intervention to treat underlying asthma or shock (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence)

(adapted from RCUK 2008 and JTFPP 2020 guidelines, in view of new data which casts further doubt on the efficacy of steroids to prevent biphasic reactions and possibility of harm (increased need for hospitalisation) in at least one study)

Rationale

The primary action of corticosteroids is the downregulation of the late (rather than early) phase inflammatory response. Given the (slow) absorption kinetics of corticosteroids and their mechanism of action (i.e. through an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB), it is theoretically unlikely that corticosteroids are of benefit in the acute treatment of anaphylaxis;, the rationale for use is therefore to prevent biphasic reactions. However, a 2012 Cochrane systematic review concluded "clinicians should be aware of the lack of a strong evidence base for the use of a glucocorticoid for anaphylaxis". Subsequent systematic reviews have confirmed the absence of evidence that corticosteroids reduce reaction severity or prevent biphasic reactions.

As with antihistamines, corticosteroids are administered far more frequently than adrenaline for the acute treatment of anaphylaxis, implying that their use may distract from the need to administer adrenaline. However, of greater concern is emerging evidence that routine use of corticosteroids for anaphylaxis may be harmful, and associated with increased morbidity even after correcting for confounding by indication. In the Canadian C-CARE registry, hospitalisation and/or admission to intensive care was associated with prehospital treatment with corticosteroids (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.55–6.97, adjusted for reaction severity and treatments administered). It is unclear why steroids might increase morbidity: the association was present even after adjusting for prehospital adrenaline.

We therefore recommend against the routine use of corticosteroids to treat anaphylaxis (weak recommendation). Corticosteroids may be of benefit in the following specific scenarios: refractory anaphylaxis (defined as anaphylaxis requiring ongoing treatment despite two appropriate doses of IM adrenaline) and anaphylaxis occurring in the context of poorly-controlled asthma. With the absence of evidence in such cases and the possibility of a different risk:benefit ratio, it is reasonable to include corticosteroids as part of the management for refractory anaphylaxis, but only as an adjunct and not in preference to adrenaline or other inotropes/vasopressor agents.

### Anaphylaxis on the other front line: perspectives from the emergency department [^112ihZTf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although most cases of anaphylaxis are treated in the emergency department (ED), personnel may not immediately recognize anaphylaxis based on presenting symptoms because it has a wide range of clinical manifestations and variable progression. When symptoms happen to be atypical or mild and when no trigger is identified, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be challenging. Underdiagnosis of anaphylaxis can lead to delayed use of appropriate first-line epinephrine in favor of treatments that should be used as adjunctive only. Even when anaphylaxis is recognized, the choice between an epinephrine autoinjector or epinephrine ampule can still present a challenge. Treatment of anaphylaxis in the ED should include a combination of intramuscular epinephrine, supplemental oxygen, and intravenous fluids. If there is an incomplete response to the initial dose of epinephrine, additional doses or other measures may be considered. The most important management consideration is avoiding treatment delays, because symptoms can progress rapidly. Upon discharge from the ED, all patients with anaphylaxis should be given a prescription for at least 2 epinephrine autoinjectors, an initial emergency action plan, education about avoidance of triggers, and a referral to an allergist. A significant limitation of current studies is that clinical outcomes in anaphylaxis associated with established poor rates of diagnosis and use of recommended treatments are unclear; such trials must be conducted as supporting evidence for ED management guidelines for anaphylaxis.

### Prevention of anaphylaxis: the role of the epinephrine auto-injector [^115tCTDo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition, with at-risk individuals remaining at chronic high risk of recurrence. Anaphylaxis is frequently underrecognized and undertreated by healthcare providers. The first-line pharmacologic intervention for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, and guidelines uniformly agree that its prompt administration is vital to prevent progression, improve patient outcomes, and reduce hospitalizations and fatalities. Healthcare costs potentially associated with failure to provide epinephrine (hospitalizations and emergency department visits) generally exceed those of its provision. At-risk patients are prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors to facilitate timely administration in the event of an anaphylactic episode. Despite guideline recommendations that patients carry 2 auto-injectors at all times, a significant proportion of patients fail to do so, with cost of medicine cited as one reason for this lack of adherence. With the increase of high-deductible healthcare plans, patient adherence to recommendations may be further affected by increased cost sharing. The recognition and classification of epinephrine as a preventive medicine by both the US Preventive Services Task Force and insurers could increase patient access, improve outcomes, and save lives.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: an overview of current guidelines [^112uG9Ud]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

4 | Conclusions

The management of RA is likely to be improved by improving recognition of severe reactions early, and treating such reactions with appropriate therapy (Figure 2). Defining RA as when anaphylaxis does not respond to two doses of adrenaline and appropriate initial fluid therapy would be a pragmatic choice in flagging the potential for severe reactions, in particular in the perioperative setting, and thus the need to escalate and seek expert help and commence treatment with intravenous adrenaline infusion and additional resuscitative measures. There are limited clinical data to inform the optimal dose of adrenaline IV infusion, fluid therapy (type, timing and volume) and second-line treatment; however, sufficient data exist to inform guidelines in the absence of high-quality studies. Further clinical data are needed to help align current guidelines towards a consensus on how to manage RA.

### Epinephrine: the drug of choice for anaphylaxis. A statement of the World Allergy Organization [^117C6RX8]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multi-system allergic reaction. Most consensus guidelines for the past 30 years have held that epinephrine is the drug of choice and the first drug that should be administered in acute anaphylaxis. Some state that properly administered epinephrine has no absolute contraindication in this clinical setting. A committee of anaphylaxis experts assembled by the World Allergy Organization has examined the evidence from the medical literature concerning the appropriate use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. The Committee strongly believes that epinephrine is currently underutilized and often dosed suboptimally to treat anaphylaxis, is under-prescribed for potential future self-administration, that most of the reasons proposed to withhold its clinical use are flawed, and that the therapeutic benefits of epinephrine exceed the risk when given in appropriate i.m. doses.

### H1-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis: cochrane systematic review [^112hbs19]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is an acute systemic allergic reaction, which can be life-threatening. H(1)-antihistamines are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of anaphylaxis. We sought to assess the benefits and harm of H(1)-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006); EMBASE (1966 to June 2006); CINAHL (1982 to June 2006) and ISI Web of Science (1945 to July 2006). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. Randomized and quasi-randomized-controlled trials comparing H(1)-antihistamines with placebo or no intervention were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized-controlled trials are needed, although these are likely to prove challenging to design and execute.

### Emergency medicine updates: anaphylaxis [^113XAv8v]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anaphylaxis is a potentially deadly condition that requires emergent therapy. While frequently treated in the emergency department (ED), recent evidence updates may improve the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

The presentation of anaphylaxis can vary. Current diagnostic criteria can be helpful when evaluating patients for anaphylaxis, though multiple criteria exist. While the most common causes of anaphylaxis include medications, insect venom, and foods, recent literature has identified an IgE antibody response to mammalian galactose alpha-1,3-galactose, known as alpha-gal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the first-line therapy and is given in doses of 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.5 mg in adults) intramuscularly (IM) in the anterolateral thigh. Intravenous (IV) epinephrine administration is recommended in patients refractory to IM epinephrine and IV fluids, or those with cardiovascular collapse. Antihistamines and glucocorticoids should not delay administration of epinephrine and do not demonstrate a significant reduction in risk of biphasic reactions. Biphasic reactions may affect 1–7% of patients with anaphylaxis. Risk factors for biphasic reaction include severe initial presentation and repeated doses of epinephrine. Disposition of patients with anaphylaxis requires consideration of several factors.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians must be aware of current updates in the evaluation and management of this disease.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: an overview of current guidelines [^111eL1Bz]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

1 | Introduction

Large case series report that less than 20% of anaphylaxis reactions are treated with adrenaline. Patel et al. recently undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis and found that around 90% of anaphylaxis events respond to a single dose of adrenaline. These data suggest that the majority of anaphylaxis reactions resolve spontaneously or with just a single dose of adrenaline. However, life-threatening anaphylaxis does occur, with an estimated mortality of 0.5%–1%, up to 5% in the perioperative setting. Severe anaphylaxis is unpredictable. All international guidelines recommend that adrenaline is the first-line anaphylaxis therapy and should be repeated for persistent or worsening signs combined with fluid resuscitation.

Recently, an entity of treatment-refractory anaphylaxis (RA) has been proposed in the literature, although slightly different definitions have been proposed (Table 1). The Resuscitation Council United Kingdom (RCUK) defines RA as an anaphylaxis which fails to adequately respond to 2 doses of IM adrenaline, the aim being that this scenario should immediately prompt escalation in terms of both treatment and the need for staff with appropriate expertise in managing severe reactions. This is similar to that used in an analysis of data from the European Anaphylaxis Registry and also very close to the definition proposed by a 19-member panel of experts in the United States (US) using Delphi methodology, which suggested RA is a reaction 'treated with 3 or more appropriate doses of adrenaline (or initiation of an intravenous [IV] adrenaline infusion) in addition to symptom directed medical management'.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^117NFU7X]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We used the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process to evaluate current evidence for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis, incorporating a public consultation, to inform the updated 2021 Resuscitation Council UK Anaphylaxis Guideline.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^116yvLpA]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is no RCT or quasi-RCT evidence to support the use of antihistamines in treating anaphylaxis. Antihistamines do not lead to resolution of respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms of anaphylaxis, or improve survival.H1-antihistamines cause sedation which can confound symptoms of anaphylaxis, and if given by rapid intravenous bolus may precipitate hypotension. Recent guidelines relegate antihistamines to a second or third-line intervention; most express a concern that their use can delay the administration of both initial and subsequent doses of adrenaline. This is based on a large number of datasets which report that the majority of patients presenting with anaphylaxis to Emergency Departments are treated with antihistamines, yet only a minority receive adrenaline – despite an increasing emphasis on adrenaline as the first-line intervention in international guidelines. In a large, national prospective registry (Cross-Canada Anaphylaxis Registry, C-CARE), 3498 cases of anaphylaxis were enrolled over a 6 year period; prehospital antihistamine use was associated with a lower rate of administration of > 1 adrenaline dose (adjusted OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44–0.85), but not other outcomes (hospitalisation/intensive care, intravenous fluids). Moreover, this finding was not robust at sensitivity analyses: excluding less severe reactions, prehospital antihistamine did not affect outcomes; unfortunately, the authors did not assess the impact on > 2 doses of adrenaline being given. An association between pre-hospital antihistamine use and delayed presentation to healthcare facilities has been reported, resulting in delays in adrenaline administration and increased morbidity. Antihistamines do not reduce the occurrence of biphasic reactions. An analysis of 9171 anaphylaxis episodes reported to the European Anaphylaxis Register found that antihistamine treatment was significantly associated with the occurrence of biphasic reactions (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14–2.02); this may be due to antihistamine use delaying adrenaline administration. We therefore recommend against antihistamines for the acute management of anaphylaxis (weak recommendation); this in consistent with the ASCIA 2020 Guideline.

### Anaphylaxis treatment: current barriers to adrenaline auto-injector use [^115ELCzT]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition that is increasing in prevalence in the developed world. There is universal expert agreement that rapid intramuscular injection of adrenaline is life-saving and constitutes the first-line treatment of anaphylaxis. The unpredictable nature of anaphylaxis and its rapid progression makes necessary the availability of a portable emergency treatment suitable for self-administration. Thus, anaphylaxis treatment guidelines recommend that at-risk patients are provided with adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs). Despite these clear recommendations, current emergency treatment of anaphylaxis continues to be inadequate in many cases. The aim of this review is to highlight the barriers that exist to the use and availability of AAIs and that prevent proper management of anaphylaxis. In addition, we review the characteristics of all AAIs that are presently available in Europe and the United States and discuss the need for regulatory requirements to establish the performance characteristics of these devices.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^114zFtau]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There is an alarming absence of RCTs evaluating the treatments for anaphylaxis in children. High quality studies are needed and are possible to design despite the severe and acute nature of this condition. Future trials should ensure appropriate comparator therapy that satisfies the ethical constraints inherent in resuscitation research and studies involving children, and the selection of appropriate outcome measures.

Research designs other than RCTs are still useful and can enhance the evidence for anaphylaxis treatment. Practice surveys in different settings, observational studies, and qualitative patient/family-centered studies are feasible and easy to design. Based on the results of this systematic review, it is impossible to make conclusive recommendations regarding optimal dosing, timing, or mode of administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. Furthermore, there is no evidence from RCTs supporting or refuting the use of common adjunctive treatments, such as corticosteroids and antihistamines, in the acute treatment of anaphylaxis, in preventing biphasic reactions, or after discharge from the ER. Until high-quality studies are designed and executed, current practices and guidelines on the management of anaphylaxis will continue to be based on lower quality evidence and on the consensus opinions of experts.

The careful selection and validation of outcome measures for future studies on pediatric anaphylaxis will support meaningful research and better treatment of children with this condition. Consistent universal reporting of these outcomes will protect against outcome reporting bias.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^114MhG3L]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There are no trials comparing different routes of adrenaline administration in patients during anaphylaxis. IM adrenaline is recommended over other routes of administration for initial treatment of anaphylaxis, due to a favourable adverse event profile (including in those with cardiovascular co-morbidities). The subcutaneous route is not recommended, on the basis of (low certainty) evidence that higher plasma adrenaline levels are achieved by the IM route; the available data relates to pharmacokinetic studies undertaken in patients outside the context of an allergic reaction and "may be confounded by using different injection sites (thigh versus arm), in addition to different depth of injection". Comparing the IM to IV route, the EAACI 2020 systematic review identified a single case series (children and adults) which found that "IV bolus administration was associated with a 13% increase in the incidence of adrenaline overdose and an 8% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events compared with IM administration". Excessive doses of adrenaline, particularly by the IV route, can cause tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke. Fatalities have occurred in the UK due to the inappropriate use of intravenous adrenaline to treat allergic (but non-anaphylaxis) reactions. Both IM and IV routes are recommended for treating perioperative anaphylaxis by experienced anaesthetists, although international guidelines recommend IM adrenaline for first-line treatment of anaphylaxis in all settings. If cardiac arrest is imminent or has already occurred, an intravenous (or interosseous) bolus dose of adrenaline is indicated.

Although the evidence was assessed as being of low certainty, the working group agreed with the evaluation in other guidelines that "given the totality of the evidence and clinical experience over many decades… a strong recommendation for the use of intramuscular adrenaline was appropriate". A strong recommendation for the IM route was deemed justified, as the working group placed a high value on the relative ease and safety of IM adrenaline administration by a wide variety of healthcare staff, and the current acceptance of the IM route in both clinical and non-clinical settings (including by patients for self-administration using an autoinjector device). Despite the limited evidence, we have made a strong recommendation for titrating the dose of adrenaline (as an intravenous infusion) against the clinical response, since this is routine in clinical practice to mitigate against the side effects of excessive adrenaline administration.

### The management of anaphylaxis in childhood: position paper of the European academy of allergology and clinical immunology [^1167RcDR]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a growing paediatric clinical emergency that is difficult to diagnose because a consensus definition was lacking until recently. Many European countries have no specific guidelines for anaphylaxis. This position paper prepared by the EAACI Taskforce on Anaphylaxis in Children aims to provide practical guidelines for managing anaphylaxis in childhood based on the limited evidence available. Intramuscular adrenaline is the acknowledged first-line therapy for anaphylaxis, in hospital and in the community, and should be given as soon as the condition is recognized. Additional therapies such as volume support, nebulized bronchodilators, antihistamines or corticosteroids are supplementary to adrenaline. There are no absolute contraindications to administering adrenaline in children. Allergy assessment is mandatory in all children with a history of anaphylaxis because it is essential to identify and avoid the allergen to prevent its recurrence. A tailored anaphylaxis management plan is needed, based on an individual risk assessment, which is influenced by the child's previous allergic reactions, other medical conditions and social circumstances. Collaborative partnerships should be established, involving school staff, healthcare professionals and patients' organizations. Absolute indications for prescribing self-injectable adrenaline are prior cardiorespiratory reactions, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, idiopathic anaphylaxis and persistent asthma with food allergy. Relative indications include peanut or tree nut allergy, reactions to small quantities of a given food, food allergy in teenagers and living far away from a medical facility. The creation of national and European databases is expected to generate better-quality data and help develop a stepwise approach for a better management of paediatric anaphylaxis.

### Alternatives to injectable adrenaline for treating anaphylaxis [^114w3QMK]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenaline is the first line treatment for anaphylaxis and adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI) allow reliable, safe and ergonomic administration in the community. However, AAIs have significant limitations and adrenaline is often not used in anaphylaxis. Innovations to administer adrenaline via alternative routes may potentially improve usage rates and treatment effectiveness. Here, we describe the known limitations and barriers to AAI use in anaphylaxis. We then summarise current data for adrenaline devices which use alternative routes of administration for treating anaphylaxis. Several novel devices are in development, which deliver adrenaline via nasal, sublingual or transcutaneous routes. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety studies have compared these treatments with AAI or intramuscular adrenaline via needle and syringe. The first non-injectable adrenaline delivery device for emergency treatment of anaphylaxis was approved in Europe and the United States. Neffy, an adrenaline nasal spray, is licensed for use in adult and paediatric patients who weigh at least 30kg. In the near future, multiple alternatives to injectable adrenaline may be available for managing anaphylaxis, overcoming some, but not all of the limitations of AAIs.

### H1-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without shock [^1139mG4G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is an acute systemic allergic reaction, which can be life-threatening. H1-antihistamines are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harm of H1-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006); EMBASE (1966 to June 2006); CINAHL (1982 to June 2006) and ISI Web of Science (1945 to July 2006). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing H1-antihistamines with placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Main Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed, although these are likely to prove challenging to design and execute.

### Clinical practice guideline: immunotherapy for inhalant allergy [^114aTMaW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis management during allergen immunotherapy (AIT) — epinephrine is 'universally recommended as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis administered intramuscularly into the vastus lateralis (antero-lateral thigh)'. Intramuscular dosing is '0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/mL (1:1000), up to 0.5 mg in adults and 0.3 mg in children and teenagers', and 'Clinicians should administer additional doses of intramuscular epinephrine every 5 to 15 minutes if anaphylaxis signs or symptoms persist', with 'no absolute contraindications to its use for anaphylaxis'. Supportive care includes 'placing the patient in a supine position if their presentation is mainly cardiovascular, monitoring vital signs, and administration of oxygen for patients with respiratory distress and those receiving further doses of epinephrine', plus fluids where 'Intravenous fluids are to be administered early… and should be repeated if lack of response', and 'should also be given in severe anaphylaxis with a respiratory presentation if a second dose of intramuscular epinephrine is required', while patients with lower respiratory symptoms 'should receive inhaled beta-2 agonists following initial treatment with epinephrine'.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^111cNTT7]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Are additional doses of adrenaline effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis reactions refractory to initial treatment with adrenaline?

Updated recommendations

1 Subsequent doses of adrenaline should be given every 5 min, titrated to clinical response, in patients whose symptoms are refractory to initial treatment (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 Where respiratory and/or cardiovascular features of anaphylaxis persist despite 2 appropriate doses of adrenaline (administered by IM or IV route), seek urgent expert help (e.g. from experienced critical care clinicians) to establish an intravenous adrenaline infusion to treat refractory anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence).
3 Low dose intravenous adrenaline infusions appear to be effective and safe to treat refractory anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

### Managing anaphylaxis: epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids: more than 10 years of cross-Canada anaphylaxis REgistry data [^112sfpXq]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis but is often replaced with antihistamines or corticosteroids. Delayed epinephrine administration is a risk factor for fatal anaphylaxis. Convincing data on the role of antihistamines and corticosteroids in anaphylaxis management are sparse.

Objective

To establish the impact of prehospital treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids on anaphylaxis management.

Methods

Patients presenting with anaphylaxis were recruited prospectively and retrospectively in 10 Canadian and 1 Israeli emergency departments (EDs) between April 2011 and August 2022, as part of the Cross-Canada Anaphylaxis REgistry. Data on anaphylaxis cases were collected using a standardized form. Primary outcomes were uncontrolled reactions (> 2 doses of epinephrine in ED), no prehospital epinephrine use, use of intravenous fluids in ED, and hospital admission. Multivariate regression was used to identify factors associated with primary outcomes.

Results

Among 5364 reactions recorded, median age was 8.8 years (IQR, 3.78–16.9); 54.9% of the patients were males, and 52.5% had a known food allergy. In the prehospital setting, 37.9% received epinephrine; 44.3% received antihistamines, and 3.15% received corticosteroids. Uncontrolled reactions happened in 250 reactions. Patients treated with prehospital epinephrine were less likely to have uncontrolled reactions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.955 [95% CI, 0.943–0.967]), receive intravenous fluids in ED (aOR, 0.976 [95% CI, 0.959–0.992]), and to be admitted after the reaction (aOR, 0.964 [95% CI, 0.949–0.980]). Patients treated with prehospital antihistamines were less likely to have uncontrolled reactions (aOR, 0.978 [95% CI, 0.967–0.989]) and to be admitted after the reaction (aOR, 0.963 [95% CI, 0.949–0.977]). Patients who received prehospital corticosteroids were more likely to require intravenous fluids in ED (aOR, 1.059 [95% CI, 1.013–1.107]) and be admitted (aOR, 1.232 [95% CI, 1.181–1.286]).

Conclusion

Our findings in this predominantly pediatric population support the early use of epinephrine and suggest a beneficial effect of antihistamines. Corticosteroid use in anaphylaxis should be revisited.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113L6H18]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations:

1 We suggest that antihistamines are not used as part of the initial emergency treatment for anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, low certainty evidence) - antihistamines have no role in treating respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms of anaphylaxis 2 We suggest antihistamines are used to treat skin symptoms which often occur as part of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence) - their use must not delay management of respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms of anaphylaxis (using adrenaline and IV fluids).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^111Zj7Zz]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Wilderness Medical Society convened a panel to review the literature and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of anaphylaxis, with an emphasis on a field-based perspective. The review also included literature regarding the definition, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention of anaphylaxis. The increasing prevalence of food allergies in the United States raises concern for a corresponding rise in the incidence of anaphylaxis. Intramuscular epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis and should be administered before adjunctive treatments such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and inhaled β agonists. For outdoor schools and organizations, selecting a method to administer epinephrine in the field is based on considerations of cost, safety, and first responder training, as well as federal guidelines and state-specific laws.

### Anaphylaxis [^116gpKqk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is the quintessential critical illness in emergency medicine. Symptoms are rapid in onset and death can occur within minutes. Approximately 1500 patients die annually in the United States from this deadly disorder. It is imperative, therefore, that emergency care providers be able to diagnose and appropriately treat patients with anaphylaxis. Any delays in recognition or initiation of therapy can result in unnecessary increases in patient morbidity and mortality.

Discussion

Recent literature, including updated international anaphylaxis guidelines, has improved our understanding and management of this critical illness. Anaphylaxis is a multisystem disorder that can manifest signs and symptoms related to the cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Epinephrine remains the drug of choice and should initially be administered intramuscularly, into the anterolateral thigh, as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. For patients unresponsive to repeated intramuscular injections, a continuous infusion of epinephrine should be started. Antihistamines and corticosteroids are second-line medications and should never be given in lieu of, or prior to, epinephrine. Aggressive fluid resuscitation should also be used to treat the intravascular volume depletion characteristic of anaphylaxis. Patient observation and disposition should be individualized, as there is no well-defined period of observation after resolution of signs and symptoms.

Conclusions

For patients with anaphylaxis, rapid and appropriate administration of epinephrine is critical for survival. Additional therapy, such as supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, and corticosteroids should not delay the administration of epinephrine.

### First European data from the network of severe allergic reactions (NORA) [^11693zud]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Occurrence, elicitors and treatment of severe allergic reactions are recognized and reported differently between countries. We aimed to collect standardized data throughout Europe on anaphylaxis referred for diagnosis and counselling.

Methods

Tertiary allergy, dermatology and paediatric units in 10 European countries took part in this pilot phase of the first European Anaphylaxis Registry, from June 2011 to March 2014. An online questionnaire was used to collect data on severe allergic reactions based on the medical history and diagnostics.

Results

Fifty-nine centres reported 3333 cases of anaphylaxis, with 26.7% below 18 years of age. Allergic reactions were mainly caused by food (children and adults 64.9% and 20.2%, respectively) and insect venom (20.2% and 48.2%) and less often by drugs (4.8% and 22.4%). Most reactions occurred within 30 min of exposure (80.5%); a delay of 4+ hours was mainly seen in drug anaphylaxis (6.7%). Symptom patterns differed by elicitor, with the skin being affected most often (84.1%). A previous, usually milder reaction to the same allergen was reported by 34.2%. The mainstay of first-line treatment by professionals included corticoids (60.4%) and antihistamines (52.8%). Only 13.7% of lay- or self-treated reactions to food and 27.6% of insect anaphylaxis received on-site adrenaline.

Conclusion

This pilot phase of a pan-European registry for severe allergic reactions provides for the first time data on anaphylaxis throughout Europe, demonstrates its potential functionality and allows a comparison of symptom patterns, elicitors and treatment habits between referral centres and countries.

### Comparison of international guidelines for the emergency medical management of anaphylaxis [^117BsTRz]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guideline-based treatment approaches for managing anaphylaxis are widely believed to result in good outcomes, but the strength of evidence underpinning the recommendations made therein is unclear.

Objective

To identify and compare national guidelines for the emergency medical management of anaphylaxis and to describe the extent to which the evidence base in support of key recommendations is made clear.

Methods

We systematically searched key medical databases and contacted the World Allergy Organization and anaphylaxis charities in several countries to identify national guidelines. Full text copies of relevant papers were obtained and, where necessary, translated. Data were abstracted onto a customized data extraction sheet; this process was independently checked by a second reviewer.

Results

Guidelines originating from Australia, Canada, Russia, UK, Ukraine and the United States were identified. While these were in agreement on the broad principles of management, there were important variations in relation to the treatments to be used and the dose and route of administration of these preparations. Most guidelines failed to make clear the strength of evidence underpinning the recommendations being made.

Conclusions

There are important international differences in the recommended emergency management of anaphylaxis. It is important that an agreed core evidence-based guideline for the management of anaphylaxis is now developed, which can then be adapted for national/local use. Clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of existing guidelines.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^115b4cfi]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

With respect to second-line vasopressors, "no clear superiority of dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or vasopressin (either added to [adrenaline] alone, or compared with one another), has been demonstrated in clinical trials". The ASCIA 2020 Guideline recommends consideration of other vasopressors or inotropes only if an IV adrenaline infusion is ineffective. Animal models suggest that early treatment with adrenaline followed by continuous adrenaline or vasopressin infusion is superior to vasopressin alone, thus confirming that adrenaline must be considered the first-line intervention to treat anaphylactic shock.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^113ixCom]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines — field treatment directives for anaphylaxis specify that intramuscular epinephrine is the primary treatment and should be administered before adjunctive treatments such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and inhaled β agonists. For outdoor schools and organizations, selecting a method to administer epinephrine in the field is based on considerations of cost, safety, and first responder training, as well as federal guidelines and state-specific laws. Prior guidelines in 2010 and 2014 supported the concept that nonmedical professionals whose duties include providing first aid or emergency medical care in the field also be trained to administer epinephrine for anaphylaxis, and the current guidelines expand the focus to the broader field treatment of anaphylaxis, with consideration for hospital-based treatment.

Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines — scope and evidence methods state that the Society convened a panel to review the literature and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of anaphylaxis, with an emphasis on a field-based perspective, and that the review also included literature regarding the definition, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention of anaphylaxis. Methodologically, anaphylaxis, with its potentially drastic course, does not lend itself to study in randomized, controlled trials, so the authors reviewed the literature for the best available evidence, including observational studies, case series, limited controlled trials, extrapolation from physiological data, and expert consensus.

### Immediate hypersensitivity reaction to chemotherapeutic agents [^113RKkpa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

An increase by 70% in new cases of cancer is expected over the next 2 decades, with more than 8 million people dying each year from the disease, an estimated 13% of all deaths worldwide. Several new chemotherapeutic agents have been rapidly developed and many of them approved through a fast-track process. In parallel, adverse reactions to chemotherapy have increased dramatically worldwide, frequently preventing the use of first-line therapy for cancer and jeopardizing patients' treatment outcomes. The present review focuses on immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs) induced by chemotherapeutic agents. We address general features of these reactions and specific characteristics of the most prevalent agents involved. On the basis of scientific evidence, we suggest classifying acute reactions to chemotherapy as toxic, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and IHRs (anaphylactic-type reactions). IHRs to chemotherapeutic agents are unpredictable adverse reactions with potentially lethal consequences. Correct diagnosis and proper management of oncologic patients with IHRs are fundamental in order not to deprive them of the first-line treatment for their disease. In this scenario, rapid drug desensitization is a groundbreaking procedure that enables selected patients to receive the drug that induced an IHR in a safe way, minimizing the risks of anaphylaxis and treatment failure.

### Knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^112bwVoj]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis impede the clinician's ability to effectively manage patients with anaphylaxis. This review will emphasize the lack of a global consensus on defining and determining the severity of anaphylaxis; the need for validating biomarkers used for diagnosing anaphylaxis; and data collection deficiencies. Perioperative anaphylaxis has a wide differential diagnosis, often requires treatment beyond epinephrine, and poses a challenge for the clinician in identifying the responsible trigger(s) and in preventing future reactions. Consensus-derived definitions and determination of risk factors for biphasic, refractory, and persistent anaphylaxis are needed, recognizing that these often affect the emergency department observation time after recovery from initial anaphylaxis. Knowledge gaps exist in the use of epinephrine, including route of administration, dosage, needle length, and ideal timing for administration. Consensus is needed on when and how many epinephrine autoinjectors to prescribe and how to prevent patient underuse and accidental injury. The role of antihistamines and corticosteroids in the prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis requires consensus and additional research. A consensus-derived algorithm for management of idiopathic anaphylaxis is needed. The role of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the incidence, severity, and treatment of anaphylaxis remains unanswered. Rapid recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis in the community needs improvement. The article will conclude with exploring the recommended components of both a patient-specific and generic anaphylaxis emergency plan, including when to activate emergency medical services, all of which are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### H2-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without shock: a systematic review [^1161okEd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, which is rapid in onset and sometimes can prove fatal. Although H2-antihistamines are often administered for emergency treatment in anaphylaxis, there is uncertainty about their effectiveness in this disease.

Objective

To assess the benefits and harms of H2-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Methods

A systematic review was performed of randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing H2-antihistamines with placebo or no intervention in patients with anaphylaxis.

Results

The authors failed to identify any eligible studies for inclusion in this systematic review.

Conclusion

When H2-antihistamines are recommended for anaphylaxis treatment, the status of the evidence base supporting their use should be described. Well-designed randomized controlled trials investigating the role of H2-antihistamines in anaphylaxis treatment are urgently needed.

Corticosteroids in anaphylaxis — Evidence of benefit for corticosteroids in anaphylaxis is inconsistent; however, pending conclusive evidence, continued empiric use is reasonable given the potential for benefit paired with a low side-effect profile (1C). In particular, corticosteroids should be given for anaphylaxis with a respiratory component in asthmatic patients (1C).

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^1151Em7g]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The Resuscitation Council UK has updated its Guideline for healthcare providers on the Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. As part of this process, an evidence review was undertaken by the Guideline Working Group, using an internationally-accepted approach for adoption, adaptation, and de novo guideline development based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence to decision (EtD) framework, referred to as GRADE-ADOLOPMENT. A number of significant changes have been made, which will be reflected in the updated Guideline. These include: emphasis on repeating intramuscular adrenaline doses after 5 min if symptoms of anaphylaxis do not resolve; corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone) no longer being routinely recommended for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis; interventions for reactions which are refractory to initial treatment with adrenaline; a recommendation against the use of antihistamines for the acute management of anaphylaxis; and guidance relating to the duration of observation following anaphylaxis, and timing of discharge.

### First-aid treatment of anaphylaxis to food: focus on epinephrine [^114AYbkV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Avoiding food triggers for anaphylactic reactions (severe acute systemic allergic reactions) is easier said than done. Most episodes of anaphylaxis to food occur unexpectedly in the community in the absence of a health care professional. All individuals at risk should therefore have an emergency action plan in place. The cornerstone of first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injected intramuscularly in the vastus lateralis muscle (lateral aspect of the thigh). In this review, we focus on epinephrine. We examine a therapeutic dilemma: the issue of epinephrine dose selection in an individual for whom no optimal fixed-dose auto-injector formulation exists, and a therapeutic controversy: the issue of epinephrine injection versus an oral H1-antihistamine in anaphylaxis episodes that appear to be mild. The pharmaceutical industry could address the first of these issues by providing a wider range of epinephrine fixed doses in easy-to-use auto-injectors, or by providing adjustable epinephrine doses in auto-injectors. The second issue could be addressed in part by development of alternative routes of epinephrine administration for the first-aid, out-of-hospital treatment of anaphylaxis.

### Allergists' self-reported adherence to anaphylaxis practice parameters and perceived barriers to care: an American college of allergy, asthma, and immunology member survey [^116kPk3Q]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and requires rapid medical intervention. Knowledge of treatment guidelines and addressing barriers to care are essential for appropriate management.

Objective

To investigate allergists' self-reported practices in managing patients at risk for anaphylaxis, specifically in following practice parameters for diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate use of epinephrine, and to identify perceived barriers to care.

Methods

Online questionnaires were distributed to members of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. The US physicians who self-identified as "allergist/immunologist" were eligible to participate. The first 500 completed questionnaires were analyzed.

Results

Nearly all (≥ 95%) reported adherence to practice parameters in prescribing an epinephrine auto-injector and instructing patients on its use, taking a detailed allergy history, counseling patients on avoidance measures, and educating patients on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. More than 90% stated they determined the best diagnostic procedures to identify triggers and coordinated laboratory and allergy testing. Adherence to practice parameters was less robust for providing patients with written action plans and in-office anaphylaxis preparedness. Perceived barriers to care included a significant proportion of patients who were uncomfortable using epinephrine auto-injectors and inadequate knowledge of anaphylaxis among referral physicians.

Conclusion

Allergists overwhelmingly adhere to practice parameter recommendations for the treatment and management of anaphylaxis, including appropriate use of epinephrine as first-line treatment, educating patients, and testing to diagnose anaphylaxis and identify its triggers. Opportunities for improvement include preparing staff and patients for anaphylactic events, providing written action plans, and improving knowledge of referring physicians.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113beyxM]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

What is the optimal timing of adrenaline in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Recommendation

Adrenaline should be administered early once symptoms of anaphylaxis have been recognized or suspected (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines)

Rationale

There is a lack of high-certainty evidence to differentiate the effect of early versus delayed administration of adrenaline on clinical outcomes. Case series (including reports of fatal anaphylaxis) suggest that early adrenaline administration for out-of-hospital anaphylaxis is associated with improved outcomes. There is no evidence that pre-emptive use of adrenaline to treat mild, non-anaphylaxis reactions prevents progression to anaphylaxis. However, despite the lack of evidence to inform the optimal timing of administration, it seems reasonable to recommend adrenaline is given as soon as features of anaphylaxis are apparent; this is the consensus reflected in international guidelines.

With respect to biphasic reactions, the 2020 JTFPP identified eight retrospective case series, three of which found that delayed administration was associated with a higher rate of biphasic reaction. A prospective cohort study of 430 anaphylaxis reactions found that delayed administration of adrenaline (more than 30 min after onset of symptoms) was associated with a higher rate of biphasic reaction (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.13–10.18). The 2020 JTFPP concluded that "there does appear to be a trend to lower rates of biphasic reactions with earlier epinephrine administration following development of anaphylaxis".

What is the optimal route of adrenaline to treat anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendations

1 The intramuscular (IM) route is recommended for initial adrenaline treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 The intravenous (IV) route is not recommended for initial management of anaphylaxis, except in the perioperative setting (as an alternative to IM adrenaline) by those skilled and experienced in its use (good practice statement).
- In such circumstances, adrenaline should preferably be administered as an IV infusion and not as a bolus dose (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
3 Titrate the administration of adrenaline (by any route) against clinical response (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines, with greater emphasis on IM route and where needed, use of IV adrenaline infusion rather than IV bolus therapy)

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^117XYJsf]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

This evidence review was undertaken by the Anaphylaxis Working Group of the Resuscitation Council UK (RCUK), to support the 2021 update of the RCUK guidelines for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. The Working Group used an internationally-accepted approach for adoption, adaptation, and de novo guideline development based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence to decision (EtD) framework, referred to as GRADE-ADOLOPMENT. The EtD framework facilitates the use of evidence in a structured and transparent way to inform decisions in the context of clinical and public health recommendations and decisions. The approach is outlined in Fig. 1. In brief, key research questions (see Table 1) were identified from the previous RCUK guideline. The EtD framework for each question/topic, incorporating a review of existing guidelines and published systematic reviews, was independently completed by two assessors. We included international guidelines irrespective of whether they used the GRADE EtD framework (and some guidelines preceded the EtD methodology). The EtD tables were then reviewed by the Working Group, and a consensus reached as to (i) the certainty of the available evidence (Table 2) and (ii) whether this supported the previous recommendation ("adopted"), indicated a need to update the recommendation ("adapted") or develop an entirely new recommendation. The strength for each recommendation was assigned as either strong or weak (see Table 3). Reasons for a weak recommendation include: the absence of high-certainty evidence; imprecision in outcome estimates; variability in the values and preferences of individuals regarding the outcomes of interventions; small benefits; applicability in all settings versus specific settings; and benefits that may not be worth the costs (including the costs of implementing the recommendation). These criteria are summarised in Table S1, supplementary material. Finally, recommendations and their evidence base were reviewed by a Consultation Panel (see acknowledgements) prior to a public consultation (via the Resuscitation Council UK website, between 23 December 2020 and 24 February 2021, resulting in 130 submissions) and finalisation by the working group.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^114x68Em]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This review failed to uncover any completed randomized or controlled trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatments despite a broad search strategy. Therefore, the primary objective could not be determined. In the one planned RCT of IV versus IM epinephrine, the two main outcomes proposed were resolution of the main clinical features of anaphylaxis (defined according to consensus definition), or improvement on an ordinal severity scale at 15 minutes. The planned secondary outcome was adverse effects at 15 and 60 minutes. The definition of anaphylaxis and its resolution were current, and the outcome measures proposed are appropriate.

Clinical implications

Epinephrine remains the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis although there are no RCTs supporting its use. Epinephrine has been relatively well investigated in both children and adults in observational studies, RCTs involving non-anaphylactic patients, epidemiologic studies, fatality studies, and in vitro and animal studies. Many of these studies have identified that delays in instituting treatment with epinephrine are associated with risks of mortality.

On the basis of this evidence, an expert panel published the 2011 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) guidelines for acute treatment of anaphylaxis. They recommended immediate use of intramuscular epinephrine, concluding that the benefits far outweigh the risks. They concluded that the quality of evidence is moderate, although the contribution of expert opinion is still significant. NIAID dosing recommendations for Epinephrine 1:1000 solution for children and adults is based on pharmacologic studies. They recommend 0.15 mg for children weighing 10–25 kg, and 0.3 mg for children over 25 kg. They also suggest repeat dosing every 5–15 minutes as needed.

While second line medications such as corticosteroids and antihistamines are still recommended as adjunctive treatments, the expert panel did note the lack of evidence for these modalities. Possible reasons for continuing poorly investigated interventions in pediatrics include: "biological plausibility" of the intervention, extrapolation of data from adult studies, acceptance of lower quality research, lack of known significant harm of the intervention, and a need to do "something" rather than nothing in acute situations. Perceived concerns about medico-legal liability may also contribute to provision of treatments with no known benefits and lack of perceived harm. In their report, NIAID identified several knowledge gaps, including the role of adjunctive treatments for anaphylaxis (steroids, antihistamines and others), appropriate treatment of biphasic or protracted reactions, and the benefits and risks of alternative routes of epinephrine dosing (e.g. sublingual).

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^111TZ3cc]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Studies have found that, despite epinephrine being the only anaphylaxis treatment with demonstrated efficacy in preventing mortality, it is not used consistently, and second-line or adjunctive medications are more often administered, sometimes before epinephrine. For example, a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients seen in a pediatric emergency department over a 5-year period with a final diagnosis of anaphylaxis showed a rate of epinephrine administration of only 54%. This was less than the rate of corticosteroids (78%) and H1 and/or H2 receptor antagonists (92%).

The administration of adjunctive medications can potentially delay the use of other, perhaps more effective treatment modalities and therefore might contribute to morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, both antihistamines and steroids have adverse effects and costs, and may theoretically mask important markers of ongoing anaphylaxis risk. Recurrent dosing of both epinephrine and steroids in the emergency department also carries risks of systemic side effects. These factors need to be weighed against the potential benefit of these treatments.

Limitations

A limitation of the current systematic review is that it was limited to studies done in the last twelve years. This time frame was considered acceptable as there are recent systematic reviews investigating anaphylaxis treatments that found no RCTs in databases extending up to thirty years into the past. Further limitations include the exclusion of non-English and non-registered trials.

Research implications

There are a number of possibilities to explain the current gap in research. Firstly, there are clearly ethical issues involved in obtaining informed consent (or deferring consent) in emergency situations. Secondly, current anaphylaxis treatments are usually life saving, generally safe, and well established, contributing to the perceived lack of relevance of specific questions regarding pharmacotherapy. Thirdly, due to the clinical nature of anaphylaxis diagnosis, lack of accepted standards for determining degree of severity and lack of objective point of care testing, study design can be challenging. Fourthly, a large number of patients is required for an adequately powered study assessing an uncommon condition such as pediatric anaphylaxis, and would require considerable resources over a long period of time. Additionally, prospectively collected data is essential and more valid in establishing accurate rates of adverse effects of pharmacotherapy and other interventions, but is also costly. Finally, pediatric research is associated with additional challenges, including a vulnerable and smaller population, the challenge of obtaining informed consent/assent from children, and the need to address family-centered outcomes in both treatment and investigation.

### A 13.2 mg epinephrine intranasal spray demonstrates comparable pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety to a 0.3 mg epinephrine autoinjector [^1167WF1M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of anaphylaxis, the current outpatient standard of care is an epinephrine autoinjector for self-administration or the use of intramuscular or intravenous epinephrine in a health care setting. The autoinjector is often referred to as an EpiPen (a trade name) as a result of the historical popularity of the brand; however, generic autoinjectors have become the mainstay of these prescribed devices, with different designs being used that can affect drug delivery efficiency and lead to the need for redosing to alleviate symptoms. As a result of the acute and life-threatening nature of anaphylaxis, delivery of a clinically meaningful dose of epinephrine in a timely fashion is critical to optimizing patient outcomes.

Recent updates to the guidelines for the acute management of anaphylaxis have identified both best practice and remaining unmet needs based on available therapeutic options. Because needle-based epinephrine devices are the only products available, intramuscular epinephrine remains the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, either by autoinjector or prefilled syringe. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are provided for all epinephrine autoinjector devices, supporting the benefits of acute and rapid bioavailability (BA) of epinephrine via autoinjectors as first-line management for patients experiencing an acute anaphylactic event.

### Self-administration of adrenaline for anaphylaxis during in-hospital food challenges improves health-related quality of life [^1167pUtp]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Current management according to national and international guidelines recommend intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine) as first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Individuals at risk of anaphylaxis should be prescribed adrenaline autoinjectors (AAIs) for self-administration as rescue treatment. Delays in treatment with adrenaline are associated with fatal outcomes. Up to 30% of food challenges in specialist centres, and 40% of reactions due to accidental exposure outside hospital, cause anaphylaxis. However, there is significant underuse of AAI to treat anaphylaxis, both in the prehospital environment and in hospital departments. This may relate to a failure to recognise anaphylaxis, or a reluctance to use an AAI, for example, due to fear of injectionor through delaying discharge after a planned food challenge.

Oral immunotherapy is an emerging treatment option for some food allergies; most protocols require participants to undergo an initial food challenge to confirm clinical reactivity. In this context, anaphylaxis may be more common, as participants are more likely to have true underlying food allergy. In addition, such protocols generally mandate the use of more objective criteria to determine a 'positive' challenge, which might increase the likelihood of anaphylaxis compared with more routine challenges where often softer symptoms result in earlier stopping and thus a lower cumulative allergen exposure. Anaphylaxis at food challenge could have a negative impact on the young person in terms of HRQL or that of their parent/carer. In addition, it may affect the young person's perceived ability and knowledge to self-manage an anaphylaxis reaction (a concept described as self-efficacy). We therefore sought to assess the impact of anaphylaxis on HRQL and self-efficacy in patients undergoing food challenge prior to commencing oral immunotherapy.

### Glucocorticoids for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113p2pif]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a serious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may result in death. Anaphylaxis guidelines recommend glucocorticoids for the treatment of people experiencing anaphylaxis.

Objectives

We sought to assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticoid treatment during episodes of anaphylaxis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (Ovid) (1988 to September 2009), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (to September 2009) and The Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1945 to September 2009). We also searched the UK National Research Register and websites listing ongoing trials, and contacted international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing glucocorticoids with any control (either placebo, adrenaline (epinephrine), an antihistamine, or any combination of these).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Main Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We are, based on this review, unable to make any recommendations for the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^113sw2WG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Myth 5: 'Antihistamines can be used to treat anaphylaxis initially; epinephrine is only needed if symptoms worsen'

Histamine is only one of many inflammatory mediators released during anaphylaxis. Oral antihistamines take around 30 min for onset of effect; intravenous chlorphenamine has a faster onset, but can cause hypotension. Antihistamines are not effective against anaphylaxis: their prophylactic use during controlled immunotherapy does not prevent anaphylaxis, and any apparent response during acute management of reactions is most likely due to the patient's own endogenous epinephrine. Antihistamines have now been relegated to third-line therapy in international guidelines; their use is limited to the relief of cutaneous symptoms and should never delay the administration of epinephrine or fluid resuscitation during patient stabilisation.

Myth 6: 'Corticosteroids prevent delayed or biphasic reactions in anaphylaxis'

Historically, corticosteroids have been used to prevent protracted and biphasic reactions (the latter defined as a recurrence of symptoms within 72 hours of initial anaphylaxis, without re-exposure to the trigger). However, this has never been tested in a randomised clinical trial; more recent evidence has cast doubt over their efficacy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 27 studies with 4114 anaphylaxis cases, of whom 192 (4.7%) had biphasic reactions. Steroid administration did not affect the likelihood of a late phase reaction (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.43). In fact, there was a non-significant trend towards increased risk, although this is probably because steroid use was more common with severe reactions. Biphasic reactions were more common where hypotension was present at initial reaction (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.15), but this is unusual in food-induced anaphylaxis. The median time to onset of biphasic symptoms was 11 (range 0.2–72) hours, that is, 50% of reactions occurred > 11 hours after initial reaction. This is relevant because current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends patients over 16 years are observed for 6–12 hours after anaphylaxis (children under 16 should be admitted). In reality, it is generally accepted that prolonged observation may not be required following a straightforward reaction in someone who already has a comprehensive management plan and rescue medication (including epinephrine autoinjectors) in place.

### Discrepancies in anaphylaxis protocols across emergency medical services in the United States: opportunities for improvement [^116MQK2P]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Across the United States, there are significant inconsistencies in the protocols used by emergency medical services (EMS) in the prehospital treatment of anaphylaxis. These discrepancies include variations in the definition of anaphylaxis and treatment recommendations.

Objective

To identify gaps in the recognition of anaphylaxis and to provide areas for improvement in prehospital management through an analysis of state-wide anaphylaxis protocols.

Methods

States with mandatory or model state-wide protocols were included (total of 30). Each allergic reaction and/or anaphylaxis protocol was reviewed-emphasis was placed on the definitions used to identify reactions and treatment algorithms.

Results

Of the 30 states, only 50% (15) included gastrointestinal symptoms in the definition of anaphylaxis and only 40% (12) included neurologic manifestations. In addition, 47% (14) used a 2-organ system definition. For anaphylactic reactions, 100% (30) of the protocols recommended diphenhydramine and epinephrine. However, 90% (27) recommended albuterol, if respiratory symptoms were present, and 60% (18) recommended steroids. Epinephrine was the first-line recommendation for anaphylaxis in 97% (29) of the protocols. Overall, 25 states (83%) allowed epinephrine autoinjectors and 17 (57%) provided autoinjectors.

Conclusion

Many EMS anaphylaxis protocols are incomplete and/or outdated. Many protocols do not consider gastrointestinal or neurologic manifestations. In addition, many contain outdated recommendations, including the use of steroids and first-generation antihistamines. Despite the convenience of epinephrine autoinjectors, many protocols do not permit or provide them. Given the frequency of EMS activation for allergic reactions, our communities would benefit from standardized protocols using current evidence-based guidelines for the management of anaphylaxis.

### Gaps between actual initial treatment of anaphylaxis in China and international guidelines: a review and analysis of 819 reported cases [^113QDgAM]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

6

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the actual initial treatment of anaphylaxis in China based on a literature review. Due to the space limitation, only four of the 748 studies included in this review were referenced. Our results indicated considerable underuse of epinephrine as the initial treatment of anaphylaxis. In contrast, glucocorticoids were inappropriately used as the first‐line drug in place of epinephrine. Moreover, 81.6% patients had received an overdose of epinephrine, and 45.5% patients received IV bolus injection, both of which were proved to be significantly associated with serious adverse effects of epinephrine. Our findings suggest that the actual initial treatment of anaphylaxis in China does not comply with the international anaphylaxis guidelines. Of note, none of these problems was discussed or mentioned in these reports. This implies a general lack of awareness about the gaps in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis among many Chinese healthcare professionals. 9 Our findings call for concerted efforts to remedify the current situation and to promote the safety of Chinese patients with anaphylaxis.

### Self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis [^114dJyGz]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Epinephrine is the primary medical therapy, and it must be administered promptly. This clinical report focuses on practical issues concerning the administration of self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis in the community. The recommended epinephrine dose for anaphylaxis in children, based primarily on anecdotal evidence, is 0.01 mg/kg, up to 0.30 mg. Intramuscular injection of epinephrine into the lateral thigh (vastus lateralis) is the preferred route for therapy in first-aid treatment. Epinephrine autoinjectors are currently available in only 2 fixed doses: 0.15 and 0.30 mg. On the basis of current, albeit limited, data, it seems reasonable to recommend autoinjectors with 0.15 mg of epinephrine for otherwise healthy young children who weigh 10 to 25 kg (22–55 lb) and autoinjectors with 0.30 mg of epinephrine for those who weigh approximately 25 kg (55 lb) or more; however, specific clinical circumstances must be considered in these decisions. This report also describes several quandaries in regard to management, including the selection of dose, indications for prescribing an autoinjector, and decisions regarding when to inject epinephrine. Effective care for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis requires a comprehensive management approach involving families, allergic children, schools, camps, and other youth organizations. Risk reduction entails confirmation of the trigger, discussion of avoidance of the relevant allergen, a written individualized emergency anaphylaxis action plan, and education of supervising adults with regard to recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis.
