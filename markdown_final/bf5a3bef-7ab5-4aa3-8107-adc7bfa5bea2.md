## Question

What is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in myasthenia gravis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in myasthenia gravis, specifically regarding indications, dosing, comparative efficacy versus plasma exchange, safety, special populations, and how to integrate IVIG with newer targeted therapies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios where IVIG is indicated. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline consensus. Next, I will review dosing regimens and onset/offset. After that, I need to compare IVIG with plasma exchange and consider antibody subtypes. I will then examine maintenance therapy and steroid-sparing claims. I should also review safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and how to position IVIG alongside modern complement and FcRn inhibitors, and close with a practical decision framework and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios where IVIG is appropriate. IVIG is indicated for acute exacerbations with respiratory or bulbar compromise, impending or manifest myasthenic crisis, and when a rapid immunomodulatory effect is needed such as preoperative stabilization or before initiating corticosteroids to mitigate transient worsening; it is also considered in refractory disease when conventional immunosuppressants are contraindicated or ineffective, and during pregnancy when a prompt, temporary response is required [^114XisZB] [^1156yKU1] [^115nGpi1] [^1153CYPT] [^11261QAQ].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis and guideline stance before I overstate anything. Multiple international consensus statements and updated AANEM guidance support IVIG as a short-term therapy for MG exacerbations and crisis, with Class I evidence for acute worsening but insufficient evidence for stable chronic MG, which aligns with Cochrane reviews noting benefit in exacerbations but not in chronic disease; the 2025 Cochrane update suggests possible modest medium-term improvements versus placebo in sensitivity analyses, but certainty remains low to very low [^112WqmgM] [^114XisZB] [^114nosts] [^112umedX].

> I need to check dosing next. Standard regimens are 2 g/kg total dose, typically given as 1 g/kg daily for 2 consecutive days or 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days. A large randomized trial found no superiority of 2 g/kg over 1 g/kg given as a single day, so 1 g/kg once may suffice in some settings, though many centers still use 2 g/kg for maximal effect. Onset is usually within several days with peak benefit around 1–2 weeks and duration of benefit averaging roughly 4–8 weeks, though individual responses vary [^112BXDME] [^112T8hkv] [^111TecxD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about comparative efficacy versus plasma exchange. Head-to-head trials and systematic reviews indicate IVIG and plasma exchange have broadly similar short-term efficacy in moderate-to-severe exacerbations, with some signals that PLEX may work faster and be preferred in MuSK-positive MG; choice should be individualized by comorbidity, access, and speed of response needed, and sequential therapy can be considered in refractory cases [^113aJLc7] [^113Gcz43] [^112G94sK] [^112cZpzi].

> Let me consider maintenance therapy and steroid-sparing claims carefully. Historically, evidence for chronic IVIG has been limited to case series and retrospective cohorts suggesting steroid dose reductions and clinical stability. However, a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial did not show superiority of caprylate/chromatography-purified IVIG over placebo for achieving a 50% corticosteroid dose reduction, tempering enthusiasm for routine maintenance use. Guidelines permit consideration in refractory MG or when immunosuppressants are contraindicated, but high-quality evidence remains limited [^1139Vo8R] [^1153CYPT] [^11261QAQ] [^115hpkFw].

> I should double-check safety and contraindications before recommending IVIG. Common adverse effects include headache, flu-like symptoms, and mild hypertension; serious risks include thrombosis, aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, and renal dysfunction, particularly with sucrose-containing products or preexisting renal impairment; relative contraindications include hypercoagulable states, renal failure, and IgA deficiency, and pre-infusion checks for IgA levels and renal function are prudent; compared with plasma exchange, IVIG avoids central venous access and hemodynamic swings but may have a higher headache burden [^112T8hkv] [^11312Qnh] [^112umedX].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, IVIG is favored over teratogenic immunosuppressants when a rapid, temporary response is needed, with small series suggesting stabilization without exacerbations. In juvenile MG, IVIG may be used as an alternative to immunosuppressants given long-term steroid risks. In MuSK-positive MG, PLEX is often preferred over IVIG due to faster and more robust responses. Perioperative use can stabilize bulbar function before thymectomy or other surgeries [^115nGpi1] [^115BsBTZ] [^112G94sK] [^111ShcUj].

> But wait, what about integrating IVIG with newer targeted therapies. Complement inhibition with eculizumab and FcRn blockade with agents like efgartigimod and rozanolixizumab have expanded options; IVIG remains valuable as acute rescue and can be layered with these therapies, and emerging data suggest subcutaneous immunoglobulin may maintain stability after IVIG stabilization, though prospective maintenance RCTs are still limited; cost and access constraints often shape sequencing decisions in practice [^1139VfmR] [^113gFk4W] [^11765pPN] [^111PDS4Q].

> I will now examine a practical decision framework to ensure nothing is missed. For acute worsening with respiratory or bulbar involvement, choose IVIG or PLEX based on patient factors and availability, and initiate concomitant immunosuppression when appropriate. For preoperative stabilization or steroid initiation, IVIG can mitigate transient worsening. For refractory disease or intolerance to standard immunosuppressants, consider IVIG maintenance with shared decision-making about uncertain benefit and costs. Reassess at 2–4 weeks for efficacy and pivot to PLEX or add-on targeted therapy if inadequate response [^114XisZB] [^112WqmgM] [^112umedX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought IVIG might have a proven steroid-sparing effect based on earlier observational data, but I should correct that impression. The most rigorous RCT to date did not demonstrate superiority over placebo for corticosteroid tapering, so any maintenance or steroid-sparing role remains investigational and should be framed as such in counseling and shared decision-making [^1139Vo8R].

> Key takeaways I need to ensure are explicit: IVIG is a validated short-term therapy for MG exacerbations and crisis with onset in days and duration of weeks, appears broadly comparable to plasma exchange in AChR-positive disease with PLEX favored in MuSK-positive cases, has an acceptable safety profile with attention to thrombotic and renal risks, and has an evolving but still limited role in maintenance or steroid-sparing strategies pending stronger trials. Integration with complement and FcRn inhibitors can optimize outcomes in refractory patients [^112WqmgM] [^113Gcz43] [^112umedX] [^113gFk4W].

IVIG is used in myasthenia gravis for **acute exacerbations and myasthenic crisis** [^114XisZB] to rapidly improve strength and respiratory function, with onset in 2–5 days and peak effect by 1–2 weeks [^111TecxD]. It is **comparable to plasma exchange** for short-term improvement [^113aJLc7] and is favored when rapid IV access is needed or PLEX is contraindicated [^11312Qnh]. IVIG is also used preoperatively to stabilize bulbar function and as a bridge to steroid-sparing agents in refractory or steroid-dependent MG [^1156yKU1]. Typical dosing is 2 g/kg over 2–5 days; common adverse effects include headache, flu-like symptoms, and rare thrombotic or renal events [^112T8hkv] [^112umedX]. Evidence for chronic maintenance is limited; IVIG is reserved for refractory cases or when immunosuppressants are contraindicated [^1153CYPT] [^1139Vo8R].

## Clinical indications for IVIG in MG

IVIG is indicated in MG for **acute management and short-term stabilization**, with evidence strongest for exacerbations and crisis:

- **Acute exacerbations and myasthenic crisis**: IVIG is first-line for rapid improvement in severe weakness, respiratory compromise, or bulbar dysfunction [^11312Qnh] [^111B9ETw].

- **Preoperative stabilization**: Used before thymectomy or other surgeries in patients with significant bulbar dysfunction to reduce perioperative complications [^1156yKU1] [^111ShcUj].

- **Bridge therapy**: Provides transient improvement while initiating or optimizing chronic immunosuppressive therapy [^114XisZB] [^11312Qnh].

- **Refractory or steroid-dependent MG**: Considered when other immunosuppressants are contraindicated or ineffective [^1153CYPT] [^11261QAQ].

---

## Mechanism of action

IVIG exerts immunomodulatory effects via **multiple mechanisms**, including:

- **Fc receptor blockade**: Inhibits Fcγ receptor–mediated phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [^notfound].

- **Complement modulation**: Reduces complement activation and membrane attack complex formation [^116EyrHv].

- **Anti-idiotypic antibodies**: Neutralizes pathogenic autoantibodies, including anti-AChR antibodies [^111EEMN2].

- **Cytokine modulation**: Alters cytokine production and immune cell activation [^117VqPmG].

---

## Clinical efficacy

IVIG demonstrates **significant short-term efficacy** in MG exacerbations:

- **Acute exacerbations**: Improves strength and respiratory function within 2–5 days, peaking at 1–2 weeks [^111TecxD].

- **Comparison with plasma exchange**: Comparable short-term efficacy; choice depends on patient factors and availability [^113aJLc7] [^111B9ETw].

- **MuSK antibody-positive MG**: IVIG may be less effective than plasma exchange; PLEX is often preferred in this subtype [^112G94sK] [^113Gcz43].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

Common **IVIG dosing regimens** include:

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Duration** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard regimen | 2 g/kg total | 2–5 days | Acute exacerbations, myasthenic crisis |
| Alternative regimen | 1 g/kg daily | 2 consecutive days | Acute exacerbations |
| Maintenance therapy | 0.4–1 g/kg | Every 3–4 weeks | Refractory or steroid-dependent MG |

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

IVIG is **generally well tolerated**, but adverse effects can occur:

- **Common adverse effects**: Headache, flu-like symptoms, mild fever, chills, and fatigue [^112umedX].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare thrombotic events, renal dysfunction, aseptic meningitis, and anaphylaxis (particularly in IgA-deficient patients) [^112T8hkv].

- **Precautions**: Monitor renal function, fluid status, and thrombotic risk, especially in elderly or comorbid patients [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other immunomodulatory therapies

IVIG is **comparable to plasma exchange** for short-term improvement in acute MG, with similar efficacy and safety profiles [^113aJLc7]. Compared with corticosteroids, IVIG has a faster onset but does not confer long-term disease control; steroids remain essential for chronic management [^111B9ETw] [^112WqmgM] [^117B6Wvh]. Among newer agents, complement inhibitors (e.g. eculizumab) and FcRn antagonists (e.g. efgartigimod) offer targeted options for refractory MG, though long-term data are still evolving [^1139VfmR] [^113gFk4W].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Evidence for chronic maintenance is limited; **routine maintenance IVIG is not recommended** outside refractory cases or when immunosuppressants are contraindicated [^1153CYPT] [^1139Vo8R]. Cost and resource use are substantial, and cost-effectiveness remains debated, particularly compared with plasma exchange [^116yk3TR] [^1117oVVR]. Individual response varies, and predictors of response are not well defined, complicating patient selection [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **short-term use** of IVIG for acute management, with **individualized selection** based on patient factors and availability [^114XisZB] [^112hvfEi]. For long-term management, IVIG is reserved for refractory MG or when immunosuppressants are contraindicated, with ongoing monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects [^1153CYPT] [^11261QAQ].

---

IVIG is a **key short-term therapy** for MG exacerbations and crisis, offering rapid improvement with a favorable safety profile. It is comparable to plasma exchange and is used when rapid IV access is needed or PLEX is contraindicated. Chronic maintenance use is limited to refractory cases or when immunosuppressants are contraindicated, and evidence for long-term benefit remains limited.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^11578uBg]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) — IVIG efficacy and comparisons: In a Class I randomized controlled trial, 51 patients with worsening weakness were randomized to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 gm/kg divided over 2 days or placebo, yielding a change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score at 14 days of −2.54 versus −0.89 (p = .047), with benefit significant in moderate to severe disease. A Class I dose-optimization study for MG exacerbation randomized 173 patients to 2 gm/kg over 2 days versus 1 gm/kg on day 1 then placebo, showing mean improvement at 2 weeks of 19.3 points (95% CI 15.82 to 22.85) versus 15.49 points (95% CI 12.09 to 18.09) and headache 22.7% versus 13.1%. In a Class I comparison with plasma exchange (PLEX), 84 patients with QMG score > 10.5 received IVIG 2 gm/kg over 2 days or PLEX with 5% albumin every other day for 5 days, with responders 51% versus 57% (p = .5) and 20% (10 vs 8) requiring additional treatment. In corticosteroid-dependent MG, 60 patients were randomized to IVIG 2 gm/kg followed by 12 maintenance doses of 1 gm/kg every 3 weeks or placebo, with a 50% reduction at week 39 achieved by 60% versus 63% and only 38 patients (63%) completing; a 2012 Cochrane analysis concluded IVIG was beneficial in MG exacerbation with comparable efficacy to PLEX but with insufficient evidence in stable MG; overall, there is Class I evidence that IVIG is effective in treating MG exacerbation especially in those with moderate to severe disease.

### Targeting therapy to the neuromuscular junction: proof of concept [^115YKkms]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a prototypic antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, which fulfills strict criteria that define autoimmunity.MG is caused primarily by antibodies directed against the skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which is concentrated on the postsynaptic surface of the neuromuscular junction. The antibodies produce a reduction in AChR number and damage the muscle endplate. This leads to failure of neuromuscular transmission and produces weakness that may be life-threatening. AChR antibodies of patients with MG are polyclonal and recognize a complex epitope repertoire that differs among individuals. The heterogeneity of AChR antibodies among patients is increased further by the variety of light-chain and heavy-chain use. The antibody synthesis is T-cell–dependent, and the epitope repertoire of AChR CD4 + cells in MG patients is complex and characteristic of the individual. Due to extreme diversity of the immune response, specific suppression of autoantibody production is an elusive goal.

Therapies for MG fall into 2 broad categories,: those that focus on enhancing neuromuscular transmission by inhibition of cholinesterase, such as pyridostigmine; or agents that suppress or modulate the immune system, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Acute exacerbations of weakness are usually treated with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulins, which act primarily through removal of pathogenic antibody. All these treatments were developed after initial use in other disordersand produce systemic adverse effects. The immunotherapies are not aimed at production of the specific autoantibody in MG, but rather general moderation of all immune responses, whether this occurs through reduction of autoantibody levels directly or indirectly through suppression of B- and T-cell activity. The approach described here attempts inhibition of a final effector mechanism of pathogenic AChR antibody.

### How should newer therapeutic agents be incorporated into the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis? [^113gFk4W]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a postsynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder that results in fatigable muscle weakness. The traditional treatment approach includes the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and steroid-sparing immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs) for chronic management, whereas exacerbations and crises are managed with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PLEX). Over the past 6years, four new therapeutic agents with novel immunological mechanisms of action-complement and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) inhibition-were approved as a result of clinically significant improvement in gMG symptoms of those treated with these newer agents in Phase 3 clinical trials. At present, it is unclear when and in whom to initiate these therapeutic agents and how to integrate them into the current treatment paradigm. When selecting a newer therapeutic agent, we use a simple equation: Value = Clinical Improvement/(Cost + Side Effects + Treatment Burden), which guides our decision-making. We consider using these novel therapeutic agents in two specific clinical situations. Firstly, the newer agents are fast-acting, suggesting they can be used in clinically unstable patients as "bridge therapy", and secondly, they provide additional options for those patients considered treatment-refractory. There are downsides, however, including treatment cost, unique side effect profiles, and intravenous and subcutaneous drug administration (though for some, this may be an advantage). As additional drugs enter the marketplace with unique mechanisms of action, routes of administration, and dosing schedules, the placement of the novel therapeutic agents in the gMG treatment algorithm will likely evolve.

### Guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113XHvAC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). High credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange in MG/LEMS during COVID‑19 — evidence and use. There is currently no evidence to suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin or therapeutic plasma exchange carry additional risk of contracting COVID‑19. The use of IVIG has to be based on individual patient need and indiscriminate use should be avoided, and in general PLEX and IVIG should be reserved for acute exacerbations; some patients on maintenance therapy should continue with extra precautions related to travel. Targeted C5‑complement inhibition with eculizumab has no current evidence of increasing susceptibility to COVID‑19 infection or affecting its outcome.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^116M8bXx]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Eculizumab should be considered in the treatment of severe, refractory, AChR-Ab+ generalized MG (median 9, range 2–9).
The role of eculizumab in the treatment of MG is likely to evolve over time. Until further data become available to allow comparisons of cost and efficacy with other treatments, eculizumab should be considered after trials of other immunotherapies have been unsuccessful in meeting treatment goals (median 9, range 5–9).
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or other local guidelines regarding immunization against meningococcal meningitis should be followed before treatment with eculizumab (median 9, range 8–9).
Future research should include assessment of the duration of eculizumab therapy necessary to achieve and maintain treatment goals, its efficacy in other MG populations (MG with thymoma and seronegative MG), and in other stages of disease (MG crises, exacerbations, and early therapy in nonrefractory AChR-Ab+ MG) (median 8, range 4–9) (table e-2).

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^112hvfEi]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to IVIG, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to choose between IVIG and plasma exchange in patients with impending or manifest myasthenic crisis depending on individual patient factors (for example, plasma exchange cannot be used in patients with sepsis and IVIG cannot be used in hypercoagulable states, renal failure, or hypersensitivity to immunoglobulin) and other factors, including availability.

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the management of myasthenia gravis… [^111TecxD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Intravenous immunoglobulin, 400 mg/kg, was administered daily for five days to 12 patients with exacerbation of generalized myasthenia gravis. Degree of weakness, duration of illness, use of prednisone, and history of thymectomy or thymoma did not affect the response to intravenous immunoglobulin. Eleven patients improved, beginning 3. 6 ± 2. 7 days after the start of treatment and becoming maximal in
8. 6 ± 4. 6 days, with sustained improvement lasting 52 ± 37 days. Vital capacity increased from 1748 ± 510 to 2700 ± 614 mL at peak effect. Decreases in strength occurred in four patients beginning on day 3. 2 ± 2. 5, lasted

1. 5 ± 0. 6 days, and were mild in three patients. Other effects were minimal. There was no significant change in acetylcholine receptor antibody titers, which were elevated in all patients. Immunoglobulin seemed to produce a more rapid improvement than corticosteroids and is recommended as an adjunct in the management of myasthenia gravis exacerbations.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^1156yKU1]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to IVIG, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer IVIG as short-term treatment option in patients with MG in the following circumstances:

- life-threatening signs such as respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia

- preparation for surgery in patients with significant bulbar dysfunction

- a rapid response to treatment is needed

- other treatments are insufficiently effective

- before initiating corticosteroids if deemed necessary to prevent or minimize exacerbations.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for myasthenia gravis [^111vUACm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies interfere with neuromuscular transmission. As with other autoimmune diseases, people with myasthenia gravis would be expected to benefit from intravenous immunoglobulin.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin for treating exacerbations of myasthenia gravis or for chronic myasthenia gravis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (March 2005) and MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2005) using 'myasthenia gravis' and 'intravenous immunoglobulin' as the search terms.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised or quasi-randomised trials in which intravenous immunoglobulin was compared with no treatment, placebo or plasma exchange, in people with myasthenia gravis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted the data and the two others checked these data and the source from which they were derived. For methodological reasons, no formal meta-analysis was performed.

Main Results

We identified five randomised controlled trials, all of which investigated short-term benefit. The first study of 87 participants with exacerbation found no statistically significant difference between immunoglobulin and plasma exchange after two weeks. The second study of 12 participants with moderate or severe myasthenia gravis treated in a crossover design trial found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of immunoglobulin and plasma exchange after four weeks. The third study with 15 participants with mild or moderate myasthenia gravis found no statistically significant difference in efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin and placebo after six weeks. The fourth study terminated early. It included 33 participants with moderate exacerbations of myasthenia gravis and showed no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. The fifth trial including 173 people with myasthenia gravis exacerbations, showed no superiority of intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg on two consecutive days over intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg on a single day.

Authors' Conclusions

In severe exacerbations of myasthenia gravis, one randomised controlled trial did not show a significant difference between intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. Another showed no significant difference in efficacy between 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin. A further trial showed no significant difference between intravenous immunoglobulin and oral methylprednisolone. In chronic myasthenia gravis, there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether intravenous immunoglobulin is efficacious. More research is needed to determine whether intravenous immunoglobulin reduces the need for steroids as suggested by two case series.

### Medical costs of treating myasthenia gravis in patients who need intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)-a register-based study [^1117oVVR]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results illustrate that IVIg treatment is an important marker of direct medical costs associated with MG. Changes in these costs should be accounted for when evaluating new therapeutic interventions. IVIg patients are overrepresented among those with the highest direct medical costs, reflecting that these patients probably have a more severe disease. Innovative treatments for MG will likely become available in the coming years. Accurate information on the current standard of care is needed for the optimal assessment of new therapies. Good information ensures valid comparisons between old and new therapies. Our study presents new and important information regarding cost drivers and estimates to be used in models evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new treatments.

### Immunoglobulin for myasthenia gravis [^112umedX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Immunoglobulin has long been used to treat neuroimmunological conditions, including myasthenia gravis (MG). However, the evidence supporting its benefits in MG remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of immunoglobulin in people with generalized MG. Specifically, we aimed to compare 1) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) versus subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg), and 2) immunoglobulin administered via either route (irrespective of treatment duration, dosage, and regimen) versus no treatment, placebo, plasma exchange (PLEX), corticosteroids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or any other treatment.

Search Methods

On 17 September 2024, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to May 2022. Additionally, we reviewed the references of included studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IVIg with SCIg or immunoglobulin versus other interventions in participants with acute exacerbations or chronic active MG, undergoing steroid tapering, or preparing for surgery. We excluded trials without a comparison group.

Outcomes

We measured critical outcomes over three time intervals: short-term (up to two weeks), medium-term (2 to 24 weeks), and long-term (beyond 24 weeks). They included physician-evaluated change in severity of symptoms and signs, measured by scales such as the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and the Myasthenia Muscle Score (MMS); patient-reported change in functional capacity, measured by scales such as the MG Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale, the MG Quality of Life (MG-QOL), and MG-QOL15 questionnaire, and change in measures that incorporate both physician-evaluated and patient-reported items, such as the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scale. Prioritized important outcomes were length of hospitalization, incidence of MG-related hospitalizations, and specific treatment-related adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool (and its extension for cross-over trials) to assess the risk of bias.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted meta-analyses for each of the possible comparisons using a random-effects model when different scales were used for the measurement of the same outcome or when studies in an analysis included different types of participants. We calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, and risk differences (RDs) for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 12 RCTs (11 with usable data; 515 participants) conducted between 1997 and 2025 in Europe, North America, and Asia. All studies assessed IVIg; none assessed SCIg. Comparators included PLEX (six trials), placebo (five trials), and corticosteroids (one trial).

Synthesis Of Results

IVIg versus placebo IVIg did not differ from placebo in physician-evaluated medium-term change in symptom severity. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding one high-risk study showed a small improvement in the QMG score with IVIg (MD -1.86, 95% CI -3.44 to -0.29; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 113 participants; low-certainty evidence), though this did not reach the commonly used threshold for clinical significance. Similarly, we found no difference in patient-reported medium-term change in functional capacity, but a sensitivity analysis excluding one high-risk study showed improvement in the MG-QOL15 score with IVIg (MD -5.50, 95% CI -9.80 to -1.20; 1 study, 62 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no differences in medium-term change in the MGC scale, length of hospitalization, or MG-related hospitalizations. IVIg increased the incidence of headache compared to placebo (RD 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61; I² = 59%; 4 studies, 188 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of three people. No data were available for hypotension requiring vascular expansion. Immunoglobulin versus PLEX IVIg and PLEX did not differ in physician-evaluated short-term change in symptom severity. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding high-risk studies showed a smaller improvement in the QMG score with IVIg compared to PLEX (MD 2.92, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.41; I² = 81%; 2 studies, 124 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no difference in patient-reported short-term change in functional capacity. We found no data for combined measures (e.g. MGC). IVIg was associated with longer hospital stays than PLEX (MD 2.90, 95% CI 2.58 to 3.22; 1 study, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence), while no MG-related hospitalizations occurred. No significant differences were found in adverse events, including hypotension requiring vascular expansion, and headache. Immunoglobulin versus corticosteroids We observed no difference between IVIg and corticosteroids in physician-evaluated short-term change in symptom severity, assessed with the QMG score (MD -0.66, 95% CI -2.58 to 1.26; 1 study, 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for patient-reported changes in functional capacity, combined measures, length of hospitalization, MG-related hospitalizations, or adverse events. Certainty of evidence The certainty of evidence was often low or very low, primarily due to study limitations (risk of bias), small sample sizes, inconsistency, and imprecision. No eligible studies compared IVIg with SCIg or with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that IVIg may improve symptoms and functional capacity in the medium term in people with MG, compared to placebo, though the effects did not reach commonly used thresholds for clinical significance and were based on sensitivity analyses. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, IVIg probably also increases the incidence of headache. Based on very low to low-certainty evidence, IVIg may be less beneficial than PLEX for short-term improvement in symptoms and may prolong hospital stay, though we found no differences in adverse events. No firm conclusions can be drawn for the comparison of IVIg with corticosteroids. Overall, due to the low or very low certainty of evidence, high-quality trials are needed, including evaluations of SCIg and newer therapies.

### Therapeutic options in autoimmune myasthenia gravis [^117CJcW2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) is associated with circulating antibodies to AChR, modification of the synaptic cleft, and destruction of the postsynaptic neuromuscular membrane. The hallmark is fluctuating muscular weakness and fatigability of muscles on sustained repeated activity. Various drugs and invasive procedures have been used in the treatment of MG including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, etanercept, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and thymectomy. We review the role of each of these drugs and invasive procedures in MG. Although current treatment is highly successful and mortality is almost nil, further trials are required to identify the most suitable treatments for different subgroups of MG patients. In addition, safer and more potent drugs are required as most current drugs have major side effects due to immunosuppression. Therefore, the goal of novel therapies should be increased specificity of the immune-directed agents.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^115Kj6TJ]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update the 2016 formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) based on the latest evidence in the literature.

Methods

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to develop consensus recommendations pertaining to 7 treatment topics. In February 2019, the international panel was reconvened with the addition of one member to represent South America. All previous recommendations were reviewed for currency, and new consensus recommendations were developed on topics that required inclusion or updates based on the recent literature. Up to 3 rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to reach consensus, with modifications to recommendations between rounds based on the panel input. A simple majority vote (80% of panel members voting "yes") was used to approve minor changes in grammar and syntax to improve clarity.

Results

The previous recommendations for thymectomy were updated. New recommendations were developed for the use of rituximab, eculizumab, and methotrexate as well as for the following topics: early immunosuppression in ocular MG and MG associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

Conclusion

This updated formal consensus guidance of international MG experts, based on new evidence, provides recommendations to clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

### Phase 2 trial in acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive myasthenia gravis of transition from intravenous to subcutaneous immunoglobulin: the MGSCIg study [^11765pPN]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Data on maintenance therapy with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) in myasthenia gravis (MG) are limited. We report on transitioning acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive (Ab+) MG patients on stable intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) regimens as part of routine clinical care to SCIg 1:1.2.

Methods

This multicenter North American open-label prospective investigator-initiated study had two components: the IVIg Stabilization Period (ISP) enrolling patients already on IVIg as part of routine clinical care (Weeks -10 to -1), followed by transition of stable MG subjects to SCIg in the Experimental Treatment Period (ETP; Weeks 0 to 12). We hypothesized that > 65% of patients entering the ETP would have a stable Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score from Week 0 to Week 12. Secondary outcome measures included other efficacy measures, safety, tolerability, IgG levels, and treatment satisfaction.

Results

We recruited 23 patients in the ISP, and 22 entered the ETP. A total of 12 subjects (54.5%) were female, and 18 (81.8%) were White, with mean age 51.4 ± 17years. We obtained Week 12 ETP QMG data on 19 of 22; one subject withdrew from ETP owing to clinical deterioration, and two subjects withdrew due to dislike of needles. On primary analysis, 19 of 22 participants (86.4%, 95% confidence interval = 0.72–1.00) were treatment successes using last observation carried forward (p = 0.018). Secondary efficacy measures supported MG stability. SCIg was safe and well tolerated, and IgG levels were stable. Treatment satisfaction was comparable between ISP and ETP.

Conclusions

MG patients on IVIg as part of their routine clinical care remained stable on monthly IVIg dosage, and most maintained similar disease stability on SCIg.

### EFNS guidelines for the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in treatment of neurological diseases: EFNS task force on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in treatment of neurological diseases [^111apGkn]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is widely used in treatment of a number of immune-mediated neurological diseases, the consensus on its optimal use is insufficient. To define the evidence-based optimal use of IVIG in neurology, the recent papers of high relevance were reviewed and consensus recommendations are given according to EFNS guidance regulations. The efficacy of IVIG has been proven in Guillain-Barré syndrome (level A), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (level A), multifocal mononeuropathy (level A), acute exacerbations of myasthenia gravis (MG) and short-term treatment of severe MG (level A recommendation), and some paraneoplastic neuropathies (level B). IVIG is recommended as a second-line treatment in combination with prednisone in dermatomyositis (level B) and treatment option in polymyositis (level C). IVIG should be considered as a second or third-line therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, if conventional immunomodulatory therapies are not tolerated (level B), and in relapses during pregnancy or post-partum period (good clinical practice point). IVIG seems to have a favourable effect also in paraneoplastic neurological diseases (good practice point), stiff-person syndrome (level A), some acute-demyelinating diseases and childhood refractory epilepsy (good practice point).

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for myasthenia gravis [^113nBDro]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies interfere with neuromuscular transmission. As with other autoimmune diseases, people with myasthenia gravis would be expected to benefit from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).

Objectives

The objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin for treating exacerbations of myasthenia gravis or for chronic myasthenia gravis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease GroupTrials Register (April 2007) and MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2007) using 'myasthenia gravis' and 'intravenous immunoglobulin' as the search terms.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised or quasi-randomised trials in which intravenous immunoglobulin was compared with no treatment, placebo or plasma exchange, in people with myasthenia gravis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted the data and two others checked these data and the source from which they were derived. For methodological reasons, no formal meta-analysis was performed.

Main Results

We identified six randomised controlled trials, all of which investigated short-term benefit. A trial of IVIg compared with placebo including 51 patients provided evidence for the effectiveness of IVIg in myasthenia gravis worsening. A study of 87 participants with exacerbation found no statistically significant difference between immunoglobulin and plasma exchange after two weeks. A study of 12 participants with moderate or severe myasthenia gravis treated in a crossover design trial found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of immunoglobulin and plasma exchange after four weeks. A study with 15 participants with mild or moderate myasthenia gravis found no statistically significant difference in efficacy of IVIg and placebo after six weeks. A study included 33 participants with moderate exacerbations of myasthenia gravis and showed no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of IVIg and methylprednisolone. The last trial including 173 people with myasthenia gravis exacerbations, showed no superiority of IVIg 1 g/kg on two consecutive days over IVIg 1 g/kg on a single day.

Authors' Conclusions

In exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, one randomised controlled trial of IVIg versus placebo demonstrated the efficacy of IVIg and another did not show a significant difference between IVIg and plasma exchange. Another showed no significant difference in efficacy between 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg of IVIg. A further, but underpowered, trial showed no significant difference between IVIg and oral methylprednisolone. In chronic myasthenia gravis, there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether IVIg is efficacious. More research is needed to determine whether IVIg reduces the need for corticosteroids as suggested by two case series.

1 INTRODUCTION

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been proven safe and effective for several conditions: primary immunodeficiency, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and other indications in various countries. IVIG has also been shown to be efficacious for short‐term treatment of acute exacerbations of myasthenia gravis (MG). However, IVIG maintenance therapy for MG has not been extensively studied.

IVIG can improve strength in patients with MG and is used as rescue therapy for MG exacerbation and crisis, but data supporting the efficacy of IVIG as maintenance therapy for MG are lacking. Although there have been several studies assessing the efficacy of IVIG in MG in acute, and maintenance settings, few have been controlled trials with none in the maintenance setting. These controlled trials involved small numbers of patients (n = 12 and n = 15) and have limitations (e.g. premature termination due to lack of IVIGor a crossover design with plasma exchange). There is still a need for prospective, randomized, controlled trials of IVIG as acute and maintenance therapy in MG.

This is a prospective, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of IVIG maintenance therapy in MG. In the current study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of immune globulin 10% caprylate/chromatography purified (IGIV‐C) in symptomatic patients with generalized MG (gMG) being treated with standard‐of‐care therapy.

### Efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin in neurological diseases [^115TqjHA]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Owing to its anti-inflammatory efficacy in various autoimmune disease conditions, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)-pooled IgG obtained from the plasma of several thousands individuals-has been used for nearly three decades and is proving to be efficient in a growing number of neurological diseases. IVIG therapy has been firmly established for the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy, either as first-line therapy or adjunctive treatment. IVIG is also recommended as rescue therapy in patients with worsening myasthenia gravis and is beneficial as a second-line therapy for dermatomyositis and stiff-person syndrome. Subcutaneous rather than intravenous administration of IgG is gaining momentum because of its effectiveness in patients with primary immunodeficiency and the ease with which it can be administered independently from hospital-based infusions. The demand for IVIG therapy is growing, resulting in rising costs and supply shortages. Strategies to replace IVIG with recombinant products have been developed based on proposed mechanisms that confer the anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG, but their efficacy has not been tested in clinical trials. This review covers new developments in the immunobiology and clinical applications of IVIG in neurological diseases.

### Changes in quality of life scores with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis in patients with myasthenia gravis [^114ozYwE]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasmapheresis (plasma exchange (PLEX)) have comparable efficacy in reducing the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score for disease severity (QMGS) in patients with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis (MG).

Objective

To determine if the improvement in the quality of life (QOL) after immunomodulation is comparable with either IVIG or PLEX.

Methods

62 patients participated in the MG-QOL-60 study, completing the questionnaire at baseline and at day 14 after treatment. The MG-QOL-15 scores were computed from the MG-QOL-60 questionnaire responses. We analysed the change in the QOL scores from baseline to day 14 in both treatment groups.

Results

The scores in both QOL scales decreased at day 14 in the IVIG and PLEX groups, without significant difference between groups (QOL-15: IVIG -5.7 ± 8.5, PLEX: -7.0 ± 7.6, p = 0.52; QOL-60: IVIG -13.3 ± 16.9, PLEX -18.5 ± 22.0, p = 0.41). The improvement in QOL showed a good correlation with the decrease in QMGS. There was an excellent correlation between the MG-QOL-15 and MG-QOL-60 scores at baseline and at day 14.

Conclusions

This study of MG-QOL changes supports recent findings that IVIG and PLEX are comparable in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe MG and worsening symptoms. Furthermore, our study supports the use of the MG-QOL-15 as a secondary outcome measure in future clinical trials in MG.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG)

MG, characterized by fluctuating weakness or fatigability of the extraocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb muscles, is mediated by pathogenic antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in 85% of the patients; up to 5–7% of patients are seronegative, while another 5% have anti Musk antibodies. Patients with MG respond fairly well to anticholinesterases, steroids, and immunosuppressants. Plasmapheresis is effective for crises or severe exacerbations; the same is true for IVIg in treating exacerbations in lieu of plasmapheresis. In two randomized trials, IVIg was as effective as plasmapheresis at day 15, either at 1 g/kg or 2 g/kg. IVIg is also superior to placebo, 14 days after therapy, in patients with moderate to severe MG and "worsening weakness". A recent prospective non-randomized study in 49 patients with MG exacerbations confirmed the efficacy of 2 g/kg of IVIg observed 14 days after the infusion, but without any new data beyond the 30-day period. The AChR antibody titers may decline or remain unchanged; in vitro, IVIg inhibits AChR antibody activity up to 30% of the preincubation level. Subcutaneous IgG is also effective in uncontrolled series for relapses up to 4–6 weeks. At present, IVIg is justified in lieu of plasmapheresis for acutely worsening disease to prevent or minimize impending bulbar or respiratory failure, prepare a clinically weak patient for thymectomy or on a short-term basis to help significant worsening. The role of IVIg in the chronic management of MG or as a steroid-sparing agent has not been established in prospective randomized trials. Unfortunately, IVIg is often being off-label used, in lieu of steroids and immunosuppressants, for chronic therapy to maintain stability or reduce the uncertainty of possible exacerbations without evidence of cost-effective benefit. Considering its ineffectiveness in IgG4 antibodies, IVIg is not substantially helping Musk-positive MG because it has no effect on IgG4 antibodies as discussed later. IVIg has been effective in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, based on a small placebo-controlled study that improved muscle strength compared to placebo 2–4 weeks after therapy. No long-term benefits have been established in controlled studies.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^113dZFRL]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

All recommendations below achieved panel consensus agreement as being appropriate, and these recommendations should be considered extensions or additions to recommendations made in the initial international consensus guidance. The range outside of the "appropriate" category (7–9) indicates the breadth of opinions (dispersion) within the panel.

Thymectomy

The multicenter, randomized, rater-blinded trial of thymectomy in MG (MGTX) enrolled patients younger than 65 years with AChR-positive (AChR-Ab+) generalized nonthymomatous MG of < 5 years duration. Sixty-six subjects underwent extended transsternal thymectomy and received prednisone using a standard dosing schedule, whereas 60 subjects received the standardized prednisone dosing schedule alone. An effect favoring thymectomy was seen in both of the coprimary outcome measures: reductions in the time-weighted average quantitative MG (QMG) score and the time-weighted average alternate-day prednisone dose. Secondary outcome measures, including azathioprine use, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) use, and hospitalizations for MG exacerbations, also favored thymectomy plus prednisone. Benefits were seen within the first year and were sustained through year 3. In a post hoc analysis, neither the prednisone dose nor QMG scores were significantly different between the 2 treatment groups in patients 50 years or older. An extension of the MGTX trial followed 68 (61%) participants from the original trial for 2 additional years. At 60 months, lower time-weighted average QMG scores and a reduction in average time-weighted prednisone dose favored thymectomy plus prednisone. A recent AAN Practice Advisory recommended that clinicians should discuss thymectomy with patients with AChR-Ab+ generalized MG and should counsel patients considering minimally invasive thymectomy techniques that it is uncertain whether the benefit attained by extended transsternal thymectomy will also be attained by minimally invasive approaches (level B).

IVIg and PLEX.

1. PLEX and IVIg are appropriately used as short-term treatments in patients with MG with life-threatening signs such as respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia; in preparation for surgery in patients with significant bulbar dysfunction; when a rapid response to treatment is needed; when other treatments are insufficiently effective; and prior to beginning corticosteroids if deemed necessary to prevent or minimize exacerbations.
2. The choice between PLEX and IVIg depends on individual patient factors (e.g. PLEX cannot be used in patients with sepsis and IVIg cannot be used in renal failure) and on the availability of each.
3. IVIg and PLEX are probably equally effective in the treatment of severe generalized MG.
4. The efficacy of IVIg is less certain in milder MG or in ocular MG.
5. PLEX may be more effective than IVIg in MuSK-MG.
6. The use of IVIg as maintenance therapy can be considered for patients with refractory MG or for those in whom IS agents are relatively contraindicated.

### Randomized, controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin in myasthenia gravis [^117KyCBg]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

We initiated a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment in myasthenia gravis (MG). Patients received IVIG 2 gm/kg at induction and 1 gm/kg after 3 weeks vs. 5% albumin placebo. The primary efficacy measurement was the change in the quantitative MG Score (QMG) at day 42. Fifteen patients were enrolled (6 to IVIG; 9 to placebo) before the study was terminated because of insufficient IVIG inventories. At day 42, there was no significant difference in primary or secondary outcome measurements between the two groups. In a subsequent 6-week open-label study of IVIG, positive trends were observed.

### Chronic immunoglobulin maintenance therapy in myasthenia gravis [^115od8Gm]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Long-term treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) includes symptomatic and course-modifying therapies that target the immune system. Recently, both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) have emerged as viable options for chronic therapy, considering the favourable safety-efficacy profile and possible immunosuppressant sparing properties. The aim was to investigate the outcomes of the long-term care of generalized MG with immunoglobulin (Ig).

Methods

This is a retrospective, repeated-measures design study. Charts of generalized MG patients, treated with IVIG/SCIG for at least 6 months, from January 2015 to January 2020, were analysed. The primary outcome was the mean change in Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index (MGII) after treatment with Ig, comparing baseline to IVIG and SCIG treatment periods. Secondary outcomes included the changes in pyridostigmine, immunosuppressive medications and patient-reported outcome 'percentage of normal' (0%-100%).

Results

Thirty-four patients were treated with chronic Ig therapy (30 IVIG/SCIG, three SCIG, one IVIG). The mean durations of IVIG and SCIG periods were 21.8 ± 19.4 (range 3–64) months and 19.5 ± 11.3 (range 5–45) months respectively. There was a significant reduction in MGII scores (27.7 ± 15.7 baseline; 22.0 ± 17.4 IVIG period; 19.5 ± 18.1 SCIG period; F = 17.9; d.f. = 1.7; P < 0.01), pyridostigmine and immunosuppressant use (P = 0.00). The outcome 'percentage of normal' had a significant positive association with both treatments (P = 0.00).

Conclusion

Our study results suggest that patients can be successfully transitioned to IVIG and from IVIG to SCIG in the chronic treatment of generalized MG with reductions in impairments and use of other medications and improvement in overall status with Ig therapy. Prospective, randomized studies are needed to clarify costs and comparative effectiveness.

### Safety and efficacy of eculizumab in anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive refractory generalised myasthenia gravis (REGAIN): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study [^1139VfmR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Complement is likely to have a role in refractory generalised myasthenia gravis, but no approved therapies specifically target this system. Results from a phase 2 study suggested that eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, produced clinically meaningful improvements in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive refractory generalised myasthenia gravis. We further assessed the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in this patient population in a phase 3 trial.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (REGAIN) in 76 hospitals and specialised clinics in 17 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with a Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score of 6 or more, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class II-IV disease, vaccination against Neisseria meningitides, and previous treatment with at least two immunosuppressive therapies or one immunosuppressive therapy and chronic intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange for 12 months without symptom control. Patients with a history of thymoma or thymic neoplasms, thymectomy within 12 months before screening, or use of intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange within 4 weeks before randomisation, or rituximab within 6 months before screening, were excluded. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either intravenous eculizumab or intravenous matched placebo for 26 weeks. Dosing for eculizumab was 900 mg on day 1 and at weeks 1, 2, and 3; 1200 mg at week 4; and 1200 mg given every second week thereafter as maintenance dosing. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice or web-response system with patients stratified to one of four groups based on MGFA disease classification. Where possible, patients were maintained on existing myasthenia gravis therapies and rescue medication was allowed at the study physician's discretion. Patients, investigators, staff, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 26 in MG-ADL total score measured by worst-rank ANCOVA. The efficacy population set was defined as all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one dose of study drug, had a valid baseline MG-ADL assessment, and at least one post-baseline MG-ADL assessment. The safety analyses included all randomly assigned patients who received eculizumab or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01997229.

Findings

Between April 30, 2014, and Feb 19, 2016, we randomly assigned and treated 125 patients, 62 with eculizumab and 63 with placebo. The primary analysis showed no significant difference between eculizumab and placebo (least-squares mean rank 56.6 [SEM 4.5] vs 68.3 [4.5]; rank-based treatment difference -11.7, 95% CI -24.3 to 0.96; p = 0.0698). No deaths or cases of meningococcal infection occurred during the study. The most common adverse events in both groups were headache and upper respiratory tract infection (ten [16%] for both events in the eculizumab group and 12 [19%] for both in the placebo group). Myasthenia gravis exacerbations were reported by six (10%) patients in the eculizumab group and 15 (24%) in the placebo group. Six (10%) patients in the eculizumab group and 12 (19%) in the placebo group required rescue therapy.

Interpretation

The change in the MG-ADL score was not statistically significant between eculizumab and placebo, as measured by the worst-rank analysis. Eculizumab was well tolerated. The use of a worst-rank analytical approach proved to be an important limitation of this study since the secondary and sensitivity analyses results were inconsistent with the primary endpoint result; further research into the role of complement is needed.

### Maintenance immunosuppression in myasthenia gravis [^111pRdmJ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Therapies for myasthenia gravis (MG) include symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatment. Options for immunosuppression include corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and thymectomy. The practical aspects of long-term immunosuppressive therapy in MG will be critically reviewed in this article. Treatment for ocular and generalized myasthenia gravis will be discussed. Application of these therapies needs to be considered in conjunction with their efficacy, disease subtypes and severity, and patient co-morbidities.

- Corticosteroids have been useful in the management of myasthenia gravis, but their efficacy has been limited by the slow onset of improvement, initial worsening of MG, refractoriness of some patients, and side effects of large daily doses. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone pulses have been reported to produce rapid improvement in several immunologic disorders. In this study we administered 2 g of methylprednisolone intravenously every five days to 15 consecutive patients who had exacerbation of generalized MG. Satisfactory improvement occurred in ten of 15 patients after two courses and in two of five patients after a third course. Onset of improvement began a mean of 3 ± 1. 1 days after the first infusion,
2. 1 ± 1 days after the second, and 2. 4 ± 1 days after the third, and reached its maximum level
8. 9 ± 6. 1 days after the last infusion. A decrease in strength occurred in three patients 1. 43 ±

1.

30 days after each infusion, was not marked, and lasted three days, following which improvement generally occurred. Side effects were minimal. After improvement, a daily dose of prednisone was used to maintain improvement. Use of pulse therapy at five-day intervals for the management of severe MG seems to have an advantage in that it produces less initial worsening and more rapid improvement in MG, enabling smaller daily maintenance doses to be employed, with fewer side effects.

Management of myasthenia gravis

Initial management of myasthenia gravis depends on the clinical severity of the disease at presentation. Myasthenia gravis crises typically present with severe bulbar or respiratory involvement, or rapidly progressive disease; these are managed as inpatient cases, with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg; antibodies taken from the blood of healthy donors) or plasma exchange (removal of the affected person's plasma, which is the part of the blood that contains antibodies, and replacing it with donated plasma), along with respiratory support in the hospital intensive care unit if required. Management of myasthenia gravis in people who are not in crisis can be initiated in the outpatient setting. The initial treatment of choice is typically a medication called pyridostigmine, with the addition of oral prednisolone (a type of steroid treatment) if the person remains symptomatic. Immunosuppression is generally reserved for those who do not achieve remission on prednisolone therapy, or who experience relapse (return of their myasthenia gravis symptoms) on prednisolone withdrawal. Azathioprine is typically used as the first‐line immunosuppressive agent, while other options include mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and ciclosporin. In difficult‐to‐treat cases, a medication called rituximab can be used, which acts to deplete the cells of the immune system that produce antibodies (known as B cells). Response to rituximab is better in people with MuSK antibody‐positive myasthenia gravis compared with those with AChR antibody‐positive myasthenia gravis, and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of rituximab as an add‐on therapy to prednisolone treatment for myasthenia gravis did not demonstrate a clinically meaningful steroid‐sparing effect at 12 months compared with prednisolone plus placebo. If imaging shows evidence of a thymoma, it should be removed as this can result in spontaneous remission of myasthenia gravis (complete resolution of the symptoms of myasthenia gravis). Additionally, in people without a thymoma who are under 65 years and AChR antibody‐positive, there is evidence that thymus removal can reduce their myasthenia gravis medication requirements.

Abstract

Introduction/Aims

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) maintenance therapy in myasthenia gravis (MG) are lacking. In this trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of caprylate/chromatography‐purified IVIG; (IGIV‐C) in patients with generalized MG undergoing standard care.

Methods

Sixty‐two patients enrolled in this phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized trial (1:1 IGIV‐C [2 g/kg loading dose; 1 g/kg every 3 weeks through week 21] or placebo). Efficacy was assessed by changes in Quantitative MG (QMG) score at week 24 versus baseline (primary endpoint) and percentage of patients with clinical improvement in QMG, MG Composite (MGC), and MG‐Activities of Daily Living (MG‐ADL) scores (secondary endpoints). Safety assessments reported all adverse events (AEs).

Results

The change in QMG at 24 weeks was −5.1 for IGIV‐C and −3.1 for placebo (p = .187). Seventy percent of patients in the IGIV‐C group had improvement in MG‐ADL (≥ 2‐point decrease) versus 40.6% in the placebo group (p = .025). Patients showing clinical improvement in QMG and MGC (≥ 3‐point decrease) were 70.0% for IGIV‐C versus 59.4% for placebo (p = .442) and 60.0% for IGIV‐C versus 53.1% for placebo (p = .610). IGIV‐C was well tolerated; serious AEs were similar between arms. Three of four MG exacerbations requiring hospitalizations occurred in the IGIV‐C arm with one death.

Discussion

Several efficacy parameters showed numerical results greater than those seen in the placebo group. This was a small study and may have been underpowered to see significant differences. Additional studies may be warranted to fully determine the efficacy of IVIG maintenance therapy in MG.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for myasthenia gravis [^116wJdbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. In up to 90 per cent of cases IgG autoantibodies to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are detectable which mediate the neuromuscular transmission disorder. As with other autoimmune diseases, patients would be expected to benefit from intravenous immunoglobulin. Case series and two randomised controlled trials suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin may be beneficial.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to examine the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin for treating exacerbations of myasthenia gravis or for chronic myasthenia gravis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (21 July 2002) and MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2002) using 'myasthenia gravis' and 'intravenous immunoglobulin' as the search terms.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials in which intravenous immunoglobulin was compared with no treatment, placebo or plasma exchange, in people with myasthenia gravis who were diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted the data and the two others checked these data and the source from which they were derived. For methodological reasons, no formal meta-analysis was performed.

Main Results

We identified four randomised controlled trials (147 participants in total), all investigating short-term benefit. In the first study of 87 people with myasthenia gravis exacerbation, comparing intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, there was no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of the two treatments after two weeks. In the second study 12 people with moderate or severe myasthenia gravis were treated in a cross-over design trial with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange: no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of the two treatments was found after four weeks. In the third study 15 people with mild or moderate myasthenia gravis received intravenous immunoglobulin or a placebo: no significant difference in efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin or placebo was found six weeks after treatment. The last study, which included 33 people with moderate exacerbations of myasthenia gravis, compared intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone and showed no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of the two treatments.

Reviewer's Conclusions

One randomised controlled trial did not show a significant difference between intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange for treatment of severe exacerbations of myasthenia gravis. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether intravenous immunoglobulin for moderate or severe myasthenia gravis improves functional outcome or has a sparing effect on steroid dosage, nor is there sufficient evidence to favour intravenous immunoglobulin over steroids in moderate exacerbations. Further randomised controlled trials are needed.

### Treatment of myasthenia gravis exacerbation with intravenous immunoglobulin… [^112BXDME]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The optimal dose of intravenous immunoglobulin in acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis remains unknown. Increasing the treatment duration might provide added efficacy. Objective To determine the optimal dose of IVIG for treating myasthenia gravis exacerbation. Design Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial designed to demonstrate superiority of the 2 g/kg dose over the 1 g/kg dose of IVIG, conducted between November 13, 1996, and October 26, 2002. Participants One hundred seventy-three patients aged 15 to 85 years with acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 g/kg of IVIG on day 1 and placebo on day 2 vs 1 g/kg of IVIG on 2 consecutive days. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. Up to 90% of patients with generalized MG have detectable serum anti–acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

Skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability that fluctuate rapidly or slowly are the characteristic symptoms. Acute exacerbation can cause life-threatening swallowing impairment or respiratory failure. Myasthenic exacerbation was defined as development within the last month of at least 1 of the following symptoms: difficulty swallowing, acute respiratory failure, and major functional disability precluding physical activity. At baseline, the disease duration, number of previous exacerbations, presence of thymoma, history of thymectomy, and current treatment were recorded. Clinical severity before the exacerbation was graded as follows: grade 1, complete remission; grade 2, minor symptoms allowing normal everyday physical activities; grade 3, moderate symptoms allowing part-time work or some daily activities; grade 4, major disability requiring discontinuation of work; and grade 5, major disability requiring continuous help from others or mechanical ventilation.

Our results show no significant superiority of 2 g/kg compared with 1 g/kg of IV immunoglobulin infused on a single day in patients with exacerbation of MG, although there was a slight trend toward superiority of 2 g/kg. The 95% CI of the effect size for the MMS change was –1. 03 to
8. 71; therefore, the MMS change with 2 g/kg of IVIG was between −1. 03 and
8. 71 points, with a 5% type I error.

Impending and manifest myasthenic crisis.

Impending and manifest myasthenic crisis are emergent situations requiring aggressive management and supportive care.

Although cholinergic crises are now rare, excessive ChEI cannot be completely excluded as a cause of clinical worsening. Also, ChEIs increase airway secretions, which may exacerbate breathing difficulties.

PLEX and IVIg are the mainstay of management in myasthenic crisis.

1. Impending crisis requires hospital admission and close observation of respiratory and bulbar function, with the ability to transfer to an intensive care unit if it progresses to manifest crisis. Myasthenic crisis requires admission to an intensive care or step-down unit to monitor for or manage respiratory failure and bulbar dysfunction.
2. PLEX and IVIg are used as short-term treatment for impending and manifest myasthenic crisis and in patients with significant respiratory or bulbar dysfunction. Corticosteroids or other IS agents are often started at the same time to achieve a sustained clinical response. (Because corticosteroids may cause transient worsening of myasthenic weakness, it may be appropriate to wait several days for PLEX or IVIg to have a beneficial effect before starting corticosteroids).
3. Although clinical trials suggest that IVIg and PLEX are equally effective in the treatment of impending or manifest myasthenic crisis, expert consensus suggests that PLEX is more effective and works more quickly. The choice between the 2 therapies depends on patient comorbidity (e.g. PLEX cannot be used in sepsis and IVIg is contraindicated in hypercoagulable states, renal failure, or hypersensitivity to immunoglobulin) and other factors, including availability. A greater risk of hemodynamic and venous access complications with PLEX should also be considered in the decision (many complications of PLEX are related to route of access and may be minimized by using peripheral rather than central venous access).

MG crisis

Myasthenic crisis is a serious exacerbation of MG, where ventilatory or bulbar dysfunction causes an imminent threat of death due to respiratory failure, and intubation or non‐invasive ventilation is needed. A retrospective study of 815 patients found severe MG at diagnosis, thymoma, and MuSK antibodies to be risk factors. In a study of 250 MG patients requiring mechanical ventilation, advanced age, onset after age 50 years, severe MG at debut, and comorbidities increased the risk for need of mechanical ventilation for over 15 days. Myasthenic crisis occurs in around 10% of patients with generalized MG within the first 2 years from diagnosis, with a mortality rate of 5%–10%. The respiratory capacity can drop quickly and continuous observation in hospital is necessary during severe MG exacerbations. Vital capacity and blood gas examinations do not reliably predict the need for respiratory support.

Immediate and optimal management of the airways with respiratory and circulatory support is essential. Pyridostigmine should be discontinued during a crisis to prevent increased mucus secretion and plugging of the airways, and restarted before weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The two first‐line treatments, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin, have similar efficacy according to two well‐controlled trials. A systematic review and meta‐analysis indicated a slightly higher response rate and faster clinical improvement with plasma exchange. An experienced team reduces side effects and complications. When a prolonged and severe crisis is expected, a sequential combination of both treatments is superior, with plasma exchange being given first so as not to wash out the immunoglobulins. Intravenous immunoglobulin dose is usually 2 g/kg body weight as a total dose given over 3–5 consecutive days. Selective plasma exchange with specific immunoadsorption is possible but is not widely used and does not have a better effect. Very high doses of corticosteroids can be used as add‐on therapy in intensive care (prednisone 3–4 mg/kg or parenteral methylprednisolone 500 mg per day). This treatment is recommended in case of a delayed (> 1 week) or insufficient response to the primary therapy.

Recommendations

Early signs of a myasthenic crisis should lead to immediate intensive care unit admission.
Plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are the primary treatments recommended for crisis. The choice should be made based on availability and individual patient assessment.
After a myasthenic crisis, the immunotherapy should usually be intensified with increased drug doses and/or additional drugs.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin maintenance treatment in myasthenia gravis: a randomized, controlled trial sample size simulation [^114eCAjS]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In cases of exacerbation or crisis, myasthenia gravis (MG) patients can be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), plasmapheresis, or immunoadsorption. However, IVIg efficacy data in maintenance treatment are sparse.

Methods

We prospectively observed 16 index patients with chronic and insufficiently controlled MG under standard immunosuppressant therapy and symptomatic treatment. The IVIg treatment response was measured using changes in quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and surrogates. Based on these results, a sample size calculation for a future randomized, controlled trial (RCT) was simulated.

Results

There was an enduring decline in QMG score and other parameters of about 50% under IVIg maintenance treatment. RCT sample size calculation results in 73 or 33 patients per arm to detect at least a 20% vs. 30% clinical difference in QMG score.

Conclusion

We recommend using the QMG score as a primary endpoint for an RCT of IVIg maintenance for chronic MG.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115xRVq9]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective:

To develop formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods:

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to develop consensus guidance statements. Definitions were developed for goals of treatment, minimal manifestations, remission, ocular MG, impending crisis, crisis, and refractory MG. An in-person panel meeting then determined 7 treatment topics to be addressed. Initial guidance statements were developed from literature summaries. Three rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to attain consensus on guidance statements modified on the basis of panel input.

Results:

Guidance statements were developed for symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatments, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, management of impending and manifest myasthenic crisis, thymectomy, juvenile MG, MG associated with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and MG in pregnancy.

Conclusion:

This is an international formal consensus of MG experts intended to be a guide for clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

Recommendations

The risk of MG and other immune-mediated neurologic illnesses should be discussed with patients who are candidates for ICIs (median 9, range 5–9).
At this time, there is no evidence to either support or refute the utility of AChR antibody testing in patients without MG before starting ICIs (median 8, range 7–9).
MG associated with ICIs is generally severe, with a high rate of respiratory crises (median 8, range 5–9).
Preexisting MG does not constitute an absolute contraindication to the use of ICIs, at least in patients with well-controlled disease (MM status or better). However, in these patients:

- It may be prudent to avoid combined therapy (anti–CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies), given the higher potential for severe irAEs.
- Close clinical monitoring, particularly of respiratory and bulbar function, is mandatory.
- Although the therapeutic response to ICIs seems to be less satisfactory in patients receiving immunosuppressants, MG treatment should be maintained and may even be restarted in patients whose MG is in remission before treatment with ICIs (median 8, range 5–9).
Early aggressive treatment with high-dose steroids in combination with plasma exchange or IVIg may be required in patients who develop overt MG while on ICIs. The decision to withdraw ICIs is determined by the oncologic status (median 8, range 7–9) (table e-9).

Treatment of acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) with immunotherapies successfully relieves symptoms and improves strength as documented by the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score for disease severity (QMGS). Neuromuscular function, as demonstrated by the surrogate measures of repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG), is sensitive for diagnosis and staging disease severity. This study of 51 patients treated with immunomodulation confirmed that RNS and SFEMG are useful to stage disease severity, but found that clinical measures such as the QMGS are more sensitive to change than electrophysiological parameters. The presence of blocking on SFEMG did predict responsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, providing clinicians with an objective, reliable, quantitative measure to help determine which patients will benefit from this costly treatment.

### Cost-minimization analysis comparing intravenous immunoglobulin with plasma exchange in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis [^116yk3TR]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) exacerbations may be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange (PLEX), which have equivalent effectiveness. This cost-minimization analysis compared IVIg with PLEX for treatment of patients with MG exacerbation.

Methods

We combined the Ontario-based health cost data with clinical data from a randomized clinical trial. Analyses were undertaken from the perspective of a public healthcare insurer and from the perspective of a tertiary university hospital payer.

Results

PLEX was less costly than IVIg among patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 15.7kg/m(2), from the perspective of the public healthcare insurer (P < 0.0001). However, PLEX was more costly than IVIg from the perspective of the hospital payer when the costs of blood products were excluded (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

PLEX can be considered a short-term cost-minimizing therapy when compared with IVIg for treatment of MG exacerbation among patients with BMI > 15.7kg/m(2), from the perspective of a public healthcare insurer. Muscle Nerve 53: 872–876, 2016.

### Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the corticosteroid-sparing effects of immunoglobulin in myasthenia gravis [^1139Vo8R]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction. Treatment frequently includes corticosteroids (CSs) and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). This study was conducted to determine whether immune globulin (human), 10% caprylate/chromatography purified (IGIV-C) could facilitate CS dose reduction in CS-dependent patients with MG.

Methods

In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, CS-dependent patients with MG (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Class II–Iva; AChR+) received a loading dose of 2 g/kg IGIV-C over 2 days (maximum 80 g/d) or placebo at week 0 (baseline). Maintenance doses (1 g/kg IGIV-C or placebo) were administered every 3 weeks through week 36. Tapering of CS was initiated at week 9 and continued through week 36 unless the patient worsened (quantitative MG score ≥ 4 points from baseline). CS doses were increased (based on the current CS dose) in patients who worsened. Patients were withdrawn if worsening failed to improve within 6 weeks or if a second CS increase was required. The primary efficacy end point (at week 39) was a ≥ 50% reduction in CS dose. Secondary and safety end points were assessed throughout the study and follow-up (weeks 42 and 45). The study results and full protocol are available at.

Results

The primary end point (≥ 50% reduction in CS dose) showed no significant difference between the IGIV-C treatment (60.0% of patients) and placebo (63.3%). There were no significant differences for secondary end points. Safety data indicated that IGIV-C was well tolerated.

Discussion

In this study, IGIV-C was not more effective than placebo in reducing daily CS dose. These results suggest that the effects of IGIV-C and CS are not synergistic and may be mechanistically different.

Trial Registration Information

The trial was registered on clinicaltrialsregister.eu (EudraCT #: 2013–005099–17) and(identifier NCT02473965).

Classification of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that IVIG infusions in adult patients with MG do not increase the percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in corticosteroid dose compared with placebo.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin suppresses experimental myasthenia gravis: immunological mechanisms [^117VqPmG]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2006). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration has been beneficially used in the treatment of several autoimmune disorders including myasthenia gravis (MG), although its mechanism of action is still not clear. To study the optimal conditions of IVIG treatment and delineate its mechanism of action we established a suitable model in rat experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG). We show that IVIG has a suppressive effect on the clinical symptoms of ongoing EAMG that is associated with decreased AChR-specific cellular and humoral immune reactivity. Costimulatory factors and cytokine profile analyses suggest that IVIG immunomodulation in EAMG involves suppression of B and Th1-type T cell responses with no generation of T-regulatory cells. Our data contribute to the understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying IVIG treatment in MG and in other autoimmune disorders.

### IV immunoglobulin in patients with myasthenia gravis: a randomized controlled trial [^114JKV6c]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine the effectiveness of IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and worsening weakness in a randomized, placebo-controlled, masked study.

Methods

Fifty-one patients with worsening weakness due to MG were randomized to infusion with 2 g/kg of IVIG or an equivalent volume of IV dextrose 5% in water. The Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score for Disease Severity, a validated clinical composite scale, was calculated by a masked observer at baseline and days 14 and 28.

Results

In IVIG-treated patients, a clinically meaningful improvement in QMG Score for Disease Severity was observed at day 14 and persisted at day 28. The greatest improvement occurred in patients with more severe disease as defined by a QMG Score for Disease Severity greater than 10.5.

Conclusion

This study provides level 1 evidence for the effectiveness of IV immunoglobulin in patients with worsening weakness due to myasthenia gravis.

### Comparison of IVIg and PLEX in patients with myasthenia gravis [^113aJLc7]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Both IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PLEX) are immunomodulatory treatments used to treat patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but the choice of which treatment to administer to patients is limited due to lack of evidence from adequately powered, masked, randomized, standardized trials.

Methods

We randomized 84 patients with moderate to severe MG defined as a Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score for disease severity (QMGS) of > 10.5 and worsening weakness to IVIg (Gamunex®, Talecris Biotherapeutics) 1 g/kg/day for 2 consecutive days or PLEX (Caridian Spectra) 1.0 plasma volume exchanges for 5 exchanges. The patients were evaluated at day 14 after treatment for the primary efficacy parameter of change in QMGS and secondary clinical and electrophysiologic parameters and were followed for a total of 60 days.

Results

Both IVIg and PLEX reduced the QMGS, and IVIg was comparable to PLEX in efficacy. The dropout rate was the same for both treatment arms and both treatments were well-tolerated. The presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies and greater baseline disease severity predicted a better response to therapy. The postintervention status revealed that the same proportion of patients improved with treatment: 69% on IVIg and 65% on PLEX. The duration of improvement was similar with both treatments.

Conclusions

IVIg has comparable efficacy to PLEX in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe MG. Both treatments are well-tolerated, and the duration of effect is comparable. Either treatment may be offered to patients depending on availability of resources.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that IVIg and PLEX have comparable efficacy and are equally tolerated in adult patients with moderate to severe MG within 2 weeks of treatment.

### Myasthenic crisis: guidelines for prevention and treatment [^115zmvKP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Management of myasthenic crisis (MC) requires admission of the patient into a neurological intensive care unit and timely institution of an efficient and safe treatment. Despite the growing clinical experience with disease modifying immunotherapy there is no clinical consensus regarding the use of plasma exchange or high dose immunoglobulin treatment in an ICU setting. The choice of treatment modalities seem to rely mostly on institutional preferences primarily due to a lack of well-designed clinical trials comparing currently available therapeutic options. In our experience and based on a review of recent literature we advocate the use of plasma exchange (PE) as a primary modality in the acute care setting, supported by other immunomodulatory medications such as corticosteroids. Pharmacological management cannot substitute for adequate intensive care management of the respiratory and bulbar insufficiency associated with MC. Every effort should be done to prevent myasthenic exacerbation/crisis and to develop a maintenance management that leads to effective prevention.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to plasma exchange, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to choose between IVIG and plasma exchange depending on individual patient factors (for example, plasma exchange cannot be used in patients with sepsis and IVIG cannot be used in renal failure) and on the availability of each.

### Updated consensus statement: intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^112WqmgM]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is an immune-modulating biologic therapy that is increasingly being used in neuromuscular disorders despite the paucity of high-quality evidence for various specific diseases. To address this, the AANEM created the 2009 consensus statement to provide guidance on the use of IVIG in neuromuscular disorders. Since then, there have been several randomized controlled trials for IVIG, a new FDA-approved indication for dermatomyositis and a revised classification system for myositis, prompting the AANEM to convene an ad hoc panel to update the existing guidelines. New recommendations based on an updated systemic review of the literature were categorized as Class I-IV. Based on Class I evidence, IVIG is recommended in the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in adults, multifocal motor neuropathy, dermatomyositis, stiff-person syndrome and myasthenia gravis exacerbations but not stable disease. Based on Class II evidence, IVIG is also recommended for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and pediatric GBS. In contrast, based on Class I evidence, IVIG is not recommended for inclusion body myositis, post-polio syndrome, IgM paraproteinemic neuropathy and small fiber neuropathy that is idiopathic or associated with tri-sulfated heparin disaccharide or fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 autoantibodies. Although only Class IV evidence exists for IVIG use in necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, it should be considered for anti-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase myositis given the risk of long-term disability. Insufficient evidence exists for the use of IVIG in Miller-Fisher syndrome, IgG and IgA paraproteinemic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, chronic autoimmune neuropathy, polymyositis, idiopathic brachial plexopathy and diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy.

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG)

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) consist of pooled polyclonal immunoglobulins derived from several thousand healthy donors. The precise mechanism by which IVIGs suppress autoimmune inflammation has not been definitively established but is likely to involve a plethora of molecular effects via their Fab- or Fc-fragments. Adverse effects of IVIG include headache, hypertension, allergic/anaphylactic reactions (especially in IgA-deficient patients), dermatitis, infection (HIV or viral hepatitis), pulmonary edema from fluid overload, due to the high colloid oncotic pressure of IVIGs, venous thrombosis, aseptic meningitis, and hemolysis.

IVIG should be applied at a dosage of 0.4 g/day/kg bodyweight on 5 consecutive days, alternatively 1 g/day/kg bodyweight on 2 consecutive days. IVIG have been shown to be similarly effective compared to plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption in shortening the time of mechanical ventilation during myasthenic crisis.

Moreover, IVIG may be used for clinical stabilization previous to operations (including thymectomy) or before start of an intravenous high-dosage GCS pulse therapy in case of severe MG. Clinical response rate in several open clinical studies was in the range of 80%.

For the use of IVIG in situations other than myasthenic crisis as induction therapy or as maintenance therapy — either alone or as add-on therapy to immunosuppressive drugs — no data is available from randomized controlled trials. IVIG, however, may be used for this purpose (initially 5 × 0.4 g/day/kg bodyweight and subsequently 1 × 0.4 g/day/kg bodyweight every 4–8 weeks) over a longer period of time. Single patients with therapy resistant myasthenic symptoms seem to profit from long-term therapy with IVIG. IVIG may also be used in MG patients with contraindications against other immunosuppressive agents (especially GCS).

### Association of British Neurologists (ABN) autoimmune myasthenia gravis management guidelines (2025 update) [^115Htwzu]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2025 update of the Association of British Neurologists guidelines for the management of autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) emphasises several points that are distinct from the 2015 guidelines based on recent research and publications. The main differences from the previous guidelines are: (1) The recommendation to prescribe daily steroids rather than the alternate day regimen is now standard practice. (2) There is a clear emphasis on the beneficial effects of early thymectomy. (3) Randomised controlled trial evidence now supports early use of rituximab (within 1 year of generalised disease onset), although the evidence is less robust, but still likely to be useful, in established treatment-refractory MG. (4) Finally, several clinical trials have been published for newer targeted therapies in MG, predominantly those that inhibit the complement and neonatal Fc gamma receptor pathways, the roles of which are being slowly established especially in patients unresponsive to conventional therapy.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^1149ZDzY]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG. This summary condenses the extensive background information in the full guidance statements, available on the Neurology ® Web site at.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^117Y1CKs]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to develop consensus guidance statements. Definitions were developed for goals of treatment, minimal manifestations, remission, ocular MG, impending crisis, crisis, and refractory MG. An in-person panel meeting then determined 7 treatment topics to be addressed. Initial guidance statements were developed from literature summaries. Three rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to attain consensus on guidance statements modified on the basis of panel input.

Results

Guidance statements were developed for symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatments, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, management of impending and manifest myasthenic crisis, thymectomy, juvenile MG, MG associated with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and MG in pregnancy.

Conclusion

This is an international formal consensus of MG experts intended to be a guide for clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin in neurology – mode of action and clinical efficacy [^111cjpnV]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)-a preparation of polyclonal serum IgG pooled from thousands of blood donors-has been used for nearly three decades, and is proving to be an efficient anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment for a growing number of neurological diseases. Evidence from controlled clinical trials has established IVIg as a first-line therapy for Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy. IVIg is also an effective rescue therapy in some patients with worsening myasthenia gravis, and is beneficial as a second-line therapy for dermatomyositis and stiff-person syndrome. IVIg has been tested in some neurodegenerative disorders, but a controlled study in Alzheimer disease yielded disappointing results. Despite its widespread use and therapeutic success, the mechanisms of action of IVIg are poorly understood. Several hypotheses, based on the function of either the variable or constant IgG fragments, have been proposed to explain IVIg's immunomodulatory activity. This Review highlights emerging data on the mechanisms of action of IVIg related to its anti-inflammatory activity, especially that involving the cellular Fcγ receptors and Fc glycosylation. We also summarize recent trials in neurological diseases, discuss potential biomarkers of efficacy, offer practical guidelines on administration, and provide a rationale for experimental trials in neuroinflammatory disorders.

### Clinical trials in myasthenia gravis [^111PDS4Q]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Comment: This study presents some promising results for zilucoplan and offers possibilities as a rapid onset, self-injected treatment for generalised myasthenia gravis. In addition, it seems that it can also be used with concomitant intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange when rescue therapy is needed, with no supplemental dosing required, in contrast to monoclonal antibody treatments. However, cost may be a major factor in the availability of this treatment.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^115bJKAL]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) — intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) dosing and comparative efficacy are summarized as follows: While the optimal dose of IVIG in treating acute MG exacerbation has not yet been established, no statistically significant difference was seen in efficacy with treatment using 1 versus 2 gm/kg of IVIG, and there is no difference in efficacy between IVIG and PLEX in treating clinically worsening MG. The page further states Class I evidence that IVIG does not help with tapering of corticosteroid doses in corticosteroid-dependent MG patients, and concludes there is also insufficient evidence to recommend IVIG in treating chronic, stable MG.

### Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the corticosteroid-sparing effects of immunoglobulin in myasthenia gravis [^113UcDn5]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A possible reason that IGIV-C did not produce a significant benefit above placebo might be that the placebo group itself achieved a ≥ 50% dose reduction 63% of the time. This improvement in the placebo group may make it difficult to demonstrate additional improvement from IVIG and has been seen in other MG trials. This may reflect additional immunosuppressive effects of CS from relatively recent dosage changes, as the criteria for trial inclusion required at least 3 months of CS dosing before entry but only 1 month of stable CS dosing.

Longer durations of follow-up are sometimes feasible in retrospective studies, although these lack contemporaneous controls and also may have significant variability in patient management and evaluation periods. For example, a recent uncontrolled, retrospective studyshowed a significant reduction in CS dosing (< 50%) with long-term IG dosing (subcutaneous or IV). The patients were treated for 15–78 months. This study found that CS dosing could also be reduced by other immunosuppressants.

The TEAEs seen in this study were similar to other studies of IVIG and CS in MG. IVIG remains safe in patients with MG and may have a mechanism of action separate from and not synergistic or additive with that of CS. IGIV-C did not reduce the incidence of MG exacerbations/worsening during CS taper vs placebo. MG-related SAEs in both treatment groups during CS tapering emphasize that a CS taper should be conducted slowly with careful monitoring of patients for MG exacerbations.

In conclusion, the data from this study suggested no benefit of IGIV-C treatment over placebo in the reduction of daily CS dose. However, patients on higher baseline CS doses at baseline (≥ 20 mg/d prednisone equivalent) were more likely to achieve 50% reduction in dose than patients on lower baseline doses (< 20 mg/d prednisone equivalent) in both treatment arms. The 50% reduction benchmark in the higher CS dose subgroup may have allowed for residual beneficial CS effects and was thereby easier to achieve.

### Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the corticosteroid-sparing effects of immunoglobulin in myasthenia gravis [^112gfQuw]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) results from autoimmune-mediated dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction. This dysfunction manifests through autoantibodies to postsynaptic proteins — commonly the acetylcholine receptor (85%–90%) and less frequently lipoprotein-related protein 4 and muscle-specific kinase.

For MG unresponsive to cholinesterase inhibitors, the primary treatment is immunosuppression. The drugs of first choice are frequently corticosteroids (CSs). Treatment of severe MG or exacerbations frequently includes plasma exchange or IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). Plasma exchange was shown to improve muscle strength in patients with MG. Treatment with IVIG was found to produce effects equivalent to PE with fewer adverse effects. The clinical benefit of IVIG during exacerbations of MG warranted inclusion in clinical guidelines of many neurologic societies and consideration as a core component of treatment for acute MG.

Despite CS being first-line immunosuppressive therapy, long-term CS use is associated with potentially serious side effects. Because of this downside, tapering of CS to the minimum effective dose is a goal of MG management. However, decreasing the dose without worsening the underlying MG is often challenging. Moreover, there are no standard tapering guidelines. In this study, immune globulin (human), 10% caprylate/chromatography purified (IGIV-C) was tested in CS-dependent patients with MG to determine whether IGIV-C administration could increase the percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 50% CS dose reduction compared with placebo.

### Clinical trials in myasthenia gravis [^111xi43B]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia Gravis is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with autoantibodies that are directed against post synaptic acetyl choline receptors in 80–88%. Although in many cases initial diagnosis and management is relatively straightforward, myasthenia remains a life-long condition without cure. Current treatment strategies are directed towards symptomatic relief with cholinesterase inhibitors and, in a proportion of patients, suppression of the immune response with the use of steroids and/or longer-term immunosuppressant strategies including oral immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, thymectomy, etc. many of which have significant side effects. Around 50% of patients will not respond to conventional treatment and disease course is often unpredictable with life-threatening myasthenic crises affecting 15–20% of patients at least once during their lives. In addition to the burden of disease on the individual, it has also been estimated that the financial cost from hospital admissions alone as a result of myasthenia was more than €450 million per year in Europe in 2010, and over $500 million in the USA in 2013.

As a result, more effective treatment options that might work alone or in combination with existing therapies and are better tolerated and less disruptive for patients would be welcomed. This month's journal club explores three studies, using different therapeutic targets trying to achieve these aims, all using largely similar methodology and endpoints. Unusually for our journal club the studies reported here have all been published in a single issue of Lancet Neurology, which now seems to be establishing itself as a key journal for high profile randomised clinical trials in neurological disease.

### Thymectomy for non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis [^114d2nBY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Treatments currently used for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) include steroids, non-steroid immune suppressive agents, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin and thymectomy. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the use of some of these therapeutic modalities and the evidence for non-surgical therapies are the subject of other Cochrane reviews. Significant uncertainty and variation persist in clinical practice regarding the potential role of thymectomy in the treatment of people with MG.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of thymectomy in the management of people with non-thymomatous MG.

Search Methods

On 31 March 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2013) and LILACS (January 1992 to March 2013) for RCTs. Two authors (RS and GC) read all retrieved abstracts and reviewed the full texts of potentially relevant articles. These two authors checked references of all manuscripts identified in the review to identify additional articles that were of relevance and contacted experts in the field to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary, authors were contacted for further information.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of thymectomy against no treatment or any medical treatment, and thymectomy plus medical treatment against medical treatment alone, in people with non-thymomatous MG. We did not use measured outcomes as criteria for study selection.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned that two authors would independently extract data onto a specially designed data extraction form and assess risk of bias; however, there were no included studies in the review. We would have identified any adverse effects of thymectomy from the included trials.

Main Results

We did not identify any RCTs testing the efficacy of thymectomy in the treatment of MG. In the absence of data from RCTs, we were unable to do any further analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no randomized controlled trial literature that allows meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of thymectomy on MG. Data from several class III observational studies suggest that thymectomy could be beneficial in MG. An RCT is needed to elucidate if thymectomy is useful, and to what extent, in MG.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115R2jVf]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Development of guidance treatment statements.

The following were agreed upon a priori:

1. Treatment costs and availability would not be considered, as it is not possible to make international consensus statements specific for all countries.
2. Clinical examination is assumed to have been performed by physicians skilled in the evaluation of neuromuscular disease.
3. The MGFA Clinical Classification, including remission, refers to the state of the patient at the time of evaluation.

A formal systematic review of the literature was not performed. The Task Force co-chairs and facilitator drafted initial guidance statements based on literature cited in recent national and regional MG treatment guidelines, supplemented by other literature.

Guidance statements were developed for the following:

1. Symptomatic and immunosuppressive (IS) treatments
2. IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PLEX)
3. Impending and manifest myasthenic crisis
4. Thymectomy
5. Juvenile MG (JMG)
6. MG with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-MG)
7. MG in pregnancy

### Maintenance immunosuppression in myasthenia gravis, an update [^1128N9UK]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapies for myasthenia gravis (MG) include symptomatic and immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment. Options for immunosuppression include corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, eculizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, subcutaneous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and thymectomy. The practical aspects of long-term immunosuppressive therapy in MG are critically reviewed in this article. Application of one or more of these specific therapies is guided based on known efficacy, adverse effect profile, particular disease subtype and severity, and patient co-morbidities.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for myasthenia gravis [^114nosts]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies interfere with neuromuscular transmission. As with other autoimmune diseases, people with myasthenia gravis would be expected to benefit from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and last updated in 2007.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of IVIg for treating exacerbations of myasthenia gravis or for chronic myasthenia gravis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 October 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2011) using 'myasthenia gravis' and 'intravenous immunoglobulin' as the search terms.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in which IVIg was compared with no treatment, placebo or plasma exchange, in people with myasthenia gravis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted the data and two others checked these data. For methodological reasons, no formal meta-analysis was performed.

Main Results

We identified seven RCTs. These trials differ in inclusion criteria, comparison with alternative treatment and outcomes. In a trial comparing IVIg with placebo, including 51 participants with myasthenia gravis worsening, the mean difference (MD) in quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMGS) (MD 95% CI) after 14 days was: -1.60 (95% CI - 3.23 to 0.03) this result being borderline statistically significant in favour of IVIg. In an unblinded study of 87 participants with exacerbation comparing IVIg and plasma exchange there was no difference in myasthenic muscle score (MMS) after 15 days (MD -1.00; 95% CI -7.72 to 5.72). In a study of 84 participants with worsening myasthenia gravis there was no difference in change in QMGS 14 days after IVIg or plasma exchange (MD -1.50; 95% CI -3.43 to 0.43). In a study of 12 participants with moderate or severe myasthenia gravis, which was at high risk of bias from skewed allocation, the mean fall in QMGS both for IVIg and plasma exchange after four weeks was significant (P < 0.05). A study with 15 participants with mild or moderate myasthenia gravis found no difference in change in QMGS 42 days after IVIg or placebo (MD 1.60; 95% CI -1.92 to 5.12). A study included 33 participants with moderate exacerbations of myasthenia gravis and showed no difference in change in QMGS 14 days after IVIg or methylprednisolone (MD -0.42; 95% CI -1.20 to 0.36). All these three smaller studies were underpowered. The last trial, including 168 people with exacerbations, showed no evidence of superiority of IVIg 2 g/kg over IVIg 1 g/kg on the change of MMS after 15 days (MD 3.84; 95% CI -0.98 to 8.66). Adverse events due to IVIg were moderate (fever, nausea, headache), self-limiting and subjectively less severe than with plasma exchange (although, given the available data, no statistical comparison was possible). Other than where specific limitations are mentioned the trials were generally at low risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

In exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, one RCT of IVIg versus placebo showed some evidence of the efficacy of IVIg and two did not show a significant difference between IVIg and plasma exchange. Another showed no significant difference in efficacy between 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg of IVIg. A further, but underpowered, trial showed no significant difference between IVIg and oral methylprednisolone. In chronic myasthenia gravis, there is insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine whether IVIg is efficacious.

### Effect of intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis in myasthenic crisis and worsening myasthenia gravis compared to without rescue treatment [^113B9YZE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is a paucity of studies on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)/plasmapheresis (PLEX) compared with no rescue treatment (NRT) in myasthenic crisis (MC) and worsening myasthenia gravis (WMG). We report the efficacy of RTs (IVIg and PLEX) compared with NRT in MC/WMG.

Methods

Patients with MC and those having worsening in the MG Foundation of America classification by ≥ 2 grades were included. Their clinical findings, precipitating causes, and MG Activity of Daily Living (MGADL) and MG Quality of Life (MGQoL)-15 scores were noted. Patients were either treated with IVIg (400 mg/kg/d for 5 days) or PLEX (20–25 mL/kg × 5 sessions), and nonaffording patients received only standard care. The primary outcome was improvement in MG Foundation of America classification by ≥ 2 grades, and the secondary outcomes included MG Activity of Daily Living score, MG Quality of Life-15 score, Myasthenia Muscle Score, and days of mechanical ventilation (MV), hospital stay, and reaching pre-worsening status at 1 month.

Findings

Forty-four patients were included; 19 had MC and 25 had WMG. They were treated for MG for 2 to 19 years. Forty-one (93.2%) patients achieved the primary end point; 22 (95.7%) in RT and 19 (90.5%) in NRT (P = 0.60). The overall odds ratio of RT for the primary outcome was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.70–23.50; P = 0.13). The RT group had an overall hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.37–2.40; P = 0.96) for duration of MV, had hospital stay of 0.78 days (95% CI, 0.34–1.94; P = 0.80), and achieved pre-worsening MG status in 0.99 days (95% CI, 0.40–2.40; P = 0.72) compared with NRT after adjusting for age, triggers, dose of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChEIs), and azathioprine at baseline. PLEX had an edge over IVIg in reducing the duration of MV and hospital stay, but overall hazard ratio was not significant. The RT group, however, required a lower dose of AChEIs (P = 0.04). Ten patients had mild adverse effects.

Implications

All the patients with MC and WMG improved irrespective of RT or NRT, and the RT group required a lower dose of AChEIs at 1 month. A multicenter randomized controlled trial may confirm these observations.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to IVIG, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer IVIG as short-term treatment option in patients with impending and manifest myasthenic crisis and in patients with significant respiratory or bulbar dysfunction. Initiate corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents at the same time to achieve a sustained clinical response. Consider waiting for several days for IVIG to have a beneficial effect before initiating corticosteroids because they may cause transient worsening of myasthenic weakness.

It should also be noted that there were some differences in baseline demographics. The placebo group had a higher percentage of females and younger patients than the IGIV‐C treatment group. The time since diagnosis of MG was also longer in the placebo group. These factors may have affected the study outcomes. Further studies may be warranted to fully elucidate the efficacy of IVIG as maintenance therapy in MG while carefully monitoring all patients for MG exacerbations.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^114KRFc9]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a therapeutic biologic agent that has been prescribed for over two decades to treat various neuromuscular conditions. Most of the treatments are given off-label, as little evidence from large randomized trials exists to support its use. Recently, IGIV-C has received an indication for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Because of the lack of evidence, an ad hoc committee of the AANEM was convened to draft a consensus statement on the rational use of IVIG for neuromuscular disorders. Recommendations were categorized as Class I-IV based on the strength of the medical literature. Class I evidence exists to support the prescription of IVIG to treat patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), CIDP, multifocal motor neuropathy, refractory exacerbations of myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, dermatomyositis, and stiff person syndrome. Treatment of Fisher syndrome, polymyositis, and certain presumed autoimmune neuromuscular disorders is supported only by Class IV studies, whereas there is no convincing data to substantiate the treatment of inclusion body myopathy (IBM), idiopathic neuropathies, brachial plexopathy, or diabetic amyotrophy using IVIG. Treatment with IVIG must be administered in the context of its known adverse effects. There is little evidence to advise the clinician on the proper dosing of IVIG and duration of therapy.

### Chronic low-dose intravenous immunoglobulins as steroid-sparing therapy in myasthenia gravis [^115hpkFw]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proven beneficial in myasthenic crisis, but their role as maintenance therapy is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine if maintenance therapy with low-dose IVIg improves clinical outcome and may be used as a steroid-sparing agent in myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed charts of all MG patients treated with IVIg from January 2006 to December 2019. Long-term treatment response to IVIg was assessed by improvement in the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification scale as primary end point, as well as the ability to reduce the time-weighted average required dose of prednisone as secondary end-point, in a follow-up period of 36 months.

Results

109 patients were treated with IVIg. The mean follow-up time was 34.03 ± 5.5 months. Sixty-seven patients (61.4%) responded to therapy with at least one-point improvement of the MGFA scale. There was no statistical difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between IVIg responders and non-responders. The mean prednisone dose decreased significantly from 33.1 ± 14.5 mg at baseline to 7.2 ± 7.8 mg after 36 months of IVIg treatment (P < 0.0001), with the greatest effect after 6 months (33.1 ± 14.5 mg Vs. 17.9 ± 11.7 mg; P < 0.0001). In the follow-up period of 36 months, most patients (92.5%) remained clinically and pharmacologically stable under chronic IVIg treatment.

Conclusion

This retrospective study demonstrates that chronic low-dose IVIg treatment in patients with MG improves clinical outcomes and has a prolonged and significant steroid-sparing effect over a period of 3 years.

### Efficacy and safety of maintenance intravenous immunoglobulin in generalized myasthenia gravis patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112rTf4i]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, the effect of IGIV‐C on the primary efficacy endpoint was not statistically significant. The absolute change in QMG score in the placebo group in this study (−3.1) was larger than the placebo‐induced change in similar studies investigating treatments for MG (−1.6 and −2.37), but similar to the placebo group in a study of tacrolimus in MG (−3.3). These differences in QMG score changes may be due to dissimilarities in the study populations in terms of demographics, disease severity at baseline, baseline regimen, and other factors.

It should also be pointed out that the clinical significance of the QMG score change depends on MG severity at baseline. According to Katzberg et al. a 3‐point change is clinically significant for severe MG (QMG > 16). Since baseline QMG score in our patient population was on the threshold of severe MG (14.6 in the IGIV‐C group and 16.2 in the placebo group), we cannot discount the clinical relevance of the observed 2‐point change in the IVG‐C group compared to the placebo group (−5.1 improvement vs. −3.1, respectively).

There was an apparent difference in the percentage of patients with a two‐point decrease in MG‐ADL between the IGIV‐C group and the placebo group, although there was no adjustment for multiple comparisons. MGL‐ADL is a robust and validated tool for use in MG clinical trials.

Subgroup analysis showed that the change in QMG from baseline in the subgroup with a non‐corticosteroid immunosuppressant/immunomodulator in their baseline regimen was greater in the IGIV‐C group than in the placebo group — a clinically meaningful difference. The observation warrants consideration for further research.

In summary, there were several efficacy parameters in this study that showed numerical results greater than those seen in the placebo group. Since this was a relatively small study, it is possible that it may have been underpowered to see a significant difference between arms in QMG change from baseline. However, what is more likely is that the assumed effect size for IGIV‐C may have been overestimated in the MG maintenance treatment setting.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115vXcS7]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000, and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years. The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

### Eculizumab as a rescue therapy in prolonged myasthenic crisis in the intensive care unit: a case series [^115FBwWr]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction caused by antibodies targeting postsynaptic membrane proteins. In anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody–positive (AChR+) generalized MG (gMG), terminal complement activation leads to AChR antibody–mediated destruction of the motor endplate, disrupting neuromuscular transmission. Myasthenic crises are potentially life-threatening and represent the most severe presentation of MG, characterized by profound muscle weakness, bulbar symptoms, and potential for respiratory failure. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PLEX) are conventional treatments for myasthenic exacerbations. Eculizumab (ECU) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to complement protein C5 and inhibits the activation of terminal complement, thereby protecting the neuromuscular junction from these destructive effects. The open-label extension phase of REGAIN, along with several observational studies, has supported favorable outcomes and safety with ECU in refractory gMG, but its role in severe myasthenic exacerbations or crises remains to be fully elucidated.

### New and emerging treatments for myasthenia gravis [^111jxtmf]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

New treatments on the horizon

Traditionally, patients with myasthenia gravis have been treated with pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (eg, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis during episodes of myasthenia gravis crisis or severe myasthenia gravis symptoms. These treatments are the foundation of myasthenia gravis treatment and the backbone of the 2020 international consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis and the Association of British Neurologists' guidelines on myasthenia gravis. The international consensus guidance recommends early consideration of thymectomy in patients with AChR antibody positive generalised myasthenia gravis (AChR+gMG), aged 18–50 years, although the guideline from the Association of British Neurologists emphasises early thymectomy in patients with general and ocular myasthenia gravis who are younger than 45 years. Despite these treatments, 8.5–15% of individuals with myasthenia gravis continue to have symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life or have unwanted adverse effects related to the treatments. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis has enabled the development of new targeted therapeutics with more favourable side effect profiles. Possibly future treatment algorithms might not resemble our current approach (table 1).

B cell depletion treatments

Treatments targeted at B cell depletion have received substantial attention because autoreactive B cells have important an role in the immunopathogenesis of myasthenia gravis by producing pathogenic autoantibodies. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 that depletes circulating B cells. Several retrospective and prospective studies of rituximab in AChR+gMG and MuSK antibody positive generalised myasthenia gravis (MuSK+gMG) have recently been published, focusing on new onset disease, refractory disease, or both. In a retrospective cohort study of 72 non-MuSk+gMG patients with either new onset or refractory disease treated with rituximab, 55 of 72 patients fulfilled the criteria for clinical remission. Time to remission was shorter in those with new onset generalised myasthenia gravis compared with those with refractory disease (7 v 16 months, P = 0.009). The new onset group treated with rituximab achieved clinical remission at a faster rate than the control group receiving conventional treatment (7 v 11 months, P = 0.004).

### Drug insight: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in neurology – therapeutic considerations and practical issues [^117YNsvw]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Over the past few years, we have achieved increasing success in the treatment of a number of autoimmune-mediated disorders affecting nerves and muscles. This success is partly attributable to the use of high-dose polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which has dramatically changed our treatment options. On the basis of results from controlled, but non-FDA-approved, clinical trials, IVIg is now the treatment of choice for Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy; IVIg offers rescue therapy for patients with rapidly worsening myasthenia gravis, and is a second-line therapy for dermatomyositis, stiff-person syndrome, and pregnancy-associated or postpartum multiple sclerosis attacks. The ability of IVIg to treat such immunologically diverse disorders effectively, coupled with its excellent safety profile, has led clinicians to use the drug more liberally, even in diseases for which the data are weak and not evidence-based and in patients with coexisting conditions. Use of IVIg for such indications can increase the risk of complications while raising the cost of the drug. Practical issues regarding dosing and frequency of infusions generate dilemmas in clinical practice. In this article, we review the current indications for IVIg treatment, address practical issues related to the use and costs of the drug, and summarize its mechanisms of action.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin as monotherapy for myasthenia gravis during pregnancy [^114bYwpD]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pregnant women with myasthenia gravis (MG) are at increased risk of complications and adverse outcomes, including the teratogenic effects of many drugs used to treat MG women of childbearing age. The effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) on other autoimmune mediated diseases has been extensively reported in recent years, although little is known about the role of IVIg in the treatment of MG during pregnancy. We designed this study to determine the effectiveness of IVIg as monotherapy during pregnancy for women with MG.

Material and Methods

Five pregnant MG patients (mean age at delivery 36.4years, SD 5.8, range 29.4–45.2) were studied in 2013–14. Their treatment was switched to monthly IVIg cycles 2months before the pregnancy. Follow-up included monthly neurological QMG throughout the pregnancy and postpartum, obstetrical monitoring during monthly visits in the first two trimesters of the pregnancy, fortnightly visits between week 32 and week 36, and weekly visits after 36weeks, and neonatal follow-up after delivery.

Results

We observed no exacerbations during pregnancy, delivery or post-partum. The mean QMG score at baseline (before pregnancy) was 7.4 points in five women with generalized forms of MG. The maximum mean value reached during pregnancy was 8.6 points. The mean pregnancy duration was 38 w+5 d. No infant with transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.

Conclusions

These results suggest that monotherapy with IVIg during pregnancy in MG patients could be promising, although confirmation is required in studies with larger populations.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^116u68xq]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is an updated formal international consensus guidance of MG experts, based on new evidence that has become available since the initial guidance was published in 2016. As before, these statements are intended as a guide for clinicians worldwide and are not absolute recommendations for management. They are also not intended for establishing payment policies or drug tiering by payers. This continues to be a living document, which will require periodic review and updates to reflect new information relevant to the management of MG.

### Maintenance IVIg therapy in myasthenia gravis does not affect disease activity [^1123UePy]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is insufficient data on the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) as maintenance treatment in myasthenia gravis (MG). We therefore examined response to maintenance IVIg therapy in a cohort of MG patients.

Methods

We reviewed all MG patient files treated with IVIg in our neuro-immunology clinic from 1/1995 to 9/2012. Patients treated with maintenance IVIg for a minimum of one year were separately analyzed. Disease severity was evaluated according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America clinical classification.

Results

IVIg was considered for maintenance therapy in 52 MG patients who had not responded to pyridostigmine, prednisone, azathioprine or combinations of these drugs. Fifteen patients did not improve with initial IVIg while thirty seven patients had a beneficial response and were treated with maintenance IVIg for an average of 5.9 years (range 1–17 years). Twenty two (59%) patients were female with an average age onset of disease 44.8 years. Thirty three were seropositive for acetylcholine receptor antibody and 13 had previous thymectomy. Twenty three and 14 patients achieved mild or moderate improvement respectively in disease activity while on IVIg therapy but none achieved full remission. Beneficial response was associated with older age, bulbar presentation, seropositivity and a higher antibody titer and less with ocular presentation. IVIg enabled reduction of other treatments including pyridostigmine, prednisone and azathioprine.

Conclusion

In this retrospective study on a relative small cohort of MG patients maintenance IVIg therapy was successful in reducing symptoms of MG but seems to be ineffective in inducing full remission or reducing disease activity. IVIg should be regarded only as symptomatic therapy in MG.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases [^112Rcjmc]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) enhances immune homeostasis by modulating expression and function of Fc receptors, interfering with activation of complement and production of cytokines, providing anti-idiotypic antibodies, and affecting the activation and effector functions of T and B cells. These mechanisms may explain the effectiveness of IVIG in autoimmune neuromuscular disorders.

Objective

To systematically review the current status of the treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular diseases with IVIG, with emphasis on controlled trials.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed publications identified through MEDLINE (1966–2003), EMBASE (1974–2003), and references from bibliographies of pertinent articles. Each autoimmune neuromuscular disease term was searched in combination with the term intravenous immunoglobulin.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Criteria for selection of studies included controlled study design, English language, and clinical pertinence. Data quality was based on venue of publication and relevance to clinical care.

Data Synthesis

Outcomes of controlled trials indicate that IVIG at a total dose of 2 g/kg is effective as first-line therapy in Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy and as second-line therapy in stiff-person syndrome, dermatomyositis, myasthenia gravis, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. In other controlled studies, IVIG produced a modest, variable, and transient but not statistically significant benefit in patients with inclusion body myositis and paraproteinemic anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein antibody demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulin is not effective in patients with multiple sclerosis who have established weakness or optic neuritis. In myasthenia gravis, it should be reserved for difficult cases or before thymectomy in lieu of plasma exchange.

Conclusion

Intravenous immunoglobulin is effective in many autoimmune neurologic diseases, but its spectrum of efficacy, especially as first-line therapy, and the appropriate dose for long-term maintenance therapy are not fully established. Further controlled studies of IVIG, combined with a dose-finding effect, pharmacoeconomics, and quality-of-life assessments, are warranted to improve the evidence base for clinical practice.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated myasthenia gravis [^117SXLcP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have a wide range of toxicities affecting potentially any organ system stemming from increased activity within the T-cell lineage similar to that observed in autoimmunity.

Case Report

A 57-year-old man with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treatment with combination ICI therapy presented with a history of rapidly progressive diplopia. Neurological examination revealed bilateral fatigable ptosis and asymmetrical ophthalmoplegia. His clinical findings were in keeping with an immune-mediated myasthenia gravis. He was immediately commenced on 1 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone and pyridostigmine 60 mg 3 times a day. On day 2 of admission he was given 1 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins. He made a rapid and full clinical recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Immune-mediated myasthenia gravis is an important toxicity of ICIs. Early recognition and treatment of this presentation may reduce the significant morbidity and mortality associated with it.

### Juvenile myasthenia gravis [^114iNizg]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Juvenile myasthenia gravis shares a similar pathophysiologic origin with adult myasthenia gravis, but there are important differences, mostly relating to epidemiology, presentation, and therapeutic decision making. Gender ratios and the proportion of seropositive patients differ in the pre- and postpubertal age groups. The diagnostic evaluation is similar to that in adults, although special techniques are sometimes necessary to perform single-fiber electromyography in younger patients. Therapeutic decisions in affected children and adolescents are complicated by the greater long-term consequences of using steroids, and thus other interventions, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis, may play a greater therapeutic role in this population than in adults. Steroid-sparing agents may contribute to the management of refractory cases, but they should be used with caution due to the risk of malignancy.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115nGpi1]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to offer plasma exchange or IVIG when a prompt, although temporary, response is required during pregnancy. Take into account both maternal and fetal issues, weighing the risks of these treatments against the requirement for use during pregnancy and their potential benefits.
