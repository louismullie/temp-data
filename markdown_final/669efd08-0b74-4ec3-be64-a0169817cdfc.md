## Question

How is polycystic ovarian disease defined?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how polycystic ovarian disease (polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS) is defined, including the diagnostic criteria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame PCOS as a condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features across the lifespan. Then, I should verify the foundational diagnostic principle of excluding mimicking disorders. Next, I will apply the adult diagnostic framework grounded in the Rotterdam criteria and the 2018/2023 International Guideline updates, carefully defining hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology including the AMH substitution. After that, I must consider phenotypic classification and metabolic risk gradients. Finally, I will adjust for adolescent-specific criteria and synthesize a concise operational definition with attention to evidence quality and shared decision-making [^1117JkvU] [^114NTN9g] [^116qoTAs] [^112EPdra].

> Let me first confirm the condition's identity and scope. PCOS is a heterogeneous, multisystem syndrome with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological manifestations; I initially recall prevalence being cited as high as 15–20%, but wait, I should verify the most consistent range, which contemporary summaries place at approximately 8–13% of reproductive-aged women, with variability linked to diagnostic criteria and populations, and with a global burden that has been increasing over recent decades [^112EPdra] [^114NbQzh] [^114MnVoc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding mimics. I need to ensure the diagnostic workup first rules out conditions that can resemble PCOS, including thyroid dysfunction with TSH testing, hyperprolactinemia with serum prolactin, and nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with a 17-hydroxyprogesterone, with additional evaluation for Cushing's syndrome or androgen-secreting tumors when clinical features suggest rapid onset or virilization, as emphasized by the Endocrine Society and ACOG [^113Yei1w] [^116qoTAs] [^116K2XFw].

> Next, I should review the adult diagnostic framework. After exclusion of mimics, the Rotterdam criteria endorsed by the 2018 and affirmed in the 2023 International Guideline define PCOS when any two of three features are present: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology, with the 2023 update allowing serum AMH to substitute for ultrasound in adults and clarifying that if irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism are clearly present, imaging or AMH are not required for diagnosis [^1117JkvU] [^114NTN9g] [^116qoTAs] [^114NbQzh].

> Let me consider hyperandrogenism carefully. Clinical hyperandrogenism includes hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, and moderate to severe acne, though I should confirm that hirsutism thresholds can vary by ethnicity and scoring system, and for biochemical hyperandrogenism I should double-check that calculated free testosterone, the free androgen index, or bioavailable testosterone measured with high-quality assays are recommended to improve diagnostic specificity in both adults and adolescents [^116rqeHr] [^1117JkvU].

> I need to check ovulatory dysfunction definitions. In adults, irregular menstrual cycles such as intervals shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days, fewer than about eight cycles per year, or biochemical confirmation of anovulation with a low mid-luteal serum progesterone provide evidence of ovulatory disturbance; wait, I should verify that a mid-luteal progesterone threshold is acceptable for confirming anovulation when cycle history is equivocal, which the Endocrine Society supports in fertility evaluations [^112pHyL7] [^1117JkvU].

> Now, I will examine polycystic ovarian morphology and the AMH substitution. PCOM on transvaginal ultrasound in adults is typically defined as at least 20 antral follicles measuring 2–9 mm in at least one ovary and or ovarian volume exceeding 10 mL, and the 2023 guideline permits using AMH as an alternative marker of follicle excess in adult diagnosis; wait, I should verify real-world utility, and evidence from a tertiary cohort suggests ultrasound was necessary in about 30% of cases, primarily to classify phenotypes when only one other criterion was present, supporting selective imaging rather than routine use [^114GocBs] [^1117JkvU].

> Let me think about phenotypes and metabolic risk. Applying the Rotterdam framework yields four phenotypes: A with hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and PCOM; B with hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction; C with hyperandrogenism and PCOM but intact ovulation; and D with ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM without hyperandrogenism; I should confirm the risk gradient, where classic NIH phenotypes A and B show the highest rates of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, C is intermediate, and D tends to have the lowest metabolic burden, with hyperandrogenemia repeatedly implicated as a key driver of metabolic and reproductive morbidity [^1112z27x] [^117268a1] [^114EoauE] [^11553Lhi].

> But wait, what if the patient is an adolescent. I should double-check adolescent-specific rules because pubertal physiology overlaps with adult criteria; the international recommendations require both unequivocal hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction for diagnosis in adolescents, explicitly advising against pelvic ultrasound and against AMH within eight years post-menarche due to poor specificity, with cycle irregularity thresholds defined by time since menarche to avoid overdiagnosis during normal maturation [^112N5i71] [^116rqeHr] [^1117JkvU] [^114NbQzh].

> Next, I should review how guidelines have evolved and the strength of evidence. The 2018 and 2023 International Evidence-Based Guidelines applied AGREE II and GRADE processes, promoted shared decision-making, clarified diagnostic pathways including AMH substitution, and acknowledged that despite improvements, much of the diagnostic evidence remains low to moderate in quality, so I need to ensure individualized care and transparent communication about uncertainty with patients [^1117JkvU] [^114NTN9g] [^112wF9NW] [^115PeCn8].

> Finally, I will synthesize the operational definition. After excluding mimicking disorders, an adult is diagnosed with PCOS when any two of the following are present: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction by history or biochemical confirmation, and either polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound or elevated AMH as an acceptable substitute, recognizing that when irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism co-exist, imaging or AMH are unnecessary; for adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required and ovarian imaging or AMH should be avoided within eight years post-menarche, with phenotypic classification useful for risk stratification and counseling about metabolic health, while I remain mindful of assay quality, ethnic variation, and the overall evidence grade when advising patients [^1117JkvU] [^116qoTAs] [^1162d14v] [^114GocBs] [^112N5i71].

Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), also known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a common endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women [^112EPdra], defined by **hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology** [^114NbQzh] [^116qoTAs]. Diagnosis requires two of these three features after excluding other causes [^114NbQzh], and in adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ovarian morphology not used [^114NTN9g] [^112N5i71] [^1117JkvU]. PCOS is associated with **insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and infertility** [^114EoauE] [^114piiZ6] [^115jZysg] [^115K1vgq] [^114NbQzh]. Management is individualized and includes lifestyle changes, hormonal therapy, and insulin sensitizers such as metformin [^111xL7oK] [^114NbQzh] [^111hBihg].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of PCOS is based on the **Rotterdam criteria**, which require at least two of the following three features [^116qoTAs] [^114NbQzh]. Other conditions that mimic PCOS — such as thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia — **must be excluded** [^113Yei1w] before confirming the diagnosis [^116K2XFw]:

- **Hyperandrogenism**: Clinical (hirsutism, acne, alopecia) or biochemical evidence of elevated androgens [^116qoTAs].

- **Ovulatory dysfunction**: Oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstrual periods) or amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) [^112pHyL7].

- **Polycystic ovarian morphology**: Ultrasound evidence of enlarged ovaries with multiple small follicles [^114GocBs].

---

## Clinical features

PCOS presents with a **broad spectrum of clinical manifestations**, including:

- **Menstrual irregularities**: Irregular or absent menstrual periods due to chronic anovulation [^112LT5Dv].

- **Hyperandrogenism**: Excess androgen levels causing hirsutism, acne, and male-pattern hair loss [^113mUPS4].

- **Infertility**: Difficulty conceiving due to ovulatory dysfunction [^113zZMAM].

- **Metabolic abnormalities**: Insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114EoauE].

- **Psychological symptoms**: Anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^111i6m1Y].

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact cause of PCOS is unknown and reflects a complex interplay among genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors [^112E52ZM]. The pathophysiology involves **excess androgen production** by the ovaries and adrenal glands, which contributes to reproductive and metabolic abnormalities [^11553Lhi] [^112MWBXb]; insulin resistance, which leads to hyperinsulinemia and exacerbates hyperandrogenism [^114EoauE]; and genetic susceptibility, supported by familial clustering [^111i6m1Y].

---

## Management

Management of PCOS is individualized according to symptoms, age, and reproductive goals [^114NbQzh]. Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, dietary changes, and regular exercise, improve **insulin sensitivity** and reduce **metabolic risks** [^111xL7oK] [^111eTeoJ]. Pharmacologic therapy includes hormonal contraceptives to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels [^113zZMAM], and insulin sensitizers, such as metformin, to improve metabolic outcomes [^111hBihg]. For women seeking pregnancy, ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate or letrozole is used [^115mqjET].

---

## Long-term complications

PCOS is associated with several **long-term health risks**, including:

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**: Increased risk due to insulin resistance [^115jZysg].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Elevated risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular events [^115K1vgq].

- **Endometrial cancer**: Increased risk due to chronic anovulation and unopposed estrogen exposure [^117Kbn2A].

- **Psychological disorders**: Higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^111i6m1Y].

---

Polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) is a **common endocrine disorder** characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology [^112EPdra] [^114NTN9g]. It is associated with significant metabolic, reproductive, and psychological complications, and management involves individualized treatment strategies to address these diverse clinical features [^114MnVoc] [^1117JkvU].

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NTN9g]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high-quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences, and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (approximately 6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus-based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ii) ovulatory dysfunction, and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. As of 2023, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. It's important to exclude other etiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, the diagnosis is simplified, and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required for diagnosis.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, involving genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed for diagnosis, as ovarian morphology lacks specificity. The diagnostic criteria generate four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and evolving across adolescence and adulthood.

Treatment involves lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimization includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications, and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, the combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and, if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism.

In this review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, medical management, and infertility.

In the medical management of polycystic ovary syndrome, particularly concerning insulin sensitizers, the Endocrine Society 2013 guidelines recommend initiating metformin in patients with PCOS and type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance who have failed lifestyle modification. Consider initiating metformin if the goal is to treat impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^116rqeHr]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This recommendation was informed by previous available guidelines, multidisciplinary expertise, consumer perspectives, international feedback, and the potential for both over and delayed diagnosis when assessing this diagnostic feature in PCOS. The recommendation considered available data on normal physiological events during adolescence, such as menstrual cycle interval variations according to time post-menarche and the common occurrence of anovulation in early post-menarcheal years. Physiological maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary ovarian axis occurs over the years, and ovulation and menstrual cycles in adolescents may not match those of women in reproductive age. More specific cut-offs aligned with gynecological maturity were provided compared to previous guidelines.

- **Ovarian dysfunction**: Another practice point from the guideline is that ovarian dysfunction can occur in adolescents or women with regular menstrual cycles. If anovulation is suspected, measuring serum progesterone levels can confirm it.

- **Hyperandrogenism biochemical**: Calculated free testosterone, free androgen index, or bioavailable testosterone should be used to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in the diagnosis of PCOS. This was the only strong evidence-based recommendation, albeit of low GRADE quality, for biochemical testing for hyperandrogenism, including one study in adolescents. This recommendation was determined after examining literature showing that androgen levels in adolescents reach adult levels around the time of menarche. Seven studies evaluated the most effective approaches.

**What does this mean for adolescents and women with PCOS**: This guideline aims to optimize evidence-based, consistent care that meets the needs and improves the quality of life of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages, targeting areas and outcomes of priority for women with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their health care providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment, and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on partnership in care and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture, and values are considered. With effective translation, the guideline and health professional and consumer resources will address gaps and priorities identified by women with PCOS and will promote vital future research.

### Environmental determinants of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112E52ZM]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

In this review, we summarize existing research on a variety of environmental factors potentially involved in the etiology, prevalence, and modulation of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and we suggest avenues for future research. The main environmental factors we consider include environmental toxins, diet and nutrition, socioeconomic status, and geography.

There is some evidence that environmental toxins play a role in disrupting reproductive health, but there is limited research as to how these toxins may affect the development of PCOS. Although research has also shown that PCOS symptoms are reduced with certain dietary supplements and with weight loss among obese women, additional research is needed to compare various approaches to weight loss, as well as nutritional factors that may play a role in preventing or mitigating the development of PCOS.

Limited studies indicate some association of low socioeconomic status with certain PCOS phenotypes, and future research should consider socioeconomic conditions during childhood or adolescence that may be more relevant to the developmental onset of PCOS. Finally, the limited scope of comparable international studies on PCOS needs to be addressed, because global patterns of PCOS are potentially valuable indicators of cultural, environmental, and genetic factors that may contribute to excess risk in certain regions of the world.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom-based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

### The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: The criteria are insufficiently robust for clinical research [^116PgXbM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder with considerable phenotypic variability, leading to controversy over its exact definition and diagnosis. The objective of this study was to review the recently proposed diagnostic criteria to determine their robustness for clinical and research practice. We reviewed the literature on clinical measurement and quality of laboratory analysis related to clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism.

The recently published statements regarding the diagnosis of PCOS assume that clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies are dichotomous variables, without considering the impact of observer subjectivity or measurement variability on the outcome. The data suggest considerable uncertainty in measurements and a lack of clarity in the definition of 'hyperandrogenaemia', which can lead to misdiagnosis. The diagnostic strategies for PCOS are defined too vaguely to ensure that individuals meet the definition of the syndrome.

A pragmatic approach may be taken in managing an individual based on her specific symptoms and needs. However, research into the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of PCOS will require the development of robust definitions for the diagnostic criteria. We propose specific criteria that address the criticisms raised.

### Divergences in insulin resistance between the different phenotypes of the polycystic ovary syndrome [^117268a1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have generated distinct PCOS phenotypes based on the different combinations of diagnostic features found in each patient. Our aim was to assess whether either each single diagnostic feature or their combinations into the PCOS phenotypes may predict insulin resistance in these women.

A total of 137 consecutive Caucasian women with PCOS, diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria, underwent accurate assessment of diagnostic and metabolic features. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the glucose clamp technique.

Among women with PCOS, 84.7% had hyperandrogenism, 84.7% had chronic oligoanovulation, and 89% had polycystic ovaries. According to the individual combinations of these features, 69.4% of women had the classic phenotype, 15.3% had the ovulatory phenotype, and 15.3% had the normoandrogenic phenotype. Most subjects (71.4%) were insulin resistant. However, insulin resistance frequency differed among phenotypes, being 80.4%, 65.0%, and 38.1%, respectively, in the three subgroups (P < .001). Although none of the PCOS diagnostic features per se was associated with impairment in insulin action, after adjustment for covariates, the classic phenotype and, to a lesser extent, the ovulatory phenotype were independently associated with insulin resistance, whereas the normoandrogenic phenotype was not. Metabolic syndrome frequency was also different among phenotypes (P = 0.030).

There is a scale of metabolic risk among women with PCOS.

### Hyperandrogenemia is implicated in both the metabolic and reproductive morbidities of polycystic ovary syndrome [^11553Lhi]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that are implicated in the associated reproductive and metabolic morbidities. This research employed a cross-sectional case-control design conducted in an academic medical setting.

The participants included a total of 1,062 women with PCOS and 1,887 women without PCOS. There were no interventions administered during the study.

The main outcome measures were as follows: physical examination, including hirsutism scoring, biochemical and hormone measurements, ovarian ultrasound, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test to measure glucose and insulin levels.

- **Results**: A factor analysis identified four dominant factors in women with PCOS. These factors were interpreted as: [1] metabolic and hyperandrogenemia factor, [2] oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia factor, [3] blood pressure factor, and [4] ovarian morphology factor. In women with PCOS, hyperandrogenemia was a significant predictor of metabolic syndrome after adjusting for age, body mass index, and insulin resistance in the regression analysis.

- **Conclusion**: The factor analysis identified multiple factors responsible for the abnormalities associated with PCOS. Hyperandrogenemia was a common underlying feature of the metabolic and reproductive abnormalities in women with PCOS, but not in women without PCOS.

### Large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis of polycystic ovary syndrome suggests shared genetic architecture for different diagnosis criteria [^111i6m1Y]. PLoS Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women, with a complex pattern of inheritance. Two different diagnostic criteria based on expert opinion have been utilized: the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria require hyperandrogenism (HA) and ovulatory dysfunction (OD), while the Rotterdam criteria include the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) and require at least two of three traits to be present, resulting in four phenotypes. PCOS by NIH criteria has a prevalence of approximately 7% in reproductive-age women worldwide; the use of the broader Rotterdam criteria increases this to 15–20% across different populations.

PCOS is commonly associated with insulin resistance, pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These metabolic abnormalities are most pronounced in women with the NIH phenotype. In addition, the odds for moderate or severe depression and anxiety disorders are higher in women with PCOS. However, the mechanisms behind the association between the reproductive, metabolic, and psychiatric features of the syndrome remain largely unknown.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in women of Han Chinese and European ancestry have reproducibly identified 16 loci. The observed susceptibility loci in PCOS appear to be shared between NIH criteria and self-reported diagnosis, which is particularly intriguing. Genetic analyses of causality by Mendelian Randomization analysis among women of European ancestry with self-reported PCOS suggested that body mass index (BMI)…

### The association between obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome: An epidemiologic study of observational data [^114piiZ6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female cardiometabolic-reproductive disorder. It is unclear whether the global obesity epidemic is impacting the high PCOS prevalence.

- **Objective**: To determine the association between the prevalence of PCOS and obesity.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review was conducted to identify population studies on PCOS prevalence globally through July 2023. Linear regression and random-effect models were applied to examine the association of mean body mass index (BMI) or obesity prevalence with the prevalence of PCOS diagnosed by 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH), 2003 Rotterdam (Rotterdam), and 2006 Androgen Excess-PCOS (AE-PCOS) criteria. Subgroup analyses were also conducted for recruitment methods and study quality.

- **Results**: Fifty-eight studies with 85,956 adults from 24 countries were included. Considering all available data, a borderline association was observed between PCOS and obesity prevalence when using the AE-PCOS but not the NIH or Rotterdam criteria. Alternatively, subgroup analysis of studies with better recruitment methods demonstrated a significant positive association of population mean BMI or obesity prevalence with PCOS prevalence when using the Rotterdam or AE-PCOS criteria, while using only high-quality studies revealed an association using NIH as well as Rotterdam and AE-PCOS criteria. Overall, we observed that a 1% increase in obesity prevalence resulted in an approximately 0.4% increase in PCOS prevalence by the Rotterdam criteria.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalences of PCOS and obesity appear to be interrelated, with obesity potentially contributing to higher PCOS prevalence rates.

### How frequently is ultrasound required to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome in a clinical population [^114GocBs]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition, affecting up to 20% of reproductive-aged women worldwide. Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) may be present but is not required for diagnosis. Our study seeks to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in diagnosing or excluding PCOS according to the 2023 International Guidelines Criteria.

- **Materials and methods**: Subjects were patients seen in a tertiary care referral clinic in whom other causes of hyperandrogenism (HA) were ruled out. All underwent a complete history, physical examination, modified Ferriman-Gallwey scoring, and serum androgen testing; followed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) to assess ovarian morphology if indicated. PCOM was identified as an antral follicle count ≥ 20 and/or ovarian volume > 10 mL in at least one ovary. After clinical classification, PCOS was diagnosed by at least two of three criteria: biochemical/clinical HA, ovulatory dysfunction (OD), and PCOM. Statistics were calculated using Fisher's exact test and chi-square.

- **Results**: In total, 454 subjects were included. Of these, 299 were classified as group A/B and did not require TVUS for diagnosis. Of 82 subjects with HA alone, 50 (61.0%) were classified as group C after demonstrating PCOM. Fifty-five subjects had OD alone, 37 (67.3%) of whom were classified as group D based on PCOM. In total, 137 out of 454 subjects, or 30.2%, required TVUS for the diagnosis or exclusion of PCOS. TVUS was necessary in less than one-third of subjects, primarily identifying PCOS groups C or D. The selective use of ovarian ultrasonography may reduce the costs and complexity of epidemiological studies.

### Reproductive endocrinology: New guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS [^114AqiAG]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

An Endocrine Society-appointed task force has developed an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. The guidelines provide suggestions for the management of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and highlight many areas of uncertainty requiring further scientific efforts.

### Criteria, prevalence, and phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116isXwp]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder affecting reproductive-aged women worldwide. This article addresses the evolution of the criteria used to diagnose PCOS, reviews recent advances in the phenotypic approach — specifically in the context of the extended Rotterdam criteria — discusses limitations of the criteria used for diagnosis, particularly when studying adolescents and women in the peri- and postmenopausal stages, and describes significant strides made in understanding the epidemiology of PCOS.

Although there is a high prevalence of PCOS, variability increases when using the Rotterdam 2003 criteria due to limitations in population sampling and approaches to defining PCOS phenotypes. The review further discusses the distribution of PCOS phenotypes, their associated morbidity, and the role that referral bias plays in the epidemiology of this syndrome.

### Clustering identifies subtypes with different phenotypic characteristics in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1112z27x]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex genetic disorder reflecting the interaction of susceptibility genes and environmental factors. It is among the most common endocrine disorders of reproductive-aged girls and women, affecting 5% to 15% of this population worldwide, depending on the diagnostic criteria applied. PCOS is characterized by the presence of two or more of the following features: ovulatory dysfunction (OD), hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM). All of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS are based on expert opinion.

The first diagnostic criteria, known as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, required the presence of both OD and HA, without including PCOM. In 2003, PCOM was added as a diagnostic criterion, and the diagnosis of PCOS required two out of three of the following features: OD, HA, or PCOM. The application of these so-called Rotterdam criteria resulted in four phenotypes, designated as follows:

- **Phenotype A**: HA + OD + PCOM
- **Phenotype B**: HA + OD
- **Phenotype C**: HA + PCOM
- **Phenotype D**: OD + PCOM

The phenotypes including HA + OD, with or without PCOM and which do not differ biochemically, are often designated as the NIH phenotype or classic PCOS. The combination of HA + PCOM and OD + PCOM are known as the non-NIH Rotterdam phenotypes. The Androgen Excess Society criteria include only the phenotypes with HA. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had adequate power to formally compare NIH PCOS, non-NIH Rotterdam PCOS, and self-reported PCOS. In this study, no significant differences were observed.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive-age women. Hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance are important factors in its pathogenesis, leading to higher risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its complications. With the implementation of the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria in 2003, the PCOS patient group became highly heterogeneous, with varying metabolic risk reported for different phenotypes of the syndrome. This review aims to assess the prevalence and severity of MetS and its components in patients with the four phenotypes of PCOS. A comprehensive search of the PubMed database was performed to identify studies comparing metabolic characteristics between PCOS patients with different phenotypes of the syndrome. Results from 60 studies published between 2004 and 2020 were retrieved and analyzed.

More adverse metabolic profiles were observed in PCOS patients with hyperandrogenic phenotypes compared to normoandrogenic patients, as well as in classic phenotypes, defined by National Institutes of Health criteria, compared to newer phenotypes introduced by the Rotterdam criteria. In the majority of observations, normoandrogenic PCOS patients did not differ significantly from controls in terms of metabolic characteristics. However, some East Asian studies reported more adverse metabolic profiles in the normoandrogenic phenotype compared to healthy women.

In conclusion, metabolic abnormalities in PCOS seem to be associated with the joint effects of hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and visceral obesity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113Yei1w]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the 2013 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend excluding the following disorders, which can mimic the clinical features of PCOS, before confirming a diagnosis:

- **Thyroid disease**: Ensure thyroid function is normal to rule out thyroid abnormalities.
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Check prolactin levels, as elevated levels can lead to similar symptoms.
- **Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: Primarily screen for 21-hydroxylase deficiency by measuring serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112pHyL7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for polycystic ovary syndrome, and more specifically concerning history and physical examination, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend screening for ovulatory status using menstrual history in all patients with PCOS seeking fertility. It is important to recognize that some patients with PCOS who have a eumenorrheic menstrual history may still experience anovulation; thus, obtaining a mid-luteal serum progesterone level as an additional screening test is advised.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1117JkvU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes, including 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on the best available, but generally very low to low-quality, evidence. The guideline applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. It transitioned from consensus-based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced the accuracy of diagnosis while promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not adequately met, the evidence quality was low, and evidence-practice gaps persist.

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations, with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. An extensive evidence synthesis was completed. AGREE II-compliant processes were followed.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114MnVoc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, heterogeneous, multisystem disorder affecting 8%–13% of reproductive-aged women and 3%–11% of adolescent girls, depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied. PCOS is characterized by oligo/amenorrhea, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adult women.

PCOS has significant metabolic, reproductive, and psychological sequelae, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular risk factors, anovulation, subfertility, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of PCOS using the 2003 Rotterdam criteria is based on the presence of two out of three features: oligo/amenorrhea, clinical/biochemical HA, and PCOM on ultrasound following the exclusion of secondary causes. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence-based guideline (EBG) for adult women.

This guideline, which includes recommendations for PCOS diagnosis and management, is underpinned by an extensive process of evidence synthesis involving 37 professional societies and consumer groups around the world, 71 experts in all aspects of PCOS, including consumers, and an extensive literature review with 40 systematic reviews and 20 narrative reviews detailed in the 1800-page guideline evidence document.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^1162d14v]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% to 13% of women globally. It is a condition characterized by metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features, with health impacts across the lifespan. The etiology of PCOS is complex, involving an interplay of several factors, including genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life, and adiposity-related dysfunction leading to hypothalamic-ovarian disturbance. Diagnosis is recommended based on the International PCOS Guideline criteria, with confirmation in adults when two out of the following three criteria are met: (i) hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical); (ii) irregular cycles; and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. Due to its clinical heterogeneity, distinct phenotypes, variation across the lifespan, and ethnic variation, PCOS diagnosis can present significant diagnostic challenges to clinicians.

### Updated adolescent diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: Impact on prevalence and longitudinal body mass index trajectories from birth to adulthood [^114Lj8ey]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, with an estimated prevalence of 8–13%. Its pathogenesis includes insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, which drive reproductive (menstrual dysfunction, infertility), metabolic (metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors), and psychological (anxiety, depression, low quality of life) complications. Given the high prevalence and diverse features across the lifespan, along with the high prevalence of obesity that further exacerbates its clinical features, PCOS contributes significantly to the global burden of disease. It is therefore imperative to recognize the condition early to facilitate interventions and prevent complications.

Being a heterogeneous disorder, the diagnosis of PCOS is difficult and often delayed. PCOS diagnosis is based on oligo-anovulation (OA), biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound. This extends across the original 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria (OA and HA), the 2003 Rotterdam criteria (any two of OA, HA, and PCOM), and the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (AE-PCOS) Society criteria (HA and OA, or PCOM, or both). The Rotterdam criteria are now widely accepted and generate four possible diagnostic PCOS phenotypes in adult women:

- **Phenotype A**: OA + HA + PCOM
- **Phenotype B**: OA + HA
- **Phenotype C**: HA + PCOM
- **Phenotype D**: OA + PCOM

The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence-based guideline, which was co-developed based on unprecedented evidence.

### Contemporary approaches to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111eTeoJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women during their reproductive years. It is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Additionally, PCOS is associated with various metabolic abnormalities, particularly insulin resistance and obesity, which play a critical role in its pathophysiology. These metabolic issues negatively influence ovarian function and fertility. This review article summarizes the available treatments for women with PCOS and discusses potentially new therapies.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): The Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^117Kbn2A]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in females, with a high prevalence. The etiology of this heterogeneous condition remains obscure, and its phenotype expression varies. Two widely cited previous ESHRE/ASRM sponsored PCOS consensus workshops focused on diagnosis (published in 2004) and infertility management (published in 2008), respectively. The present third PCOS consensus report summarizes knowledge and identifies knowledge gaps regarding various women's health aspects of PCOS.

Relevant topics addressed — all dealt with in a systematic fashion — include adolescence, hirsutism and acne, contraception, menstrual cycle abnormalities, quality of life, ethnicity, pregnancy complications, long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health, and finally cancer risk. Additional, comprehensive background information is provided separately in an extended online publication.

### Implicating androgen excess in propagating metabolic disease in polycystic ovary syndrome [^112MWBXb]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has traditionally been perceived as a reproductive disorder due to its most common presentation with menstrual dysfunction and infertility. However, it is now clear that women with PCOS are at increased risk of metabolic dysfunction, including impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. PCOS is characterized by androgen excess, with cross-sectional data showing that hyperandrogenism is directly complicit in the development of metabolic complications. Recent studies have shown that C11-oxy C19 androgens are emerging as clinically and biochemically significant in PCOS, emphasizing the importance of understanding the impact of both classic and C11-oxy C19 androgens on women's health. Here, we discuss androgen metabolism in the context of PCOS and dissect the role played by androgens in the development of metabolic disease through their effects on metabolic target tissues in women.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and quality assessment study [^1116kF4t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Our electronic search identified 575 titles and abstracts, of which we screened 26 articles in full against our inclusion criteria. We included a total of 5 national and 8 international PCOS CPGs (n = 13).

- **Selection and inclusion process**: The majority of included CPGs were published within the last 10 years (range 2007–2018), and all but one were reported as peer-reviewed. Most CPGs employed simple panel discussions to reach consensus among coauthors, and only 2 (2/13, 15%) used an established consensus methodology, such as the Delphi method. Seven CPGs utilized a clear evidence grading system when making recommendations (7/13, 54%), and only 2 (2/13, 15%) provided clear implementation tools for evidence into clinical practice.

The median number of recommendations made per guideline was 26 (range 6–90). Screening for and managing metabolic disease was the most commonly covered disease domain in 12 CPGs (12/13, 92%), followed by recommendations on cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). In contrast, the management of mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least commonly addressed disease domains across the included CPGs.

### Pcos forum: research in polycystic ovary syndrome today and tomorrow [^111uDWeT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

This research paper aims to summarize promising areas of investigation into polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to stimulate further research in this area. The study design is based on a summary of a conference held by international researchers specializing in PCOS.

- **Results**: Potential areas for further research include analyzing predisposing conditions that increase the risk of PCOS, focusing on genetic background and environmental factors such as endocrine disruptors and lifestyle. The hypothesis that androgen excess may contribute to insulin resistance should be re-examined from a developmental perspective, as animal studies suggest that early exposure to modest androgen excess is associated with insulin resistance. It is crucial to define alterations in steroidogenesis in PCOS by quantifying ovarian, adrenal, and extraglandular contributions, while establishing universal standards for blood reference levels. Further elucidation is needed on intraovarian regulation of follicle development and mechanisms of follicle arrest. PCOS status is expected to have long-term consequences, notably in the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hormone-dependent cancers. Identifying susceptible individuals through genomic and proteomic approaches could aid in individualizing therapy and prevention.

- **Conclusions**: Several intriguing areas for future research in PCOS are identified. A potential limitation of the review is its selective focus on the most controversial areas.

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113GGf7U]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

More than 1 out of 10 women worldwide are diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the leading cause of female reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Despite its high prevalence, PCOS and its accompanying morbidities are likely underdiagnosed, with women averaging more than 2 years and consulting 3 physicians before receiving a diagnosis. Although it has been intensively researched, the underlying causes of PCOS have yet to be defined. To understand PCOS pathophysiology, its developmental origins, and how to predict and prevent PCOS onset, there is an urgent need for safe and effective markers and treatments.

In this review, we detail which animal models are more suitable for contributing to our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of PCOS. We summarize and highlight the advantages and limitations of hormonal or genetic manipulation of animal models, as well as those of naturally occurring PCOS-like females.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome as a metabolic disease [^117CpVuL]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous familial disorder affecting up to one in five women. The aetiology remains unclear, but available evidence suggests it is a polygenic disorder with epigenetic, developmental, and environmental components. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS are based on reproductive features, and the syndrome is categorized into several phenotypes that can vary by race and ethnicity. Insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and contribute to many adverse metabolic outcomes that place a substantial burden on the health of women with PCOS across their lifespan. Metabolic abnormalities similar to those identified in women with PCOS are also present in their female and male first-degree relatives.

Overall, more emphasis is required on defining PCOS as a metabolic disorder in addition to a reproductive one. This approach could affect the management and future treatment options for the syndrome. The rationale of the review is to identify and analyze existing evidence for PCOS as both a metabolic and reproductive disease.

### Risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: Population based cohort study [^114DYLiQ]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting about 5–15% of women of reproductive age. The condition is characterized by oligo-ovulation or anovulation, biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. According to the Rotterdam consensus from 2003, the presence of two of these three criteria fulfills a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. The cause of polycystic ovary syndrome is not fully understood; however, evidence of a genetic component has been recognized in family and twin studies. Oligo-ovulation or anovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome is a major cause of infertility, and such women might require ovulation induction or assisted reproductive technology to become pregnant. Changes to lifestyle can, however, improve the metabolic and endocrine consequences of having polycystic ovary syndrome, thus possibly improving infertility caused by anovulation.

Evidence suggests that polycystic ovary syndrome has a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes, with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disease during pregnancy, and preterm birth. Available studies are, however, limited in size and have mainly included women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Consequently, the extent to which the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome is attributed to the underlying disorder or infertility treatment is uncertain. We carried out a large nationwide cohort study of pregnant women, including pregnancies conceived spontaneously and by assisted reproduction.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112wF9NW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The study question addresses the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference.

The summary answer indicates that international evidence-based guidelines, comprising 166 recommendations and practice points, were developed. These address prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and to improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What is known already is that previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial, and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met, and evidence practice gaps persist.

- **Study design, size, and duration**: The development of international evidence-based guidelines engaged professional societies and consumer organizations, with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength.

- **Participants/materials, setting, methods**: Governance included a six-continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive…

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116dFBqP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy, affecting 8%–13% of reproductive-aged women. The etiology of the syndrome is complex, involving genetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life, and adiposity-related dysfunction leading to perturbations in hypothalamic–ovarian function. The clinical features of PCOS are heterogeneous, with manifestations arising even in early adolescence and developing into multisystem reproductive, metabolic, and psychological manifestations in adulthood. In this review, we discuss challenges in the diagnosis of PCOS and understanding of the natural history of the condition.

### Is ultrasound useful in the diagnosis of adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome [^111y4vBG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains challenging despite several existing criteria, and it may be difficult to distinguish from pubertal changes. Various parameters to study ovarian function using ultrasonography have been proposed, but there is still no consensus about their diagnostic value.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of adolescent PCOS by reviewing available studies that assessed ovarian volume (OV) and other ovarian morphological features such as location and number of follicles, stromal area, and volume.

- **Methods**: The MEDLINE/PubMed database was searched to identify studies that assessed ovarian characteristics of adolescent PCOS patients by ultrasound. Studies on adults were also reviewed if the study population included adolescents, and stromal characteristics were assessed by three-dimensional (3D) sonogram.

- **Results**: Five studies, including 262 PCOS adolescents (10–19 years of age) with two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound analysis, were identified. The mean OV was 9.29 cm³ for PCOS patients and 4.77 cm³ for controls. The morphology of ovarian follicles, when reported, showed multiple (> 10) peripheral follicles in 83% of cases. Two studies, including 157 PCOS adolescents and young women (15–35 years of age) with 2D and 3D ultrasound analysis, were identified. Patients with PCOS had a mean OV of 13.1 cm³, multiple follicles (> 15), and a statistically significant greater S/A ratio compared to controls. Stromal volume indices were positively correlated with hyperandrogenemia in PCOS patients.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities [^112EPdra]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 4–21% depending on the diagnostic criteria used. A systematic review of 13 studies found a slightly higher estimate of the prevalence in Black and Middle-Eastern populations than in Chinese and White populations, although inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria and recruitment methods make comparisons between ethnic groups challenging.

The global disease burden seems to be increasing at a high rate. In 2019, an age-standardized point prevalence of 1677.8 per 100,000 and an annual incidence of 59.8 per 100,000 population were reported, based on data from 204 countries, representing increases of 30.4% and 29.5%, respectively, since 1990. The rising incidence, and accompanying morbidity, emphasizes the importance of recognizing polycystic ovary syndrome as an international public health priority.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and environmental toxins [^111HThMb]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common, heterogeneous, and multifactorial endocrine disorder in premenopausal women. The pathophysiology of this endocrinopathy remains unclear; however, the heterogeneity of its features across ethnicities, geographic locations, and families suggests that environment and lifestyle play a crucial role.

This work mainly focuses on the possible role of the most common and studied environmental toxins in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Plasticizers, such as bisphenol A (BPA) or phthalates, which are categorized as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), affect human health in everyday, industrialized life. Therefore, special attention should be paid to such exposure, especially as the timing of exposure to EDCs is crucial for the intensity of adverse health effects.

Fetuses, infants, and young children are now recognized as the most susceptible groups, particularly during early development. Prenatal exposure to EDCs that mimic endogenous hormones may contribute to altered fetal programming, leading to PCOS and other adverse health effects, potentially transgenerationally. Acute or prolonged exposure to EDCs and AGEs throughout different life stages may destabilize hormonal homeostasis and disrupt reproductive functions. They may also interfere with metabolic alterations, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which can exacerbate the PCOS phenotype and contribute to its consequences.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113k9CJ8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of between 8% to 13%, depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex, with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps. Women internationally have highlighted issues such as delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Existing guidelines are either limited in scope, do not follow rigorous best practices in development, lack consumer involvement, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike.

To address these identified gaps, we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS. This effort involved extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. The guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive, evidence-based guideline builds on prior high-quality guidelines and is the result of a rigorous, AGREEII-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice, with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. An extensive translation program further supports its implementation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112LT5Dv]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive-aged women in the United States, affecting approximately 7% of female patients. Although the pathophysiology of the syndrome is complex and there is no single defect from which it is known to result, it is hypothesized that insulin resistance is a key factor. Metabolic syndrome is twice as common in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome compared with the general population, and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are four times more likely than the general population to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Patient presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to having multiple gynecologic, dermatologic, or metabolic manifestations. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosis, which mandate the presence of two of the following three findings: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries, plus the exclusion of other diagnoses that could result in hyperandrogenism or ovulatory dysfunction. It is reasonable to delay evaluation for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent patients until two years after menarche. For this age group, it is also recommended that all three Rotterdam criteria be met before the diagnosis is made.

Patients who have marked virilization or rapid onset of symptoms require immediate evaluation for a potential androgen-secreting tumor. Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome is individualized based on the patient's presentation and desire for pregnancy. For patients who are overweight, weight loss is recommended.

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112NZozY]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

More than 1 out of 10 women worldwide are diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the leading cause of female reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Despite its high prevalence, PCOS and its accompanying morbidities are likely underdiagnosed, averaging more than two years and three physicians before women receive a diagnosis. Although it has been intensively researched, the underlying causes of PCOS have yet to be defined. There is an urgent need for safe and effective markers and treatments to understand PCOS pathophysiology, its developmental origins, and methods to predict and prevent its onset.

In this review, we detail which animal models are more suitable for contributing to our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of PCOS. We summarize and highlight the advantages and limitations of hormonal or genetic manipulation of animal models, as well as naturally occurring PCOS-like females.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^115jZysg]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder that affects about one in 15 women worldwide. The major endocrine disruption is excessive androgen secretion or activity, and a large proportion of women also have abnormal insulin activity. Many body systems are affected in polycystic ovary syndrome, resulting in several health complications, including menstrual dysfunction, infertility, hirsutism, acne, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Women with this disorder have an established increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a still debated increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The diagnostic traits of polycystic ovary syndrome are hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries, following the exclusion of other conditions that cause these same features. A conclusive definition of the disorder and the relative importance of the three diagnostic criteria remain controversial. The cause of polycystic ovary syndrome is unknown, but studies suggest a strong genetic component that is influenced by gestational environment, lifestyle factors, or both.

### Controversy in clinical endocrinology: Diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome: The Rotterdam criteria are premature [^112dsYi8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined most commonly according to the proceedings of an expert conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in April 1990, which noted the disorder as having: 1) hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia; 2) oligoovulation; and 3) exclusion of known disorders. Alternatively, another expert conference held in Rotterdam in May 2003 defined PCOS, after the exclusion of related disorders, by two of the following three features: 1) oligo- or anovulation; 2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; or 3) polycystic ovaries. In essence, the Rotterdam 2003 expanded the NIH 1990 definition creating two new phenotypes: 1) ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism; and 2) oligoanovulatory women with polycystic ovaries, but without hyperandrogenism.

The objective of this study was to ascertain the validity of using the Rotterdam 2003 criteria rather than the NIH 1991 criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS.

- **Intervention**: Interventions included the use of the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for diagnosing PCOS and, in particular, the proposal to define two new phenotypes as PCOS.

Available data suggest that hyperandrogenic ovulatory women with polycystic ovaries tend to have mild insulin resistance and mild evidence of ovarian dysfunction, although significantly less than women with anovulatory PCOS. However, whether these women will have an increased risk of infertility or metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, remains to be determined.

### Update on diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome during adolescence [^115b4Dtq]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic condition beginning during the peripubertal years. The international evidence-based guidelines and the update in 2023 have clearly defined the diagnostic criteria during adolescence, with the goal of decreasing controversies and challenges with the diagnosis during this critical life stage. In this narrative review, we aimed to examine the recent available data related to the diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. Specifically, we evaluated publications from August 2022 (date when the last searches were run for the update of the international evidence-based guidelines on PCOS) to May 2025.

Evidence supports the use of two main diagnostic criteria for adolescents: irregular menstrual cycles, well defined according to time post-menarche, and hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical, after excluding other conditions that mimic PCOS. In contrast to adult PCOS diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary morphology on pelvic ultrasound and/or antimullerian hormone levels should not be used for adolescent PCOS diagnosis. Accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence enables early screening and management of PCOS and its associated comorbidities.

Equally important is the early identification of adolescents considered "at risk" of PCOS (those who only meet one diagnostic criterion) as emerging evidence indicates increased metabolic risks and reinforces the need for long-term follow-up. Novel cluster analysis in well-defined adolescent cohorts is beginning to clarify threshold values for diagnostic purposes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1122qVFW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycystic ovary syndrome, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend performing a preconceptual assessment of BMI, BP, and oral glucose tolerance. This is due to the increased risk of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia, which are exacerbated by obesity in patients with PCOS.

### Metabolic screening in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome is largely underutilized among obstetrician-gynecologists [^113hYh4r]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome have substantially higher rates of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome compared to women without the disease. Given the high prevalence of these comorbidities, guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Endocrine Society recommend that all women with polycystic ovary syndrome undergo screening for impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. This includes a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting lipid profile upon diagnosis, with repeat screening every 2–5 years and every 2 years, respectively.

Although hemoglobin A1C and/or fasting glucose are widely used screening tests for diabetes, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Endocrine Society preferentially recommend the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test in women with polycystic ovary syndrome as a superior indicator of impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes mellitus. However, we found that gynecologists underutilize recommendations for metabolic screening in these women. In an online survey study targeting American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists fellows and junior fellows, 22.3% of respondents reported they would not order any screening test at the initial visit for at least 50% of their patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. The most common tests used to screen for impaired glucose tolerance in these women were hemoglobin A1C (51.0%) and fasting glucose (42.7%).

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and brain: An update on structural and functional studies [^115vQQp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age and is associated with reproductive, endocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological outcomes. All these disorders are thought to be affected by central mechanisms, which could be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of PCOS.

- **Evidence acquisition**: This mini-review discusses the relevance of central nervous system imaging modalities in understanding the neuroendocrine origins of PCOS, as well as their relevance to understanding its comorbidities.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Data suggest that the central nervous system plays a key role in the development of PCOS. Structural imaging modalities show decreased global and regional brain volumes and altered white matter microstructure in women with PCOS. Functional studies indicate diminished reward response in corticolimbic areas, brain glucose hypometabolism, and greater opioid receptor availability in reward-related regions in insulin-resistant patients with PCOS. These structural and functional disturbances are associated with nonhomeostatic eating, diminished appetitive responses, as well as cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders in women with PCOS.

- **Conclusion**: Structural and functional brain imaging is an emerging modality in understanding the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, as well as PCOS. Neuroimaging can help researchers and clinicians better understand the pathophysiology of PCOS and related comorbidities, as well as improve phenotyping of PCOS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111uWCrD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict of interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before they are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict of interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force.

Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.

Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (e.g. stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through The Endocrine Society office.

Funding for this guideline was derived solely from The Endocrine Society, and thus the Task Force received no funding or remuneration from commercial or other entities.

### The reproductive phenotype in polycystic ovary syndrome [^112JwwLd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The symptoms of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include hirsutism and irregular menstrual bleeding due to ovarian androgen excess and chronic anovulation. Typically, these features emerge late in puberty or shortly thereafter. The proposed mechanisms responsible for increased ovarian androgen production include heightened theca cell responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation, increased pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone, and hyperinsulinemia. The cause of ovulatory dysfunction is not well understood but is linked to abnormal follicle growth and development within the ovary. As a result, infertility is common among women with PCOS and, in many instances, is the initial presenting complaint. Insulin resistance and obesity are frequently associated with PCOS and probably contribute to the severity of symptoms.

The polycystic ovary that accompanies the syndrome has recently been defined as having 12 or more follicles per ovary or an ovarian volume greater than 10 ml, as determined by ultrasonography. In addition, there is an increased number of growing follicles in the polycystic ovary. Despite this distinctive appearance, the cause and development of the polycystic ovary are completely unknown.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114GbuAM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is primarily achieved through clinical history and physical findings. The principal features are hirsutism or biochemical evidence of excess androgen production and irregular menstrual bleeding caused by chronic anovulation. Associated findings include insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Ultrasound imaging of the ovary has facilitated the diagnosis. It is important to exclude conditions that may mimic PCOS, such as hyperthecosis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, Cushing's syndrome, as well as androgen-producing neoplasms. These disorders are usually revealed by appropriate laboratory assessment. Screening tests include measurement of serum total testosterone, DHEA sulfate, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, in obese individuals, determinations of glucose and insulin levels, as well as a lipid profile, are highly recommended.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^112N5i71]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) during adolescence is challenging because features of normal pubertal development overlap with adult diagnostic criteria. The international evidence-based PCOS guideline aimed to promote accurate and timely diagnosis, to optimize consistent care, and to improve health outcomes for adolescents and women with PCOS.

- **Methods**: International healthcare professionals, evidence synthesis teams, and consumers informed the priorities, reviewed published data, and synthesized the recommendations for the guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied to appraise the evidence quality and the feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and strength of the recommendations.

- **Results**: This paper focuses on the specific adolescent PCOS guideline recommendations. Specific criteria to improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid overdiagnosis include:
	1. Irregular menstrual cycles defined according to years post-menarche: > 90 days for any one cycle (> 1 year post-menarche), cycles > 45 days (> 1 to < 3 years post-menarche), cycles > 35 days (> 3 years post-menarche), and primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post-thelarche. Irregular menstrual cycles (< 1 year post-menarche) represent normal pubertal transition.
	2. Hyperandrogenism defined as hirsutism, severe acne, and/or biochemical hyperandrogenaemia confirmed using validated high-quality assays.
	3. Pelvic ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis of PCOS within 8 years post-menarche.
	4. Anti-Müllerian hormone levels not rec…

### Age of onset of polycystic ovarian syndrome in girls may be earlier than previously thought [^116KU2d6]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

To study the age at diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in a pediatric population and compare risk factors involved in causing PCOS in preadolescent and adolescent girls, a retrospective chart review and systematic review of the literature were conducted. The study involved 58 girls (ages ≤ 18 years) diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria. The participants were divided into two groups: preadolescents (< 13 years) and adolescents (13–18 years). Clinical and biochemical data were reviewed from the time of diagnosis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Differences in age at diagnosis and risk factors for PCOS, including ethnicity, obesity, family history of PCOS, birth weight, age at pubarche, thelarche, and menarche, as well as evidence of hyperandrogenism and/or insulin resistance, were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: The study found that 26% (15/58) of the participants were preadolescent girls (ages 9–12 years), while 74% (43/58) were adolescents (ages 13–18 years). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of ethnicity, BMI z-score, family history of maternal PCOS, birth weight, hyperandrogenism, or insulin resistance. However, preadolescents with PCOS experienced significantly earlier onset of pubarche and thelarche than adolescents, by 1.9 and 1.5 years, respectively (P = 0.018, 0.030). Additionally, PCOS developed 2.1 years sooner after thelarche in preadolescents compared to adolescents (P = 0.008). Preadolescents were significantly taller for their age than adolescents (72nd percentile vs. 43rd percentile) (P = 0.005). A review of the 28 studies published in recent years supports these findings.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^113zZMAM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder and represents the single most common endocrine-metabolic disorder in reproductive-aged women. There are currently four recognized phenotypes of PCOS: 1) hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology; 2) hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation; 3) hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology; and 4) oligo-anovulation and polycystic ovarian morphology. Each phenotype has different long-term health and metabolic implications. Clinicians should clearly denote a patient's phenotype when making the diagnosis of PCOS.

PCOS is a highly inherited complex polygenic, multifactorial disorder. Pathophysiological abnormalities in gonadotropin secretion or action, ovarian folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, insulin secretion or action, and adipose tissue function, among others, have been described in PCOS. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus; hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome; hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular thrombosis, cerebrovascular accidents, and possibly cardiovascular events; subfertility and obstetric complications; endometrial atypia or carcinoma; and possibly ovarian malignancy and mood and psychosexual disorders.

The evaluation of patients suspected of having PCOS includes a thorough history and physical examination, assessment for the presence of hirsutism, ovarian ultrasonography, and hormonal testing to confirm hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation as needed, while excluding similar or mimicking disorders.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and quality assessment study [^112Mm9gy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are key instruments in implementing evidence-based medicine. We aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and variations in CPGs' recommendations on diagnosing and managing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

- **Evidence acquisition**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until December 2020 for all evidence-based CPGs and consensus statements on PCOS. Data were extracted in duplicate to map clinical recommendations across prespecified disease domains, assessing the methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research & Evaluation II tool.

- **Evidence synthesis**: We included 13 PCOS CPGs published between 2007 and 2018. Recommendations were mostly focused on screening for and managing metabolic disease (12/13, 92%), followed by cardiovascular risk assessment (10/13, 77%). Mental health (8/13, 62%) and diagnosis in adolescents (7/13, 54%) were the least reported domains. Most CPGs were of high quality for scope and purpose description (12/13, 92%). However, stakeholder involvement and applicability of recommendations to clinical practice were appropriate in only 2 CPGs (2/13, 15%). Inconsistencies were identified in recommendations for PCOS diagnosis in adolescents, optimal lifestyle interventions, treatments for hirsutism and acne, interventions to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, the frequency and screening criteria for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and optimal screening tools for mental health illness in women with PCOS.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: A review for dermatologists: Part I. Diagnosis and manifestations [^113mUPS4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Its pathogenesis involves several hormonal pathways that lead to metabolic, reproductive, and cardiovascular effects. The hallmark features of hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia have systemic long-term implications. Dermatologists frequently evaluate and manage the cutaneous manifestations of PCOS such as acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, acne, and alopecia. Consequently, they play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition. In Part I of this continuing medical education article, we review the definition, etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of PCOS.
