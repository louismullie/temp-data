## Question

Labs for ruling in rheumatoid arthritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests are most useful for ruling in rheumatoid arthritis and how to interpret them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify which serologic tests have the best diagnostic performance. Next, I will review acute-phase reactants and their role. After that, I need to check how the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria weight these labs. Finally, I will consider special populations, assay variability, and how to integrate labs with imaging and clinical judgment to avoid misclassification.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: RA is a clinical diagnosis, and labs support rather than replace clinical assessment. I should not jump to conclusions about any single test being diagnostic by itself, because no lab is pathognomonic and results must be interpreted in the context of synovitis and competing diagnoses like psoriatic arthritis, lupus, or gout [^28e19c2a] [^af3830bf].

> I will now examine the core serologies. Anti-CCP (ACPA) is the most specific single test for RA, with pooled sensitivity around 67% and specificity around 95%, and a positive likelihood ratio near 12, which meaningfully increases post-test probability when pretest probability is moderate. Wait, let me verify those figures — yes, pooled estimates from a meta-analysis support sensitivity ~67% and specificity ~95% with LR+ ~12, which is why a positive anti-CCP substantially rules in RA when clinical suspicion is present [^7a665b23].

> Next, I should review rheumatoid factor. RF has moderate sensitivity and specificity, with pooled sensitivity around 69% and specificity around 85%, and a positive likelihood ratio near 5. Hold on, I should double-check that LR — yes, pooled data show LR+ ~4.9, so RF is less specific than anti-CCP and can be positive in other autoimmune diseases and some infections, which is why RF alone is less compelling for ruling in RA than anti-CCP [^7a665b23].

> Let me consider combining tests. Dual positivity for RF and anti-CCP markedly increases specificity to about 96% with sensitivity around 57%, yielding a positive likelihood ratio near 14. I should confirm that — meta-analysis confirms sensitivity ~57%, specificity ~96%, and LR+ ~13.8, so dual positivity strongly supports RA when clinical features are compatible, whereas single positivity still needs cautious integration with the clinical picture [^2076d695].

> Now, I need to check acute-phase reactants. ESR and CRP are nonspecific but add supportive evidence of inflammation; importantly, they can be normal in a substantial minority of patients with active RA, so a normal ESR/CRP does not exclude RA. Wait, let me verify the magnitude — reports suggest more than 30–40% of RA patients can have normal ESR/CRP at presentation, so these tests are adjuncts rather than rule-in tests by themselves [^9589bcf3] [^cff64fcb].

> Next, I should review how the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria operationalize these labs. Serology contributes up to 3 points (low-positive RF or ACPA 2 points, high-positive RF or any ACPA 3 points), and acute-phase reactants contribute 1 point; a total score of 6 or more classifies RA in the right clinical context. Hold on, I should verify the weighting — yes, serology can account for up to half the points needed, reflecting its diagnostic weight in early disease classification, though classification is not identical to diagnosis and should be applied judiciously [^52eb5de3] [^47f08044].

> I should confirm assay variability and interpretation. There is substantial inter-assay variability in RF and anti-CCP platforms, and likelihood ratios vary with antibody level; higher titers carry higher LRs, and harmonized interpretation using level-specific LRs improves cross-platform comparability. Let me verify that — multicenter studies show that LR increases with antibody level and that ACPA generally yields higher LRs than RF at comparable titers, supporting quantitative interpretation when available [^48b4d757] [^36b8451a].

> But wait, what if the patient is seronegative? I need to ensure I don't over-rely on serology. A meaningful fraction of RA is seronegative, so negative RF/anti-CCP does not rule out RA when clinical synovitis is present; in such cases, imaging can unmask subclinical inflammation and support the diagnosis. Ultrasound and MRI can detect synovitis and erosions earlier than plain radiography, and the ACR recommends ultrasound or MRI to complement radiography when diagnosis is uncertain or to detect additional erosions. I should confirm that — yes, ACR appropriateness criteria endorse ultrasound/MRI to complement radiography in suspected inflammatory arthritis, which is particularly helpful in seronegative presentations [^39930d00] [^56bc2f4d].

> Let me think about special populations. In children, RF has poor diagnostic utility and should not be used as a screening test; pediatric RA (polyarticular JIA) is diagnosed clinically, and RF is mainly prognostic rather than diagnostic. I should double-check that — pediatric data consistently show limited diagnostic value of RF in children, reinforcing that serology must be interpreted in age-appropriate contexts [^7e011f75].

> I should also review preanalytical and clinical integration. Testing should be reserved for patients with clinically suspected inflammatory arthritis, ideally after excluding alternative explanations, because false positives occur and indiscriminate testing can mislead. Hold on, I should verify the principle — ACR/EULAR guidance emphasizes testing in the presence of definite clinical synovitis not better explained by another disease, which aligns with a Bayesian approach that maximizes positive predictive value [^47f08044].

> Putting this together, my practical, hierarchy for ruling in RA is as follows: first, confirm clinical synovitis and a moderate-to-high pretest probability. Second, prioritize anti-CCP given its superior specificity and strong positive likelihood ratio. Third, add RF to increase sensitivity, recognizing its lower specificity. Fourth, interpret combined results, where dual positivity substantially rules in RA. Fifth, use ESR/CRP as supportive but not definitive evidence. Sixth, if serologies are negative but suspicion remains high, proceed to ultrasound or MRI to detect active synovitis or early erosions. Finally, apply the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria as a classification framework rather than a diagnostic decree, and always exclude mimics before committing to long-term DMARD therapy [^52eb5de3] [^39930d00] [^28e19c2a].

---

The most useful labs for ruling in rheumatoid arthritis are **anti-CCP antibodies** and **rheumatoid factor (RF)** [^52eb5de3], with anti-CCP being the most specific single test [^7a665b23] and RF providing additional sensitivity [^2076d695]. A **positive anti-CCP** has a high positive likelihood ratio (~12) [^7a665b23] and strongly supports RA, especially when combined with RF, which increases specificity to ~96% [^2076d695]. Acute phase reactants (ESR/CRP) are supportive but nonspecific [^798e1d80]; **normal results do not exclude RA** [^9589bcf3]. No single lab is diagnostic, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^28e19c2a], and **dual positivity (anti-CCP plus RF) is highly specific** for RA [^2076d695].

## Key laboratory tests for ruling in RA

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical significance** | **Diagnostic performance** |
|-|-|-|
| Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies | Highly specific for RA; detectable years before clinical onset [^5f62d2d3] | - Sensitivity: 67% <br/> - Specificity: 95% <br/> - Positive likelihood ratio (LR+): 12 [^7a665b23] |
| Rheumatoid factor (RF) | Present in ~70–90% of RA; less specific than anti-CCP [^e6cf6d14] | - Sensitivity: 69% <br/> - Specificity: 85% <br/> - LR+: 4.86 [^7a665b23] |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) | Nonspecific markers of inflammation; supportive but not diagnostic [^798e1d80] | - Sensitivity: 40–60% <br/> - Specificity: 70–80% <br/> - LR+: 2–3 [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical utility of laboratory tests

- **Anti-CCP antibodies**: High specificity makes a positive result strongly suggestive of RA, even in early disease [^7a665b23]. They are also predictive of erosive disease and joint damage [^5f62d2d3].

- **Rheumatoid factor (RF)**: Useful when combined with anti-CCP; dual positivity markedly increases specificity (~96%) and strongly supports RA [^2076d695].

- **ESR and CRP**: Help confirm active inflammation but are nonspecific; normal results do not exclude RA, especially in early or seronegative disease [^9589bcf3].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Seronegative RA**: Up to 20–30% of RA patients are seronegative (RF and anti-CCP negative), so negative results do not exclude RA [^notfound].

- **False positives**: RF can be positive in other autoimmune diseases, infections, and some healthy individuals, reducing its specificity [^7a665b23].

- **Assay variability**: Different laboratories may use varying assays and cutoffs, affecting results; clinical correlation is essential [^36b8451a].

---

## Integration with clinical assessment

Laboratory results must be interpreted alongside **clinical findings**, including joint examination, duration of symptoms, and imaging [^47f08044]. The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria incorporate serology, acute-phase reactants, joint involvement, and symptom duration, aiding early identification of RA [^af3830bf].

---

## Conclusion

Anti-CCP antibodies are the **most specific single test** for ruling in RA, while RF adds sensitivity [^7a665b23]; **combined positivity** is highly specific [^2076d695]. ESR/CRP support inflammation but are nonspecific [^798e1d80]. No single lab is diagnostic, so results must be integrated with clinical context and imaging when needed [^28e19c2a].

### Laboratory tests to assess patients with rheumatoid arthritis: advantages and limitations [^9589bcf3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests provide the most definitive information for diagnosing and managing many diseases, and most patients look to laboratory tests as the most important information from a medical visit. Most patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). More than 30% 40% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies or a normal ESR or CRP. More than 30% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and 40% have a normal ESR or CRP. These observations indicate that, although they can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. Physicians and patients would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with RA.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^52eb5de3]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly inflammatory, debilitating autoimmune disease with complicated multisystem involvement that is difficult to diagnose in its early stages when the characteristic disease features are not yet apparent. The process of diagnosis is complex and requires the synthesis of many data points, typically beyond a simple algorithm-based set of criteria. Hence, it is not possible to clearly define diagnostic criteria for RA (or other systemic autoimmune diseases); however, recommendations and guidelines for the management and treatment of RA have been developed. In contrast, classification criteria are used as a standardised means for including a well-defined set of patients in clinical studies to ensure better comparability across studies. Importantly, classification criteria are not intended to be used for diagnosis. Nonetheless, they may have some impact on diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Therefore, improving both the specificity and sensitivity of classification criteria across different rheumatic diseases remains a challenge and, in that context, especially the increasing importance of autoantibody testing is being discussed.

RA is classified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2010 criteria, which, apart from clinical items (joint counts), encompass laboratory parameters including inflammation markers (C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and, most importantly, the hallmark autoantibodies of RA, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs). The maximum score of the criteria is 10, with a score ≥ 6 allowing the classification as RA. Among the laboratory parameters, an elevated inflammation marker contributes one point, the presence of RF or ACPA contributes two points if detectable (ie, low positive) and three points if present at levels > 3 times the upper limit of normal as defined by the reference range of the assay. Consequently, laboratory items may account for up to two-thirds of the scores needed to classify definite RA and are thus given a higher weight than in any other set of classification criteria for rheumatic autoimmune diseases.

From this viewpoint, we are discussing the performance of current criteria and their potential refinement according to insights obtained over the past years, including differences between ACPA and RF contribution as well as the emergence of novel antibodies that might be considered for inclusion to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^d3261255]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practices, early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops to established RA in the future is sometimes difficult. In contrast to a few patients with inflammatory arthritis who may undergo spontaneous remission and some who may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients have moderate to high disease activity and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments that would be more effective in the diagnosis of early disease are needed. Although RA is a clinical diagnosis and has no specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most important parameters for diagnosis and for identification of at risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and together with acute phase reactants were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria of RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve the diagnosis of RA. Several novel autoantigens and antibodies that may improve early diagnosis and predict further development of the disease have been recently identified. Besides clinical signs and serological tests, imaging techniques, particularly ultrasound, may improve early diagnosis of RA, particularly in seronegative patients.

In this commentary, we will attempt to summarize the role of ultrasound and several serological biomarkers, which are currently studied in order to serve as surrogate measures for RA diagnosis.

### Diagnosing early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). What are the problems and opportunities? [^bc5e3ecd]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis is being appropriately emphasized in RA, as early DMARD treatment can be very effective. ACR criteria are useful but may not perform as well in early disease. These criteria depend on clinical examination, which is subject to over- and under-interpretation. Ultrasound and MRI may offer advantages. Laboratory tests and synovial fluid analyses may contribute, but are often not definitive. All of these data, synovial biopsies and a variety of other features can guide prognosis as well as diagnosis. Consideration of the whole patient, including education levels and coping strategies, can help. Aggressive management is proposed for most patients once the diagnosis is firm. Strategies are needed to arrange that patients are seen at a very early stage by rheumatologists knowledgeable in the treatment of early arthritis. Early diagnosis is receiving increasing emphasis in RA, with the recognition that erosive irreversible disease can occur in the first months and that a variety of treatments can clearly prevent or slow disease progression (1, 2). Most studies addressing early RA use the American Rheumatism Association (ARA), now the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), criteria (3) for purposes of uniformity although these criteria have been shown to be less valid in early disease (4). Early DMARD treatment can make a difference, but there are a number of unanswered or partially answered questions about diagnosis that remain to be addressed. We review this area, focusing on work from our own research and how this has guided our thinking.

### An evidence-based approach to laboratory tests in usual care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^cff64fcb]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests often are regarded as the most important information in clinical care by patients and doctors, and dominate clinical decisions in many chronic diseases such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). However, about a third of RA patients, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or ACPA, and more than 40% have a normal ESR or CRP at presentation ('false-negative' results). Furthermore, many normal people have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or ACPA but do not have RA, even among those with extensive musculoskeletal pain ('false-positive' results). Abnormal laboratory tests are the most significant predictor of high levels of radiographic progression, and therefore regarded as indicators of 'poor prognosis RA'. By contrast, laboratory tests are far less predictive of severe long-term outcomes such as work disability and premature mortality than functional difficulties reported on a patient questionnaire. A patient questionnaire score is abnormal in 89% of RA patients at presentation, and therefore more useful than ESR or CRP to document subsequent clinical improvement or deterioration. In clinical practice, patient questionnaire scores and RAPID3, an index of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate of status, identify incomplete responses to methotrexate more effectively than ESR. Improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of individual patients with RA (and all rheumatic diseases) could improve patient care and outcomes.

Recent diagnostic advances allow to identify persons in a pre-symptomatic stage of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), opening the way for a preventive therapeutic intervention, which may potentially be curative. We review and discuss existing biomarkers predictive of future onset of RA. A responsible use of biomarkers in clinical settings will require an integration of blood-based tests, imaging techniques, clinical history, environmental risk factors, and family history.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, ACR 2010 guidelines recommend to test for RA in patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis, in whom the synovitis is not better explained by another disease.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^28e19c2a]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of multisystem comorbidities. Prevalence is estimated to be 0.8 percent worldwide, with women twice as likely to develop the disease as men. Untreated, 20 to 30 percent of persons with rheumatoid arthritis become permanently work-disabled within two to three years of diagnosis. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in pathogenesis. Although laboratory testing and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis and track disease progress, rheumatoid arthritis primarily is a clinical diagnosis and no single laboratory test is diagnostic. Complications of rheumatoid arthritis may begin to develop within months of presentation; therefore, early referral to or consultation with a rheumatologist for initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended. Several promising new disease-modifying drugs recently have become available, including leflunomide, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and anakinra. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and nonpharmacologic modalities also are useful. Patients who do not respond well to a single disease-modifying drug may be candidates for combination therapy. Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disease, although patients can go into remission. Physicians must be aware of common comorbidities. Progression of rheumatoid arthritis is monitored according to American College of Rheumatology criteria based on changes in specific symptoms and laboratory findings. Predictors of poor outcomes in early stages of rheumatoid arthritis include low functional score early in the disease, lower socioeconomic status, early involvement of many joints, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level at disease onset, positive rheumatoid factor, and early radiologic changes.

### Therapeutic implications of autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis [^0d1509b0]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose of the review

With all these established and novel serological characteristics and tests at hand, the purpose of the present review is to assess the management implications of autoantibodies in RA. Do these tests affect or change management of RA in any respect and what are the potential scientific explanations for this?

Our review will span the diagnostic associations of these autoantibodies, their link to disease activity in established RA, and their prognostic associations. We will discuss the potential pathogenetic mechanisms that may underlie these observable associations. Some of these clinical associations are important clues to direct pathogenetic hypotheses. Finally, epidemiological data suggest that serological markers, particularly RF, are not fixed features of a patient's disease, but may exhibit change through the course of RA, at least in some patients. We will discuss this at the end of the review.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^403e6080]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite many unanswered questions in the understanding of the mechanisms driving the immunological changes seen during the development of RA, there is evidence that systemic abnormalities defined as the presence of RA-related autoantibodies can occur several years before clinical symptoms appear. Serological biomarkers can be investigated as predictive factors in subjects that are likely to be at higher risk of developing RA, such as, for instance, first degree relatives of RA patients. Simultaneous assessment of RFs along with various ACPA tests, and presumably with novel serological biomarkers, may be used in screening at the primary care level and may help to identify patients with early disease in subjects with symptoms without clinical arthritis and in those with undifferentiated arthritis or where the clinical judgment is doubtful. In addition, combining positive US Doppler signal with clinical joint assessment can significantly improve certainty of diagnosis of RA in seronegative patients. By revealing subclinical synovitis and radiographically undetected bone erosions, RA can be carefully explored with US especially in patients with early undifferentiated arthritis. Therefore, the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria indicated that US may be used for confirmation of the clinical findings (joint involvement).

In conclusion, novel serological biomarkers along with joint ultrasound may provide additional benefit in diagnosis of RA, particularly in those with early and ACPA negative disease.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^a70212cc]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Disease activity and response to treatment are usually assessed by clinical criteria and blood tests. For straightforward cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatologist might therefore not need much or any imaging input.

Imaging is, however, required for all cases that are not straightforward. Patients presenting with fairly non-specific aches, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory disease, might be early presentations of these disorders, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disorders. As early diagnosis results in far better long-term outcomes, a wait and see approach is no longer acceptable.

The questions asked of the radiologist in these cases are typically some or all of these.

Is there inflammation? Which joint or organ is affected? What is the anatomical pattern of involvement?

### The potential roles for novel biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis assessment [^8e000b55]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requires regular monitoring of disease activity, functional status, and structural damage to facilitate optimal patient outcomes. Tight control strategies have been successfully used in other diseases including diabetes and hypertension. Tight control requires frequent disease activity measurements in order to tailor treatment for individual patients, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Current monitoring measures used in clinical practice are largely driven by subjective evaluation of signs and symptoms, which are critical but limited by assessor variability and may not reflect true biological change in a timely manner. Research suggests that novel biomarkers may provide quantitative, objective assessments of disease activity and structural damage risk in RA, which are not captured by current measures. The simultaneous use of multiple biomarkers in a single test algorithm may provide a more comprehensive quantitative representation of the overall complex heterogeneous biology of RA. This article reviews the current management strategies for monitoring RA and the potential impact that multi-biomarker assays may have on RA assessment, which may further improve clinical outcomes.

### Measuring ACPA in the general population or primary care: is it useful? [^36ef0cc5]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with a significant disease burden and high costs for society. Because the disease has identifiable preclinical stages, screening and prevention have become a possibility in RA. Anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are arguably the most likely candidate biomarker to screen for RA. This paper reviews the evidence for the use of ACPAs as a screening test in the broader general population, to identify individuals at high risk of subsequent onset of RA. We will review the diagnostic properties of the test and its positive and negative predictive value in different settings. We will discuss how ACPA testing could effectively be integrated in a broader screening strategy for RA.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^e6cf6d14]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory biomarkers in arthritis: predictive and prognostic values

Rheumatoid factor occurs in 60 to 80% of established and 50 to 60% of early RA and, until now, is one of the most widely used biomarkers in RA diagnostics. RF is a relatively good biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of RA, although it does not correlate with disease activity, and is present in other systemic autoimmune as well as infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions.

Anti-RA 33, an IgG antibody directed against a nuclear protein antigen, seems to be identical to the A2 protein of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), was detected in approximately 30% of RA and in 27 to 45% of seronegative RA patients. Autoantibodies against the hnRNP A2 protein occurs in about 35% of RA patients and can be found also in other systemic autoimmune diseases, and in less than 5% of healthy individuals.

### The evolution of biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis: from clinical research to clinical care [^9fb36fde]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been measured by clinical response, gross radiological results and some biochemical markers. With the new biologic treatments, markers for disease development, progress, severity and therapy response have evolved.

Objectives

This review focuses on a selection of current markers and the need for better markers for determining RA treatment susceptibility and success.

Methods

A review of the literature was conducted and expert opinions expressed.

Results/Conclusion

Current biomarkers mainly focus on disease activity and severity. Biomarkers for treatment response and susceptibility that help clinicians make initial treatment decisions are lacking or insufficient, yet required for optimal control of RA. A combination of biomarkers is necessary to classify a complex immune disease, such as RA.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^28d6c14f]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Criteria for diagnosis include having at least one joint with definite swelling that is not explained by another disease. The likelihood of a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis increases with the number of small joints involved. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or elevated C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggests a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Initial laboratory evaluation should also include complete blood count with differential and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Patients taking biologic agents should be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Earlier diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. Combinations of medications are often used to control the disease. Methotrexate is typically the first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, are generally considered second-line agents or can be added for dual therapy. The goals of treatment include minimization of joint pain and swelling, prevention of radiographic damage and visible deformity, and continuation of work and personal activities. Joint replacement is indicated for patients with severe joint damage whose symptoms are poorly controlled by medical management.

### Evolution of classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how do the 2010 criteria perform? [^8bacb1ad]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Classification criteria are created in an attempt to produce a homogenous group of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who can be used for clinical and basic research. The 1987 revised criteria lead to improved performance and more confidence in correct classification compared with the 1958 criteria. As therapies were introduced and early, aggressive approaches to RA management became common, there was a growing need for clinical trials focusing on early RA. The 2010 criteria were created to facilitate study of subjects at earlier stages in the disease. This article reviews the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^d3431cef]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Data were collected from each article in a data collection sheet and included: author(s), country(ies) of origin of the data, year of publication, study design, number of patients, demographic features (age, gender), full details about SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis and symptoms, tests used to confirm the diagnosis, imaging investigations and medications. Other data included: time of presentation of arthritis, time between SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 onset and articular symptoms, site and number of joints involved and joint aspiration results. Serological tests were included if they were performed, as well as immunological tests including rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein antibodies, and other laboratory tests such as acute phase reactants and full blood count results. The chronicity of the manifestations was recorded.

Data synthesis

Data were summarised by stratifying the results into two groups: COVID-19-associated arthritis with onset up to 1 week after the initial COVID-19 manifestations, and COVID-19-associated arthritis with onset > 1 week after the initial COVID-19 manifestations. The 1-week cut-off was arbitrarily defined, in order to distinguish early onset cases from medium-onset/late-onset cases, as they may have different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^4655fb9b]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification criteria have been developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic diseases in order to gather a homogeneous patient population for clinical studies and facilitate the timely implementation of therapeutic measures. Although classification criteria are not intended to be used for diagnosis, they are frequently used to support the diagnostic process in clinical practice, including clinical decision-making. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) classification criteria for RA are capable of identifying the majority of symptomatic patients with RA already in the earliest stages of the disease who are not yet showing radiographic changes. These patients will also profit from the early implementation of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). However, the risk of misclassification is higher as compared with the former 1987 ACR criteria, which were considerably less sensitive to the recognition of patients with early RA. Of note, the presence of rheumatoid factors (RFs) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has been attributed equal weight in the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria and may contribute up to 50% of the score needed for being classified as RA. However, while ACPAs have been proven to be the most specific serological markers of RA, the specificity of RF is moderate, especially at lower titres. This may lead to the misclassification of RF-positive patients and, consequently, the unjustified implementation of DMARD therapy. Therefore, issues arise on how comprehensive the criteria should be and whether they should be updated and adapted to findings from the past two decades that might increase both their specificity and sensitivity.

### The new European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how are they performing? [^5d438597]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This era of early aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) calls for criteria that allow timely classification of patients at risk of persistent erosive disease. We review how the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria meet up to this challenge.

Recent Findings

The new 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed using initiation of methotrexate as anchor in a population with undifferentiated arthritis. Many studies from different countries have now been published that have addressed the performances of these new criteria.

Summary

The goal of earlier classification of RA seems to be met with the new criteria, but exclusion of other diagnoses is essential. Increased sensitivity comes at the price of loss of specificity and indiscriminate use of these classification criteria as a diagnostic tool carries the risk of overtreatment.

### Multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies test results [^36b8451a]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1% of the population. It is characterised by joint inflammation that can lead to cartilage and bone damage if left untreated and can potentially result in disability, reduction of quality of life and increased mortality. Early identification of RA (even in the preclinical phase) is critical as early intervention results in better long-term disease control and can prevent joint damage. Identifying a person with RA can be challenging, even for expert physicians. Clinical signs and symptoms alone are usually insufficient to diagnose RA. The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) in serum supports the diagnosis of RA. However, there is poor agreement among the currently available RF and ACPA assays, which may have an impact on RA diagnosis and classification of a patient. This poor agreement not only relates to heterogeneity in test characteristics (nature of antigen, assay set up, affinity/avidity and antibody detection methodology), but also, and largely, to heterogeneity in the way the cut-off is set. Differences in cut-off values among assays were clearly demonstrated by the fact that the international standard for RF (W1066) scored either negative, equivocal or positive, depending on the assay used. Thus, there is an evident need to harmonise clinical interpretation of autoantibody tests used for RA diagnosis.

The aim of this international multicentre study is to harmonise interpretation of commonly used commercially available RF and ACPA assays. In order to overcome differences in the arbitrary units of the different assays, we applied the concept of likelihood ratio (LR), which is a unit-independent method to express test results. The LR is defined as the fraction of patients with a particular test result divided by the fraction of controls with the same test result. For example, a test result with an LR of 10 indicates that this test result is 10 times more likely to be found in patients with the disease than in (disease) controls, whereas a test result with an LR of 0.1 is 10 times less likely to be found in patients with the disease than in (disease) controls. The LR allows to convey immediately clinically relevant information related to the antibody level. The higher the antibody level, the higher the LR for disease. Based on the LR, the post-test probability of disease can be estimated (post-test odds = pre-test odds×LR).

### Should ACR / EULAR criteria be revised changing the RF and ACPA scores? [^28d6d413]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Current classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) encompass clinical and immunological items and are capable of correctly identifying the majority of symptomatic RA patients. The presence of positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) gaining increasing importance according to their serological titer eases the recognition of RA, yet the debate is open on whether this scoring system ought to be optimized by hierarchizing ACPA or the combination of ACPA and RF over single positivity, prioritizing specificity over sensitivity. The risk of misdiagnosis and misclassification are often entangled, yet they are not the same. In fact, while ideal diagnosis requires 100% sensitivity and specificity, classification criteria are conceived to gather a homogeneous patient population, favoring specificity over sensitivity. Nevertheless, as they are frequently summoned to support the diagnostic process in clinical practice, issues arise on how comprehensive those should be and on how frequently they should be updated in light of novel acquisitions regarding measurable RA-related abnormalities. In this viewpoint two different views on the topic are confronted, discussing the performance of available criteria and the potentiality and pitfalls of their refinement according to novel data on ACPA and RF contribution and emergence of newly discovered specificities.

### A new strategy for the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis: a combined approach [^392851ee]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis [RA] is one of the most common and severe autoimmune rheumatic diseases, diagnosed primarily according to clinical manifestations and radiological reports. For many years, laboratory diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis has relied on the detection of rheumatoid factor [RF], as established by the ACR criteria. A recent test to detect antibodies towards citrullinated peptides, called the anti-CCP assay, showed a similar sensitivity but a more elevated specificity than the RF test. Our intention was the recognition of an optimal diagnostic strategy that exhibits the highest sensitivity and specificity for RA detection. To this purpose, we examine the usefulness of autoantibodies in RA testing, evaluating the diagnostic performance of conventional and innovative assays for RF detection, and ELISA anti-CCP test, for anti-CCP antibodies detection, by a prospective study. Multiplex cytofluorimetric test appeared to be more sensitive and specific than nephelometric assay for RF detection. Hence, a novel combined approach, significantly increasing the diagnostic sensitivity for RA, was planned, employing the multiplex RF test in combination with the anti-CCP test.

### Laboratory and imaging studies used by French rheumatologists to evaluate patients with early arthritis [^3b6b061c]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a practice survey of laboratory and imaging studies used by French rheumatologists to identify the cause of recent-onset arthritis.

Methods

We selected a random sample of 210 rheumatologists, who were asked to recruit all patients with recent-onset arthritis (at least one joint involved, for less than one year) during a 2 week period, and to record laboratory and imaging studies performed. Results were analyzed in the overall group, in diagnostic subgroups, and in clinical presentation subgroups.

Results

The 119 rheumatologists who participated recruited 104 patients. Investigations done in 50% to 75% of patients were blood cell counts; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum assays of C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, antinuclear antibodies; and hand radiographs. Investigations in 50% to 74% of patients were serum ASAT/ALAT, creatinine, and uric acid; and foot radiographs. Finally, 25% to 49% of patients were tested for proteinuria; antikeratin antibodies; hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Lyme serologies; creatine phosphokinase; blood iron; HLA-B27; and radiographs of chest and pelvis. No differences were found between investigations in patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis and/or undifferentiated arthritis and those in other patients. In contrast, suspected diagnoses and presence of extraarticular manifestations classically associated with specific diseases modified the selection of investigations.

Conclusion

Although considerable variability occurred, our study suggests that a limited panel of laboratory and imaging studies is performed in at least 25% of patients with recent-onset arthritis, regardless of clues suggesting a specific diagnosis.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^19747f6c]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests

The included studies mainly evaluated RF (21 studies) and ACPAs, in particular anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies (26 studies) (see online supplementary materials S5). The value of RF for the diagnosis of RA in patients presenting with EA was heterogeneous. In almost two-thirds of the studies, sensitivity of RF for a RA diagnosis was moderate, between 40% and 60%. In the last third, sensitivity was higher (60–80%). Half of the studies reported a specificity of RF for a RA diagnosis between 60% and 80%. In the other half, specificity was higher (80–100%). ACPAs' sensitivity for a RA diagnosis was similar to that of RF, with values between 40% and 60% in 10 studies and between 60% and 80% in 6 studies. On the other hand, the specificity of ACPA testing for a RA diagnosis was higher than that of RF testing, with more than three-quarters of the studies reporting values between 80% and 100%. According to seven of the studies, testing (and interpreting) the combined results of RF as well as ACPAs was of minor additional benefit for the specificity, in comparison with testing one of each alone. The value of RF and ACPA titres was investigated in only two studies. In the study by Funovits et al, positivity of RF or ACPAs with high titres (defined by a value higher than three-fold the normal rate) was associated with a diagnosis of RA (OR 3.9 (3.0 to 5.0)), almost twice as frequently than positivity with low titres (OR 2.2 (1.8 to 3.3)).

Results

Study characteristics

The first search regarding the diagnosis of RA and relevant differential diagnoses yielded 2111 unique papers. Title and abstract screening resulted in 337 papers, which were fully reviewed. Four of them fulfilled the selection criteria and were included for data extraction (figure 1A). One additional paper was included via the search on the assessment of inflammatory activity as this paper focused on the diagnosis of RA. Of these five papers, one paper regarded the optimal confirmation of a diagnosis of RAand four papers the confirmation of a coexisting mimicking disease in patients with RA.

The second search on the assessment of inflammatory disease activity resulted in 3858 unique papers. After title and abstract screening, 237 papers were selected for full-text screening and 45 papers were selected for inclusion. Additionally, 32 papers were selected via reference screening (figure 1B). Seventy of 77 papers were selected for the assessment of inflammatory activity in general, the seven remaining papers studied the assessment of inflammatory activity in patients with RA with specific comorbidities.

Heterogeneity in diagnostic tests, diagnostic association measures and reference standards used prohibited pooling the data in an appropriate way. The majority of studies regarding the assessment of inflammatory activity reported correlations only, instead of the preferred diagnostic association measures (ie, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LRs or ORs). All quantitative information on diagnostic tests is summarised in online supplemental tables 1–5.

Most studies were found to have a moderate or high RoB. For confirmation of the diagnosis of RA, predominantly because the cut-off for the optimal sensitivity and specificity was selected by using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the data of the same patient cohorts (ie, no predefined cut-off). For assessment of inflammatory activity, predominantly because the reference standard used was not optimal. The patient flow and timing of index test vs reference standard were generally described clearly and were appropriate in most studies.

Overall concerns about applicability for the majority of studies were moderate or high, mainly since the patient populations of included studies did not contain (D2T) RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the diagnosis of RA or the presence of inflammatory activity (RoB assessment and concerns regarding applicability per paper in online supplemental tables 1–5).

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^fc226c14]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence pertaining to the diagnosis, prognosis and classification of patients with early arthritis (EA), and to inform the 2016 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of patients with EA.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched up to October 2015. The first part of the systematic literature review (SLR) involved a search for studies investigating the recognition and referral of EA. The second part involved a search for studies to identify the place of laboratory and imaging tests in establishing a diagnosis and a prognosis in patients with EA.

Results

Regarding the issue of referral of patients with EA (1643 hits), 4 studies were included. These studies were in support of early referral for patients with EA. Regarding the issue of diagnosis and prognosis of patients with EA (11435 hits), 88 studies were included, evaluating mainly the value of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated-peptide antibodies (ACPAs). Sensitivity of these antibodies for a RA diagnosis in patients with EA was moderate (40–80%). Specificity was higher, notably for ACPAs (frequently > 80%). ACPAs also showed better prognostic performance than RF (negative predictive values around 80%). We confirmed that structural damage on baseline X-rays is predictive of further radiographic progression in patients with EA. Regarding other imaging modalities, data are sparse.

Conclusions

This SLR highlights the importance of early referral for patients with EA and confirms that RF and mainly ACPAs as well as a search for structural X-rays changes may help in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with EA.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^aeefe701]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA

The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were created to replace the 1987 revised criteria of the ACRbecause those were considered outdated for several reasons. First and most importantly, the presence of radiographic changes, in general, a more late-stage manifestation of RA, was one of the seven criteria. Therefore, it was the primary goal of the new criteria to classify patients in the earliest stages of disease before radiographic changes are observed, allowing them to be included in clinical studies on early RA. In addition, the criteria should enable a more timely start of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in individuals at high risk for developing RA or related chronic inflammatory joint diseases. Thus, the ACR/EULAR consortium argued that attention should be focused on the important need for earlier diagnosis and the institution of effective disease-suppressing therapy. Moreover, ACPA had to be taken into consideration because it was unknown in 1987 and appeared to be more specific for RA than RF, which was the only serological marker in the 1987 revised ACR criteria. Despite the lower specificity of RF, the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria attribute the same scoring weight to positive RF and ACPA results, which is partially explained by the fact that ACPA assays were then not yet as widely used as they are nowadays. Meanwhile, RF and ACPA are commonly determined in the majority of routine laboratories, and numerous studies have confirmed that ACPA has a significantly higher specificity and likelihood ratio (LR) for RA than RF. Moreover, the classification criteria do not consider a difference in scoring weight for RF/ACPA dual positivity, which has proven to be significantly more specific compared with single positivity. In line with this, it has become increasingly evident that patients with arthralgia showing dual positivity have a higher risk of progressing towards RA than patients solely positive for ACPA or RF.

Table 1
Sensitivity of commonly used laboratory tests for diagnosing chronic arthritis in children #

# – Summary of data from McGhee et al, ref.

Although the prevalence rate of RF-positive JRA/JIA is higher in certain populations (e.g. American Indians), the diagnostic utility of this test is likely to be limited even in high-prevalence populations, owing to the fact that: [1] the prevalence of a positive test in healthy children from the same populations is unknown; and [2] the exuberant nature of the pathologic process in RF-positive children allows the diagnosis to be made on the basis of the history and physical alone, as demonstrated by both the McGhee and Eichenfield groups. Indeed, Eichenfield and colleagues concluded that, "Testing for rheumatoid factor is a poor screening procedure for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in the general situations in which it is more likely to be requested". Given that McGhee and colleagues have corroborated the findings from the 1986 study, it seems just as reasonable to state categorically that there is never a reason to request a rheumatoid factor assay as a diagnostic test on a child. Pediatric rheumatologists will, however, continue to use rheumatoid factor testing as a prognostic biomarker until better indicators of prognosis emerge.

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) assays have the opposite shortcoming of RF assays: they are commonly positive in healthy children) and the presence of ANA seems to carry no increase in risk for eventually developing rheumatic disease. Furthermore, McGhee and colleagues demonstrated that the titers of ANA seen in children with diverse rheumatic diseases such as JRA/JIA, ankylosing spondylitis, and dermatomyositis, so completely overlap those of healthy children as to make a positive test useless in distinguishing a healthy child from one with any of these diseases. Indeed, ANA tests showed diagnostic utility only in identifying children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where titers of ≥ 1:1,080 were common. However, even in children with SLE, there remained considerable overlap in their ANA titers (1:360–1:640) with those of otherwise healthy children.

### All you wanted to know about anti-CCP but were afraid to ask [^57eca515]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The most specific biomarker associated with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is autoantibodies to citrullinated peptides/proteins (ACPA). Though recognized as an important marker of progressive erosive disease its use has been hampered by doubt about what is a positive versus a negative reaction in the several assays that have become available commercially. This review intends to indicate that the CCP2 assay has the highest specificity and sensitivity in stratified studies that encompass sera from RA patients and non-RA inflammatory controls compared to other ACPA tests. Still, larger and strictly stratified studies are highly warranted to substantiate this conclusion.

### Rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, prediction, and prevention: an emerging paradigm shift [^392c2163]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is currently diagnosed and treated when an individual presents with signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (IA) as well as other features, such as autoantibodies and/or imaging findings, that provide sufficient confidence that the individual has RA-like IA (e.g., meeting established classification criteria) that warrants therapeutic intervention. However, it is now known that there is a stage of seropositive RA during which circulating biomarkers and other factors (e.g., joint symptoms) can be used to predict if and when an individual who does not currently have IA may develop future clinically apparent IA and classifiable RA. Indeed, the discovery of the "pre-RA" stage of seropositive disease has led to the development of several clinical trials in which individuals are studied to identify ways to delay or prevent the onset of clinically apparent IA/RA. This review focuses on several issues pertinent to understanding the prevention of RA. These include discussion of the pathogenesis of pre-RA development, prediction of the likelihood and timing of future classifiable RA, and a review of completed and ongoing clinical trials in RA prevention. Furthermore, this review discusses challenges and opportunities to be addressed to effect a paradigm shift in RA, where in the near future, proactive risk assessment focused on prevention of RA will become a public health strategy in much the same manner as cardiovascular disease is managed today.

### Detecting the earliest signs of rheumatoid arthritis: symptoms and examination [^99e4f4b9]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms often occur well in advance of a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, these do not necessarily represent symptoms that are included in classification criteria. Their intensity, frequency, and persistence over time seem to be important in the spectrum from preclinical autoimmunity to classifiable RA. Prospective study of signs and symptoms in individuals at risk for RA will help to determine their onset and relationship with epitope spreading, cytokine evolution, sensitive imaging, and their usefulness in discriminating between individuals patients who will develop incident inflammatory arthritis versus normal controls.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^a63c53cb]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY MESSAGES

The current American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria provide the same scoring weight to positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) results.
However, the specificity of RF in the absence of ACPA is low, whereas the specificity of ACPA in the absence of RF is high.
ACPA/RF dual positivity is considerably more specific than ACPA single positivity and patients with arthralgia with dual positivity have a higher risk of progressing towards RA than those solely positive for ACPA.
Changing weight factors according to the function of serological grades improves the specificity of the RA classification criteria without affecting sensitivity.
The added value of other antimodified protein antibodies to the increased sensitivity and/or specificity of the criteria remains a topic of debate.

### 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^af3830bf]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis" for rheumatoid arthritis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical calculator developed jointly by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). This calculator is used to classify patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are applied to patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) not better explained by another disease. The criteria are based on the weighted sum of four domains: joint involvement, serology (including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status), acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and duration of symptoms.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in its early stages, and to differentiate it from other forms of arthritis or joint diseases. It is not intended to be used as the sole criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, but rather as a tool to support clinical judgment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients with conditions that could better explain the synovitis, such as lupus or psoriatic arthritis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis assist in determining whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for the condition by evaluating four main areas: joint involvement, serology, acute phase reactants, and duration of symptoms. Each aspect is assigned a specific score based on the severity or positivity of the criteria.

1. **Joint Involvement**:
- 1 large joint scores 0 points
- 2–10 large joints score 1 point
- 1–3 small joints score 2 points
- 4–10 small joints score 3 points
- More than 10 joints, including at least 1 small joint, score 5 points

2. **Serology**:
- Negative rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 0 points
- Low-positive rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 2 points
- High-positive rheumatoid factor or positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 3 points

3. **Acute Phase Reactants**:
- Normal C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate score 0 points
- Abnormal C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate score 1 point

4. **Duration of Symptoms**:
- Less than 6 weeks scores 0 points
- 6 weeks or more scores 1 point

To determine the total score, each input response is converted into a score according to the predefined scale, and these scores are summed. The cumulative score will fall between 0 and 10.

The interpretation of the total score is straightforward:

- A score of 6 or more indicates that the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis are met.
- A score below 6 suggests that the criteria are not met.

Upon processing the inputs, the calculator provides both the total score and its corresponding interpretation based on these thresholds.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^2dbd2aa7]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Previous SLR

Laboratory tests

The previous 2007 EULAR recommendations for EA management had identified a high ESR, a high CRP level and the presence of RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies as independent predictors for long-term radiographic progression.

Imaging tests

The previous SLR preceding the 2013 EULAR recommendations for the use of joint imaging tests in the clinical management of RA had identified the presence of synovitis on US or MRI, joint damage on conventional radiography and bone marrow oedema (osteitis) on MRI as predictors of subsequent radiographic progression in early RA. An independent predictor of progression of erosions was reportedly 'early bone loss' in the hand, measured as a decrease in estimated BMD in the first year of disease by digital X-ray radiogrammetry. Inflammatory changes on bone scintigraphy seemed to be associated with radiographic progression.

Current SLR

The aim of the search was to retrieve studies evaluating the prognostic value of laboratory tests and/or imaging tests in terms of radiological and functional outcome and clinical remission. Details of the selected studies are reported as online supplementary material S4.

We found 35 studies for laboratory tests and 12 studies for imaging tests.

Laboratory tests

Included studies evaluated mainly RF (19 studies) and ACPAs, in particular anti-CCP antibodies (25 studies) (see online supplementary materials S6). Apart from three studieson clinical remission, all included studies used radiographic progression as the primary outcome, although with various definitions.

The value of RF as a prognostic marker in patients with EA was reportedly heterogeneous and extremely dependent on the prevalence of radiographic progression in the cohorts. Depending on the studies, positive predictive values (PPVs) of RF for radiographic progression ranged from 20% to 92%, without a clear trend towards one or the other of these extreme values. Negative predictive values (NPVs) were better, with half of the studies reporting a NPV of RF for radiographic progression between 60% and 80%, and the other half reporting even higher NPVs (80–100%). PPVs of ACPAs for radiographic progression in patients with EA were also heterogeneous, with approximately half of the studies reporting low PPVs with values between 20% and 40%, and the other half reporting high PPVs with values over 80%. On the other hand, NPVs of ACPAs for radiographic progression were high, around 80% in the majority of the included studies.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disorder that manifests as a symmetric polyarthritis of small and large joints that may lead to joint and periarticular structural damage and the consequences of systemic inflammation. This overview of early RA examines the unmet needs and challenges in RA, how to best diagnose RA, and pitfalls in early diagnosis and treatment. The rules for referral to a rheumatologist are reviewed. Primary care physicians are at the front line of early diagnosis and need to start disease-modifying therapy as soon as a diagnosis of RA is established.

### 2019 update of the American College of Rheumatology recommended rheumatoid arthritis disease activity measures [^6204af36]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide updated American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity measurements to facilitate a treat-to-target approach in routine clinical care.

Methods

A working group conducted a systematic literature review from the time of the prior ACR recommendations literature search. Properties of disease activity measures were abstracted, and study quality was assessed using the Consensus-Based Standards for the selection of Health Measurement Instruments 4-point scoring method, allowing for overall level of evidence assessment. Measures that fulfilled a minimum standard were identified, and through a modified Delphi process preferred measures were selected for regular use in most clinic settings.

Results

The search identified 5,199 articles, of which 110 were included in the review. This search identified 46 RA disease activity measures that contained patient, provider, laboratory, and/or imaging data. Descriptions of the measures, properties, study quality, level of evidence, and feasibility were abstracted and scored. Following a modified Delphi process, 11 measures fulfilled a minimum standard for regular use in most clinic settings, and 5 measures were recommended: the Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints with Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate or C-Reactive Protein Level, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3, and Patient Activity Scale-II.

Conclusion

We have updated prior ACR recommendations for preferred RA disease activity measures, identifying 11 measures that met a minimum standard for regular use and 5 measures that were preferred for regular use in most clinic settings.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^df3f5693]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

ACPAs isotype distribution does not expand during disease progression from the undifferentiated arthritis to RA and is relatively stable over time. In RA, the baseline ACPAs isotype profile was a significant predictor of disease severity, with more isotypes indicating a higher risk of radiographic damage. Among ACPAs, anti-CCP has a superior diagnostic and prognostic value. Table 1 summarizes the diagnostic value of various ACPA assays. Anti-CCP and IgA-RF predict the development of RA, with anti-CCP antibody having the highest predictive value. RF (IgM, IgA isotypes) and anti-CCP associated with more severe disease indicated by more erosions and severe functional impairment. The presence of anti-MCV also predicted joint damage, and the strength of this prediction was at least as strong as for anti-CCP. Higher anti-MCV levels add prognostic information compared to their mere presence or absence.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovium, that can lead to progressive joint destruction and in many cases results in severe disability and poor quality of life. With the availability of more sophisticated and effective therapies and with increasing evidence that the first few months of disease represent an unique therapeutic opportunity and that such early therapeutic intervention is crucial in preventing irreversible joint damage, it is widely accepted that early and accurate diagnosis of RA is critical in disease management. Within the last three years a growing number of publications have reported that the second generation anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) test may become the marker of choice for diagnosing early RA as it appears to be highly specific for the disease with a sensitivity comparable to the widely used but less specific rheumatoid factor test. Additionally, anti-CCP2 positivity can predict future development of RA in both asymptomatic individuals and in patients with undifferentiated arthritis. Furthermore, antibody levels at presentation can correlate with progression to erosive disease.

### Rheumatoid factor isotypes in rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis and prognosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cc39259f]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study search strategy and selection

The Medline database was accessed from PubMed and systematically searched for articles published in English. The search strategy was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendationsto increase standardisation and quality in reporting. We followed the search strategy and article selection process illustrated in the flow charts in online supplemental figures 1 and 2, using the search terms: "rheumatoid factor isotypes", "diagnosis", "prognosis" and "rheumatoid arthritis". The search strings used for each association are detailed in the respective flowchart. Only peer-reviewed articles in English accepted for publication were included in this search. The last search was run on 31 July 2022. From the initial search, we excluded papers not appropriate for the study design as ascertained by title and abstract. Reviews and case reports were also excluded. FM and NB have independently assessed the quality of the studies and the risk of biases, screened the full text reports and decided whether these met the inclusion criteria while resolving any disagreement through discussions. Neither of the authors were blind to the journal titles or to the study authors or institutions.

Finally, 36 studies providing data on RF isotypes were considered eligible for inclusion in the data analysis. All papers were assessed for methodological quality and statistical data on diagnostic accuracy of the tests.

Data extraction

Data retrieved from the articles included criteria for patient recruitment; the number of patients and healthy subjects enrolled; demographic and clinical data on the population investigated; the RF isotypes studied; specification of the analytical method used to detect RF isotypes (either in-house or commercial and, in this latter case, subdivided by the manufacturer); the cut-off used; sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the number of true positive, false negative, true negative and false positive results. Missing data were calculated from the data available. Regarding the role of isotopes in defining prognosis, disease activity, radiographic progression and response to treatment were chosen. Data were reported in online supplemental tables 5–7 and were only described, to avoid risk of biases in a statistical analysis. Any missing or unclear information was not considered. Studies performed on the same population for comparison of two or more analytical methods were maintained. Therefore, the number of studies exceeds the number of selected articles.

### Rheumatologic tests: a primer for family physicians… [^7a665b23]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

This article gives a framework for laboratory testing in patients with a suspected connective tissue disease. Common diseases are presented with typical symptoms, and an overview of appropriate testing is provided. 3 The likelihood of SLE is low in patients with negative ANA titers who do not have the full constellation of symptoms. In addition to ANA testing, a complete metabolic panel can be ordered to evaluate renal and hepatic function; a complete blood count with differential can help screen for lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; and urinalysis with microscopy can assess for hematuria, pyuria, and proteinuria. 5 The positive likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of SLE is 2. 2, and the negative likelihood ratio is 0.

1. 5 Because indirect immunofluorescence is labor intensive, many commercial laboratories are moving to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which is less expensive but less accurate.

22 However, a positive RF titer does not provide a definitive diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The sensitivity and specificity are 69% and 85%, respectively; the LR+ is 4. 86, and the LR– is 0.
38. 23 Thus, RF should not be used indiscriminately as a screening test in patients with joint pain 24 because many conditions can stimulate β cells to produce antibodies, including viral infections, endocarditis, lymphoma, and cryoglobulinemia.
25. ANTICYCLIC CITRULLINATED PEPTIDE ANTIBODIES Because of the low sensitivity and specificity of RF for rheumatoid arthritis, other tests have been developed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay should be considered to detect anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies in patients with a moderate clinical pretest probability of rheumatoid arthritis. Its pooled sensitivity and specificity are 67% and 95%, respectively; the LR+ is 12. 46, and the LR– is 0.
36. 26.

ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES Although a histologic biopsy showing vasculitis is the preferred diagnostic test for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing has clinical utility as a diagnostic marker. ANCAs are antibodies directed against granules in the neutrophil cytoplasm.

### Diagnostic accuracy of combined tests of anti cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor for rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis [^2076d695]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic properties of combined tests of anti cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We performed an extensive research between January 2000 and January 2013 of the published literature. A random-effects model was used to summarise data from 24 studies that conformed to our inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by threshold effect analysis and meta-regression.

Results

The summary estimates for anti-CCP antibody and RF positivity (both serum markers had to be positive) in the diagnosis of RA were: sensitivity 57% (95% confidence interval (CI), 55% to 59%), specificity 96% (CI, 96% to 97%), positive likelihood ratio (LR) 13.84 (CI, 10.56 to 18.12), negative LR 0.46 (CI, 0.40 to 0.52), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 33.02 (CI, 23.89 to 45.64). The pooled data for anti-CCP antibody or RF positivity (one serum marker had to be positive) were: sensitivity 78% (CI, 76% to 80%), specificity 82% (CI, 81% to 84%), positive LR 4.24 (CI, 3.61 to 4.97), negative LR 0.27 (CI, 0.22 to 0.34), DOR 16.95 (CI, 12.96 to 22.18).

Conclusions

Both anti-CCP antibody and RF positivity are useful for ruling in the diagnosis of RA, and positivity combined improves the probability of true positivity in the diagnosis. Anti-CCP antibody or RF positivity shows low specificity and positive LR, and should be integrated with other examinations to make a final diagnosis.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: the continuum of disease and strategies for prediction, early intervention, and prevention [^d8a0e4ed]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to include a pre-RA stage that can be defined as the presence of familial or genetic risk factors, biomarker abnormalities (eg, anticitrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA]), symptoms, and even abnormal imaging findings prior to the development of the onset of clinical RA with inflammatory arthritis that is apparent on physical examination. Indeed, there are multiple completed or ongoing retrospective case-control as well as prospective observational studies to identify the key biologic drivers of disease. Further, building on the predictive ability of combinations of biomarkers, symptoms, and imaging for future RA, there are multiple clinical trials completed, underway, or in development to identify approaches that may prevent, delay, or ameliorate future clinical RA in at-risk individuals. Importantly, however, although an effective preventive intervention has not yet been identified, at-risk individuals are being increasingly identified in clinical care; this presents a challenge of how to manage these individuals in clinical practice. This review will discuss the current understanding of the biology and natural history of RA development, nomenclature, and current models for prediction of future RA, as well as evaluate the current and ongoing clinical prevention trials with the overall goal to provide insights into the challenges and opportunities in the field of RA prevention. Moreover, this review will provide up-to-date options for clinical management of individuals at risk for RA.

### Changes in proliferation kinetics of T cells: a new predictive cellular biomarkers for early rheumatoid arthritis? [^78957168]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Firm diagnosis of RA obtained prior to the onset of severe disability and irreversible morphological damage to cartilage and bone is of the utmost importance. From onwards 1987 the limitations of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for early RA diagnosis resulted in the establishment of new classification criteria by European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology experts in 2010 with the aim of identifying patients with inflammatory arthritis who are at high risk of developing persistent and erosive RA. These criteria are still classification rather than diagnostic criteria, and therefore diagnostic methods which could be termed as biomarkers for such an early distinction are still missing.

Among the available laboratory markers for RA are the recommendations of the 2010 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology which include, in addition to RF, anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), mainly represented as anti-CCP antibodies. Many results have been obtained which confirm that anti-CCP antibodies have higher specificity and sensitivity than RF in the diagnosis of RA. On the other hand, a number of reports have shown great disproportion in the sensitivity and specificity calculations of serological markers in terms of providing an accurate prognosis of early RA. In addition, the results in diagnosis and prediction of early RA have been sharply contradictory and differed from those for established RA. According to the published results the sensitivity of anti-CCP antibodies in early RA ranges from 39 to 61%, while the specificity ranges from 93 to 98%. Similarly the RF marker showed a sensitivity of 31 to 54% with a specificity from 86 to 93%. The great disparity between the results for sensitivity and specificity is mainly due to the discrepancies in methodology for the kits that are commercially available and differences in set cut-off values and test generation. Despite the higher specificity of the anti-CCP test compared to RF in the diagnosis of early RA, RF still seems to be useful in diagnosis. Ursum et al. showed that RF may be present in patients with RA, the serological negative of anti-CCP antibodies. However, RF and anti-CCP antibodies are detected even in subjects with non-rheumatic disease. One of the severe limitations of anti-CCP antibodies was demonstrated by Ioan-Facsinay et al. who showed that anti-CCP antibodies as measured by the most frequently performed test using the ELISA second generation set of the test and specific anti-CCP antibodies are largely cross-reactive with many epitopes, which outweighs their heterogeneity. These results hardly make either marker acceptable as an early RA predictor.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^ced9eeb4]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our results, as well as evidence from previously published literature, clearly supports the need for early referral (ideally within 3 months of symptom onset) of patients with EA to a rheumatologist, in order to reduce the likelihood of joint damage and to improve clinical outcomes. Our current SLR identified two studies of questionnaires that can be used by GPs to help detecting inflammatory arthritis. Unfortunately, these questionnaires were tested with only small samples and were not confirmed in independent validation cohorts. Validated tools that help GPs diagnose and refer EA are lacking.

According to our results, RA is the most frequent diagnosis that patients with EA will achieve. For this reason, an important limitation to the extrapolation of our results is that most of the literature data concerned patients with early RA and not patients with early undifferentiated arthritis. Another limitation is the heterogeneity of the outcomes definition according to the studies. For the studies on diagnosis, due to the lack of a clear gold standard for RA diagnosis, definition and prevalence of the outcome 'RA diagnosis' varied between the studies. The studies on prognosis used various definition for the outcome 'radiographic progression'.

RF and ACPAs are the most frequently evaluated laboratory tests. In the literature, the sensitivity of these autoantibodies for an RA diagnosis in patients with EA is variable but moderately high on average (between 40% and 80%). An explanation for this variability is the difference in patient populations (in particular with regard to disease duration) across the studies. Specificity is better, notably for ACPAs with values frequently over 80%. These diagnostic values are slightly lower than those typically reported and this could be explained by the short disease duration of patients with EA. Prognostic values of RF and ACPAs in terms of predicting radiographic progression were very dependent on the prevalence of radiographic progression in the studies but NPVs were in general higher for ACPAs (around 80%) than for RF. PPVs were lower for both autoantibodies, probably because radiographic progression was infrequent. Our results allow us to conclude that both autoantibodies are useful tests in patients with EA, but that ACPAs have a higher diagnostic and prognostic value than RF in patients with EA.

### 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^16cee2c5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a new evidence-based, pharmacologic treatment guideline for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We conducted systematic reviews to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of various treatment options. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the quality of evidence. We employed a group consensus process to grade the strength of recommendations (either strong or conditional). A strong recommendation indicates that clinicians are certain that the benefits of an intervention far outweigh the harms (or vice versa). A conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty over the balance of benefits and harms and/or more significant variability in patient values and preferences.

Results

The guideline covers the use of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, tofacitinib, and glucocorticoids in early (< 6 months) and established (≥ 6 months) RA. In addition, it provides recommendations on using a treat-to-target approach, tapering and discontinuing medications, and the use of biologic agents and DMARDs in patients with hepatitis, congestive heart failure, malignancy, and serious infections. The guideline addresses the use of vaccines in patients starting/receiving DMARDs or biologic agents, screening for tuberculosis in patients starting/receiving biologic agents or tofacitinib, and laboratory monitoring for traditional DMARDs. The guideline includes 74 recommendations: 23% are strong and 77% are conditional.

Conclusion

This RA guideline should serve as a tool for clinicians and patients (our two target audiences) for pharmacologic treatment decisions in commonly encountered clinical situations. These recommendations are not prescriptive, and the treatment decisions should be made by physicians and patients through a shared decision-making process taking into account patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

### Towards better personalized care in rheumatoid arthritis [^c8b8ce00]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

An ideal solution to the challenge of choice of the most effective and safe pharmacological treatment for any individual would be to have access to 'precision' medicine tools. The term 'precision' implies that such tools would have a very high accuracy. At present, however, there are no readily available biomarkers that inform individual management decisions in routine clinical care with absolute reliability, although researchers are making progress in the quest for precision medicine approaches. Recent advances in understanding of RA subtypes based on synovial histomorphology and molecular profiling may pave the way to more accurately predict response to treatments with different mechanisms of action in the future. While more prospective research in this field is needed, it is anticipated that there will be further advances in biomarker research in coming years. It is likely that immunological data can be combined with other clinically relevant information using artificial intelligence methods to bring us a step closer to true precision medicine. Once validated, such advances should be embraced in clinical practice.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^3663e763]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Search strategy

The databases of PubMed and Embase were searched for papers in English until December 2018 for search 1 and December 2019 for search 2. Additionally, the conference abstracts of EULAR and ACR were screened, from 2017 to 2018 for search 1 and from 2017 until 2019 for search 2. Advice regarding the setup of the search strategy was provided by two experienced librarians of Utrecht University (FPW and PHW).

The first search focused on the diagnosis of RA and relevant differential diagnoses. In addition to terms for RA and terms related to diagnostic studies, terms for misdiagnosis and common alternative and coexisting mimicking diseases were included (online supplemental file for search details). During the Task Force meeting, it was agreed to perform a limited search on recent literature on this topic as not much research on (mis-)diagnosis relevant to our project was expected to be present and to have a more focused approach given the many clinical questions on D2T RA that were defined by the Task Force. Therefore, a search limit was set to the last ten years and reference screening was not performed.

The second search focused on the assessment of inflammatory activity. In addition to terms for RA and terms related to diagnostic studies, terms for D2T RA and comorbidities that might influence assessment of inflammatory activity, general terms for inflammation and specific tests to assess inflammatory activity were included (search details in online supplemental file). A search limit was set to the last ten years. In addition, the reference lists of selected papers were manually screened. References published in the year 2000 and later were eligible for inclusion. This cut-off was chosen because of the introduction of bDMARDs around this time and, herewith, the beginning of a new diagnostic and therapeutic landscape regarding acceptable disease activity in the field of RA.

### Flowsheets that include MDHAQ physical function, pain, global, and RAPID3 scores, laboratory tests, and medications to monitor patients with all rheumatic diseases: an electronic database for an electronic medical record [^b5df66a9]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Electronic medical records (EMR) are used increasingly in contemporary medical care. Function, pain, global status, and RAPID3 scores remain important considerations in all rheumatic diseases. Inclusion of these scores in a flowsheet that also includes laboratory tests and medications could transform the EMR into a true medical database. Flowsheets are presented for patients with rheumatologic diagnoses other than rheumatoid arthritis to illustrate the value of the multidimensional health assessment questionnaire and RAPID3 scores in an electronic database for an EMR.

### Multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies test results [^8d9b88a0]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

In a subsequent study, we show the impact of using specificity-based thresholds on RA classification. In that study, we also show that RA classification can be improved by taking into account the nature of the antibody (RF vs ACPA), the antibody level and single or double positivity (manuscript in preparation).

In conclusion, defining thresholds for antibody levels and assigning test result-specific LRs helps to harmonise interpretation of RF and ACPA immunoassays in routine clinical practice. The LR is dependent on the antibody level, and the antibody type (higher LR for ACPA than for RF). Applying the same criteria on the same cohort of patients and controls is a powerful tool to align interpretation across assays from different companies. It is the shared societal responsibility of laboratory professionals, in vitro diagnostics and clinicians to harmonise interpretation of laboratory test results such that they can be reliably applied in routine diagnostic protocols.

### The changing face of rheumatoid arthritis: sustained remission for all? [^2c1796e8]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2010). Medium credibility.

Earlier diagnosis and treatment, plus biological therapies, have transformed the outlook for many patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In the future, new biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response will further improve outcomes. Additionally, preclinical diagnosis and tolerogenic therapies could provide sustained remission for some individuals, although ethical and societal challenges must also be addressed before rheumatoid arthritis becomes 'yesterday's disease'.

### Therapeutic implications of autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis [^2834c10b]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic associations of autoantibodies for RA

RF and ACPA have been associated with the diagnosis of RA. RF has been associated with a diagnosis of RA when used in patients with early undifferentiated arthritis in multiple studies. According to one review of the topic, the positive likelihood ratios of RF for a diagnosis of RA ranged from 1.1 to 13.5. The presence of ACPA has likewise been shown to predict later development of RA in many studies of early arthritis. Both antibodies have been shown to predict RA even when detected in healthy individuals. The clear diagnostic value of these tests is emphasised in the prominent position of serology in management recommendations for early arthritis, as well as in current classification criteria for RA. Another older review of the diagnostic properties of RF and ACPA suggested higher specificity for ACPA; however, publication bias for the then limited number of ACPA studies could not be ruled out. RF may to a greater extent than ACPA be present in healthy, elderly persons or in patients with other autoimmune or infectious diseases. However, it has been suggested that raising the standard cut-point of positivity for RF to 50 U/mL increases the specificity of RF for a diagnosis of RA to at least match the one for ACPA.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^aa5052f9]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Research questions

The first step included the formulation of five key research questions to be addressed in the SLR. The research questions were proposed by the convenor (BC) and the methodologist (RL), then amended and approved by the expert committee. These research questions encompassed the recognition (1) and referral (2) of patients with EA, the diagnosis of EA (3), its prognosis (4) and its classification (5) (see online supplementary material S1). The research questions were framed, defined and structured according to EULAR standardised operating proceduresusing the 'Patients, Intervention, Comparator or Control, Outcome, Type of study (PICOT) format' (see online supplementary material S2).

Literature search

Literature available until October 2015 was reviewed by two supervised research fellows (CD and CH). This SLR was considered a follow-up of several previous EULAR SLRs: the 2005 SLR performed for the EULAR recommendations for management of EAas well as two other SLRs performed by other EULAR task forces.

The first part of the SLR aimed to assess the recognition of arthritis and referral to a medical specialist. It was an update of a previous SLR performed until 2010.

The second part of the SLR was conducted to determine the value of laboratory and imaging tests in the diagnosis and the prognosis of EA, to study the differential diagnosis in patients with EA and to evaluate the performance of EA classification criteria in patients with a diagnosis of EA. Except for the imaging tests, this SLR was an update of the previous SLR performed until 2005 for the 2007 EULAR recommendations for EA management. For imaging tests, we used 2011 as a start date because of the previous SLR performed until 2011.

The search was performed by a skilled librarian form the Columbia University, New York, USA and covered the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Central, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and National Health Service (NHS) and those for the 2014 and 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR annual meetings. In addition, the reference lists of articles were manually searched to identify additional articles. Specific medical subject headings and additional keywords were used to identify all relevant studies (see online supplementary material S3).

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^74f39646]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Once results are available from formal qualitative studies of the emergence of symptoms in people at risk of RA and in those with a new onset of disease, these results can be used to inform the development of a "symptom questionnaire" to assess the frequency of symptoms and their evolution in individuals at risk of RA. Through this approach, refinement of algorithms for use in secondary care to predict RA development in patients with unclassified arthritis and patients with inflammatory joint symptoms and RA-related autoantibodies may be achieved. Importantly, tools also need to be developed for use in primary care to direct management pathways, including determining which patients with joint-related symptoms should be investigated (e.g. with autoantibody testing or imaging) and who should be referred to a rheumatologist. The patient's history is readily available and inexpensive. Maximizing value from this history and assessing the predictive utility of its components in the earliest phases of RA can only be achieved once these components are fully understood.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^6356592c]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints and is associated with autoantibodies that target various molecules including modified self-epitopes. The identification of novel autoantibodies has improved diagnostic accuracy, and newly developed classification criteria facilitate the recognition and study of the disease early in its course. New clinical assessment tools are able to better characterize disease activity states, which are correlated with progression of damage and disability, and permit improved follow-up. In addition, better understanding of the pathogenesis of RA through recognition of key cells and cytokines has led to the development of targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Altogether, the improved understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved, rational use of established drugs and development of new drugs and reliable assessment tools have drastically altered the lives of individuals with RA over the past 2 decades. Current strategies strive for early referral, early diagnosis and early start of effective therapy aimed at remission or, at the least, low disease activity, with rapid adaptation of treatment if this target is not reached. This treat-to-target approach prevents progression of joint damage and optimizes physical functioning, work and social participation. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of RA.

### Poor prognostic factors and unmet needs in rheumatoid arthritis [^adfa9ee0]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While hitherto only few prognostic biomarkers that predict development of RA or response to therapy have been found, recent insights suggest that the best predictors for progression from pre-clinical to clinically overt RA or of therapeutic response are the old markers: rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein. However, their prognostic effects are even surpassed by the early clinical response, which predicts good outcomes independent of the type of treatment. Nevertheless, there exist some promising approaches using novel biomarker panels or cellular characteristics, but these must be appropriately validated before a general use can be recommended. Finding more reliable and better predictive prognostic markers than the currently available ones remains an unmet need and challenge. This will likely be resolved once we learn more about the events leading to RA so that causative therapies can be implemented with the respective information at hand.

### Laboratory and imaging studies used by French rheumatologists to determine the cause of recent onset polyarthritis without extra-articular manifestations [^c04a1721]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of recent onset polyarthritis can be difficult to identify.

Objective

To determine which laboratory and imaging studies French rheumatologists recommend, not taking cost into account, for the diagnosis of recent onset polyarthritis without extra-articular manifestations.

Methods

From the list of the French Society for Rheumatology, a random sample of 210 rheumatologists was selected, who were asked to complete a questionnaire on the laboratory and imaging studies they would recommend in two fictional cases of recent onset polyarthritis (possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-case 1 and probable RA-case 2).

Results

In case 1, the following were recommended by over 75% of respondents: hand radiographs, rheumatoid factors (RFs), and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (92%, 98%, and 98%, respectively). 50–74% of respondents recommended radiographs of the feet, knees, and chest (50%, 57%, and 66%, respectively); blood cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum assays of C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (65%, 74%, 67%, and 62%, respectively). 25–49% recommended determination of creatinine and proteinuria, HLA-B27, antikeratin antibody, radiographs of the pelvis, and synovial fluid analysis. Several investigations were recommended less often in case 2 than in case 1. Nevertheless, some laboratory and imaging studies (radiographs of hand, feet, knees, chest x rays, blood cell counts, ANA, RF, antikeratin antibody, CRP, ESR, creatinine, AST and ALT, proteinuria, and joint aspiration) were recommended by more than 25% of respondents in both cases.

Conclusion

Wide variations were found among rheumatologists, indicating a need for standardisation. Some laboratory and imaging studies are recommended by at least 25% of respondents in recent onset polyarthritis with or without clues suggesting RA. In contrast, many tests were considered useful by fewer than 25% of the respondents in both cases.

### What are the dominant cytokines in early rheumatoid arthritis? [^aaa28d35]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The preponderance of ACPA and/or rheumatoid factor seropositive patients with rheumatoid arthritis amongst populations studied in most of the clinical trials alluded to here is notable. Where it is available, accumulating data identifies seronegative rheumatoid arthritis as subject to relatively unfavourable treatment responses, irrespective of the targeted cytokine. Perhaps this is unsurprising given the aetiological distinction of this subgroup, but it highlights persistent unmet needs: not only in pathophysiological understanding, but also in our ability to map therapeutic response to measurable markers of the heterogeneous disease process at an individual patient level. Pretreatment levels of circulating cytokines themselves have so far proved to be of little value for this purpose, and the ability to measure their effects at a cellular level and/or within synovial tissue holds promise for stratified treatment approaches.

### Early rheumatoid arthritis [^ba78fad9]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Longitudinal and observational studies have provided important information on the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinical outcomes, and prognostic markers. In terms of clinical effectiveness of drugs used in RA, the results of such projects can be used to complement those of randomized studies. If well designed and conducted, inception cohorts are the most robust types of observational studies, reflect the most complete spectrum of disease, and provide the most reliable prognostic markers for the management of this chronic condition.

### A core set of risk factors in individuals at risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR points to consider for conducting clinical trials and observational studies in individuals at risk of rheumatoid arthritis [^8ac3cd20]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Risk factors for arthritis development in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are specific to the at-risk population.
Serum anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) confer risk of RA in both asymptomatic and symptomatic at-risk populations.
Serum ACPA, clinical features and subclinical inflammation on imaging should be considered as 'core risk factors' in individuals at risk of RA who have symptoms without clinical arthritis.

### ACR / EULAR 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria [^0aa3199b]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of RA over the past two decades, particularly the identification of cytokines that promote synovial inflammation (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6), have led to treatment courses that affect the disease process itself, beyond alleviation of symptoms. In turn, emphasis has shifted to intervention early enough in the disease course to prevent the joint destruction that follows inflammation. Accordingly, in 2010 the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) put forward revised classification criteria emphasizing RA characteristics that emerge early in the disease course, including ACPAs, a biomarker that predicts aggressive disease. These were in contrast with the 1987 ARA criteria, which distinguished established RA patients from those with other forms of arthritis, and identified patients with later disease. The categories of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria are grouped into four classifications, with point scores for each: joint symptoms; serology (including RF and/or ACPA); symptom duration, whether < 6 weeks or > 6 weeks; and acute-phase reactants (CRP and/or ESR). The criteria were developed in a three-phase process, beginning with an analysis of patient cohorts to determine what disease characteristics had persuaded clinicians to initiate MTX therapy, followed by consensus-based decisions and the creation of a scoring system that would predict which patients would go on to develop persistent and/or erosive disease.

### A clinical approach to autoantibody testing in systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorders [^8ee62fe9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders constitute one of the most common clinical presentations to clinical care givers. Within this category of illnesses, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are included in the differential diagnosis. A hallmark of SARD is the production of autoantibodies, which are routinely requested as a guide to diagnosis and clinical decision making. The field of serological tests, including the detection of autoantibodies, is complex and often leads to confusion and misunderstanding. When used appropriately, autoantibodies can be a valuable adjunct to the diagnosis, and occasionally therapy and prognosis, of SARD. The role of autoantibody testing and a 'practical' approach to using these tests is the focus of this paper.

### Laboratory and clinical performance of the ADVIA centaur anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis [^41651216]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context —

Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are important serologic markers for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Several kinds of test reagents for automated immunoassay systems have been developed and used in recent years.

Objective —

To evaluate the analytic and diagnostic performance of the new ADVIA Centaur anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) compared with the Elecsys assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).

Design —

A total of 576 serum samples were collected from subjects, including 156 patients (27%) with rheumatoid arthritis. Precision performance and analytical measurement range for the ADVIA assay were evaluated. Diagnostic performance of the 2 assays was compared based on sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results —

The ADVIA assay showed a within-laboratory imprecision of 3.4% coefficient of variation for levels of 3.36 and 24.99 U/mL. This assay was demonstrated to be linear from 0.4 to 180.0 U/mL. With default cutoff values, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis were 71.2% and 97.9%, respectively, for the ADVIA assay and 73.1% and 96.9%, respectively, for the Elecsys assay. With the best cutoff values from the analyses of the receiver operating characteristic curve, the sensitivity of the 2 assays was the same at 75.6%. However, the specificity of the ADVIA assay was 96.4%, whereas that of the Elecsys assay was 94.3%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value for the ADVIA assay was 0.867, which was not significantly different from that of the Elecsys assay (0.865).

Conclusions —

The ADVIA Centaur anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay showed good analytic and diagnostic performance in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.

### The role of anti-cyclic cytrullinate antibodies testing in rheumatoid arthritis [^44e8a5ac]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease, which leads to joint destruction and deformity and is often accompanied by systemic complications. It is generally considered an autoimmune disease characterized by several autoantibodies. The impressive advances made in understanding the biological mechanisms of RA have led to more focused, directed therapies that have joined, and in many cases overcome, more traditional treatments. Along the last decade, the so-called biological anti-TNF-alpha agents have been shown to reduce disease activity, to slow disease progression and to improve patients' quality of life. The clear evidence that an early therapeutic intervention improves the overall outcome of the disease supports the importance of an early diagnosis. In the last years, several studies showed that anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) represent a sensitive and specific serologic marker for RA. Moreover, a large body of evidence has shown that anti-CCP may also serve as an early diagnostic and prognostic marker in RA. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding anti-CCP focusing in particular on their clinical specificity and prognostic value in RA.

### Utility of testing for third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in individuals who present with new musculoskeletal symptoms but have a negative second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) antibody test [^a9666787]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, no quantitative results were available for anti-CCP2 antibody, which limits the ability to analyse the value of anti-CCP2 antibody levels on disease progression. Therefore, a definitive answer regarding the best screening strategy in individuals 'at risk' of RA (ie, anti-CCP2 or anti-CCP3 antibody testing) will require a large head-to-head study, with previous attempts at such studies proving inconclusive in patients with RA. This evaluation would enable a direct comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of both tests in this specific 'at-risk' population, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their respective performances. Furthermore, conducting such studies would allow for the assessment and determination of the optimal screening strategy for identifying at-risk individuals.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^867ba70e]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria turned out to be more sensitive than the 1987 revised ACR criteria and to facilitate early identification of patients with RA immediately after the onset of symptoms, that is, synovitis in at least one small or two large joints. This allows not only the inclusion of patients with early arthritis in clinical studies but also a more timely start of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), depending on the healthcare setting. The higher sensitivity has been demonstrated in several studies, which, however, also revealed decreased specificity. The lower specificity partially relates to RF and ACPA positivity, as was documented in a study in which the criteria were applied to a cohort of patients with very early inflammatory arthritis. Among misclassified patients (non-RA with a score ≥ 6), 20.5% were RF and/or ACPA positive; of note, the majority of these patients were RF positive, whereas ACPA was less frequently detected. Furthermore, dual RF/ACPA positivity was largely confined to patients with RA. Hence, at the seventh International Congress on Controversies in Rheumatology and Autoimmunity, a discussion was initiated to improve the specificity of the criteria attributed to the ACPA-based and RF-based serological signatures by changing the weight factors of the serological grades.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^bf78e0a8]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

RA has a substantial impact on both patients and healthcare systems. Our objective is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the condition's diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists formulated contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations concerning both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were documented, leading to research recommendations.

Results

A fundamental concept governing treatment of RA is minimization of cumulative inflammation, referred to as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core principles of management were identified: (i) detect and refer patients early, even if the diagnosis is uncertain: patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis and rheumatology departments should provide rapid access to a diagnostic and prognostic service; (ii) treat RA immediately: optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires that effective treatment be started early-ideally within 3 months of symptom onset; (iii) tight control of inflammation in RA improves outcome: frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low-disease activity/remission at an agreed target; (iv) consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment to each patient: differing patient, disease and drug characteristics require long-term monitoring of risks and benefits with adaptations of treatments to suit individual circumstances.

Conclusion

These principles focus on effective control of the inflammatory process in RA, but optimal uptake may require changes in service provision to accommodate appropriate care pathways.

### Identification of novel urinary biomarkers for assessing disease activity and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis [^798e1d80]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that progressively destroys cartilage and bone. The assessment of the status of RA is a central aspect of patient care. The reduction of RA activity is the major target of therapeutic interventions. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the most commonly used blood markers to evaluate disease activity of RA. However, ESR stays elevated for some time after inflammation is reduced by treatments, and it can be influenced by anemia and age. CRP is non-specifically influenced by infection. Importantly, ESR and CRP may remain normal in more than a third of RA patients at presentation irrespective of disease activity. The disease activity score 28 (DAS28), which is based on counts of tender and swollen joints and ESR (or CRP) measurements, has been widely used for RA assessment. However, it requires specific expertise. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), a representative diagnostic marker of RA, can help predict radiographic progression. However, ACPA does not usually correlate with disease activity of RA. In these instances, there remains an unmet need for alternative biomarkers that can complement conventional serum measures to precisely monitor disease activity of RA.

### Multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies test results [^48b4d757]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) are important biomarkers for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there is poor harmonisation of RF and ACPA assays. The aim of this study was to refine RF and ACPA interpretation across commercial assays.

Materials and Methods

Six total RF isotype-non-specific assays, 3 RF IgM isotype-specific assays and 9 ACPA immunoglobulin G assays of 13 different companies were evaluated using 398 diagnostic samples from patients with RA and 1073 disease controls.

Results

Using cut-offs proposed by the manufacturer, there was a large variability in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity between assays. Thresholds of antibody levels were determined based on predefined specificities and used to define test result intervals. Test result interval-specific likelihood ratios (LRs) were concordant across the different RF and ACPA assays. For all assays, the LR for RA increased with increasing antibody level. Higher LRs were found for ACPA than for RF. ACPA levels associated with LRs > 80 were found in a substantial fraction (> 22%) of patients with RA.

Conclusion

Defining thresholds for antibody levels and assigning test result interval-specific LRs allows alignment of clinical interpretation for all RF and ACPA assays.

### Appropriateness in anti-nuclear antibody testing: from clinical request to strategic laboratory practice [^adea4369]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

As a result of rapid changes in laboratory technology, clinical behaviour and patients' expectations, along with limited economic resources, there is a greater requirement for an appropriate use of autoantibody testing. We examine the various aspects and the most controversial points of the diagnostic procedure in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and make recommendations for the most efficient approach to autoantibody testing, based on selected publications and the relevant literature. Appropriateness is a complex task that can be achieved only by combining the efforts from the laboratory and the clinic, thereby using scientific knowledge, inter-disciplinary consultation and expert clinical investigation.

### DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR cut-offs for high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis are not interchangeable [^de5d3f48]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Since the difference between baseline DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP in this analysis is similar to other clinical trials, the new HDA definition may be applicable across various populations. However, this cut-off needs to be validated in longitudinal or registry cohorts. Additionally, it is possible that minor differences may occur in the cut-off value, depending on the laboratory and also on whether traditional CRP or hs-CRP is used. This analysis included only one study that used traditional CRP and one that used hs-CRP; therefore, we were not able to closely evaluate the potential for differences.

In summary, we recommend the use of a new HDA definition of > 4.6 when using DAS28-CRP, since this is comparable to the validated DAS28-ESR HDA cut-off of > 5.1. The new HDA definition should be used alongside the previously reported thresholds for DAS28-CRP of ≤ 2.9 for LDA and < 2.4 for remission. This will enable more accurate measurement of disease activity when the DAS28-CRP is used. It is essential that clinicians, clinical triallists, payers and regulatory agencies clearly specify which type of DAS28 score is being used and avoid using them interchangeably.

### The need to better classify and diagnose early and very early rheumatoid arthritis [^f2878367]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and very early RA are major targets of research and clinical practice. Remission has become a realistic goal in the management of RA, particularly in early disease. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) RA classification criteria, the EULAR treatment recommendations for RA, and the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis focus on early disease and translate the knowledge related to early RA into classification and management. Nevertheless, there is a need for further improvement and progress. Results from 6 recent studies are summarized, evaluating the performance of the 2010 ACR/EULAR RA classification criteria. The data show a significant risk of misclassification, and highlight that overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis may become important issues if the criteria recommend synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Therefore, some considerations are presented on how the current problems and limitations could be overcome in clinical practice and future research. A consensus is needed to better define the early phase of RA and differentiate from other early arthritis. The possible effect of misclassification on spontaneous and drug-induced remission of early and very early RA awaits further elucidation. Such research will eventually lead to more reliable diagnostic and classification criteria for new-onset RA.

### Therapeutic implications of autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis [^30f7a5c0]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex chronic disease. Historically, RA has been labelled as seropositive or seronegative, according to the presence or absence of detectable rheumatoid factor (RF). RF is an antibody directed against the Fc portion of human IgG. It is well characterised, although its exact origin still remains unclear. Typically, RF is of IgM isotype, but IgG and IgA may also occur. In the past, RF levels were determined by classical agglutination reactions; however, sensitivities and specificities depended on the type of test (eg, latex fixation test, or Waaler-Rose test using sheep erythrocytes). Recently, RF levels are determined by nephelometry.

Other antibodies with specificities for RA include antiperinuclear factor and antikeratin antibodies which were known for a long time, but have never reached widespread use because of difficulties in their detection. Recently, a large portion of patients with RA were shown to produce antibodies recognising certain peptides containing citrullinated arginine residues. The autoantibodies that were detectable in this way were, therefore, summarised as anti citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPA) and this is their current name. When cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) were used instead of linear citrulline as antigens in test systems, diagnostic test properties further improved and these test were then commercialised as anti-CCP tests. Suddenly, patients could also be classified as seropositive or seronegative for RFs, as well as for ACPA. Today, second and third generation of anti-CCP assays are available and have expanded the number of antigens to further improve sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests that these two groups of autoantibodies might not be the only ones present in RA. Anticarbamylated protein antibodies are present particularly in patients with RA in a significant amount and are prognostically seem to be similar to ACPAs. Although these do coincide with both ACPA and RF to a large extent, there is a fraction of about 10% of ACPA-negative RA patients who test positive, thus closing the seronegative gap of RA a bit more. Whether this has implications for diagnosis or subsequent treatment decisions remains to be seen.

### Using ultrasonography to facilitate best practice in diagnosis and management of RA [^56bc2f4d]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The key to successful management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is early objective quantification of inflammation and ongoing precise, tailored therapy to ensure long term suppression of inflammatory disease activity. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSKUS) has emerged as a tool with the potential to enhance disease assessment and management in this area. This includes applications in patients with undifferentiated arthropathy attending an early inflammatory arthritis clinic, in which the diagnosis of inflammatory disease may be confirmed or refuted at an early stage, and those with treated RA where accurate measurement of outcomes, such as response to therapy, structural damage and disease remission, are extremely important. This imaging modality is safe and portable, making it ideal for outpatient and inpatient settings, and can be used to assess many joints in multiple planes and to demonstrate changes in disease activity and structural damage over time. MSKUS is gaining popularity among rheumatologists, as increasing evidence supports the added value of a physician-performed ultrasonography assessment above traditional clinical, laboratory and radiographic measures, enabling greater confidence in diagnostic and management decisions. Although additional longitudinal data are required and further applications are likely to arise, MSKUS may well possess the necessary attributes to facilitate best practice in inflammatory arthritis management.

### Lyme disease: diagnosis and treatment [^05a62099]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lyme disease is an important, vector-borne infection found throughout the temperate Northern hemisphere. The disease causes rash, acute systemic illness, and in some untreated patients, inflammatory arthritis. This review examines the emergence, clinical features and management of early Lyme disease and Lyme arthritis.

Recent Findings

There has been continuing progress in characterizing the clinical manifestations, diagnostic testing and treatment of Lyme disease. Almost all patients with early Lyme disease can be cured with antibiotic treatment. In most cases, Lyme arthritis also responds to antibiotics, but some patients require additional treatment approaches.

Summary

The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical manifestations and adjunctive laboratory testing. For the rheumatologist, Lyme arthritis should be recognized by a pattern of attacks of asymmetric, oligo-arthritis, recognizable by clinical manifestations in the same way that other rheumatic diseases, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, are diagnosed.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^45f789cf]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is still a disease of unclear aetiology. It is an autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition involving many genes and women are more commonly affected than men. What exactly triggers its onset is subject to lively scientific debate, but it seems likely that once the causative abnormal immune process is established in the patient, it becomes self-perpetuating.

Rheumatoid arthritis is largely a synovial based disease with the potential for severe joint destruction, but it often has systemic manifestations. Some authors have suggested that synovitis might be secondary to a more basic disease process first occurring within medullary bone as primary inflammatory infiltrate, but this is subject to debate and not universally accepted. Intriguingly, Ostendorf and co-workers found that bone scintigraphy has demonstrated increased bone turnover in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis without correlating magnet resonance imaging (MRI) findings, while in most patients bone scintigraphic uptake correlated well with MRI changes.

Older classifications of rheumatoid arthritis were insensitive to early rheumatoid arthritis and years could pass between onset of symptoms and definite diagnosis. However studies have shown that the best outcomes are achieved by aggressive treatment within 3–6 months of onset of symptoms. The availability of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs has moved the goalposts and enables disease control and joint preservation unknown in the past but only if treatment is started early enough.

Subsequently the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis were revised. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification assesses joint involvement, blood parameters and duration of symptoms. Unlike the previous criteria, imaging is not part of this primary assessment, though radiographs of the hands might be obtained at the time of diagnosis to establish baseline findings, although, clearly, radiographs are insensitive for the early diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease. Radiographs can be used to monitor disease progression, although they are insensitive for minor change.

### Next-generation rheumatoid factor assay provides improved predictive power for the development of arthritis in patients at risk [^385a6d05]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the joints and bones and that is hallmarked by the presence of several distinct classes of autoantibodies. These are, in particular, antibodies against citrullinated proteins (anti-CCP) and antibodies against the constant region of immunoglobulin G (IgG), which are called rheumatoid factors (RF). These autoantibodies can already and often do emerge in the preclinical stage and have been found to be present in patients up to 10 years before established disease. Both anti-CCP and RF are part of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classification criteria for RAand are routinely tested on suspected disease. Whereas they share similar sensitivity, testing for anti-CCP is more specific than for RF. This is in part due to the presence of RF not limited to RA, but also because the RF response is highly heterogeneous.

Conventional RF testing is usually performed with agglutination assays or detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-RF bound to immobilised IgG molecules. Regardless, RF can occur as any given isotype, even though it is most commonly found and tested as IgM. Next, RFs are known to bind to multiple epitopes on the IgG-Fc and some of these epitopes are associated with specific disorders, a feature that is currently not used in the clinic. With this in mind, detection of RA-specific RFs may improve the specificity of these autoantibodies for predictive purposes.

We have shown previously in an explorative study that an epitope within the CH3 domain of IgG, captured by our IgG-Fc target 'T3-17', was strongly associated with RA. Preliminary results showed that detection of RF specific for this epitope in patients at risk for arthritis was linked with the presence of aCCP and showed a trend towards arthritis development. Here we validate these findings in a larger cohort of patients with seropositive arthralgia and show that detection of RA-specific RFs is feasible and improves the predictive value of RF testing.

### Laboratory changes on anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment in rheumatoid arthritis [^8443b014]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, acting through its receptors expressed on all cells of the body, is a key mediator of inflammation and immunity. However, its overproduction may also lead to pathologic changes. The latter situation occurs often in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The concept suggesting tumor necrosis factor-alpha as a potential target emerged from experiments showing its key role in inducing many cytokines and mediators of inflammation. Several clinical trials targeting this cytokine in rheumatoid arthritis patients with a novel group of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents demonstrated reduced synovial inflammation and inhibition of bone and cartilage degradation. In addition to the therapeutic value of anti-tumor necrosis factor, analysis of laboratory changes not only proved the concept but provided new data, continuously expanding our understanding of the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the pathogenesis of many diseases. These laboratory measures may also help the earlier identification of rheumatoid arthritis patients who have a less satisfactory response to this therapy.

### Autoantibody profiling as early diagnostic and prognostic tool for rheumatoid arthritis [^c58f7de3]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Early treatment prevents progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but diagnosis in early disease is impeded by lack of appropriate diagnostic criteria.

Objective

To study the value of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (anti-CCP), and anti-RA33 autoantibodies for diagnosis of RA and prediction of outcome in patients with very early arthritis.

Methods

The prospective follow up inception cohort included 200 patients with very early (< 3 months) inflammatory joint disease. Autoantibodies were measured at baseline and analysed in a tree based model which aimed at determining the added diagnostic value of testing for anti-CCP and anti-RA33 as compared with RF alone.

Results

RA was diagnosed in 102 patients, while 98 developed other inflammatory arthropathies. Receiver operator curve analysis showed an optimum cut off level for RF at 50 U/ml, above which anti-CCP and anti-RA33 had no additional diagnostic value. Remarkably, RF ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP showed similar sensitivity and high specificity for RA, but overlapped considerably. Anti-RA33 was less specific and did not correlate with RF or anti-CCP. Among patients with RA, 72% showed at least one of these three autoantibodies, compared with 15% of non-RA patients. RF ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP were predictors of erosive disease, whereas anti-RA33 was associated with mild disease.

Conclusions

Stepwise autoantibody testing in early inflammatory joint disease, starting with RF, followed by anti-CCP (in patients with RF < 50 U/ml), and finally anti-RA33, should be used as a sensitive and effective strategy for distinguishing patients with RA at high risk for poor outcome.

### Profiling of rheumatoid arthritis associated autoantibodies [^4a0d9411]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

An increasing number of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated autoantibodies (AAB) are available for AAB profiling that may improve the early diagnosis of RA and provide prognostic and, probably theranostic information. To select AAB specificities for optimal AAB combinations, known AAB should be evaluated with standardized methods by means of standardized study designs and subjected to statistical analysis. Profiling of anti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPA), anti-A2/RA-33 antibodies, and rheumatoid factors (RF) IgM and IgA improves the serologic diagnosis of RA using cut-offs corresponding to 98% specificity for each parameter included. Currently, the combination of anti-CCP antibodies with RF IgM and RF IgA is recommended either in parallel or by stepwise determination. Because anti-CCP antibody demonstrated the best diagnostic performance for profiling, this AAB should be used for first-line screening. The main advantage of AAB profiling is the increased sensitivity for RA diagnosis. Additional benefits of AAB profiles comprise the increased diagnostic specificity of particular AAB combinations (e.g. ACPA plus RF or RF IgM plus RF IgA) and their possible association with disease development and/or therapy response. The inclusion of novel RA-associated AAB (RAAB) and use of clinically evaluated multiplex assays may facilitate the use of profiling in diagnostic routine laboratories.

### Reexamining remission definitions in rheumatoid arthritis: considering the twenty-eight-joint disease activity score, C-reactive protein level and patient global assessment [^6dff0a59]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Editor's note

The Editors of the 5 journals of the American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology have been reminded by this editorial that ACR and EULAR have jointly agreed on various classification criteria, definitions, recommendations, or points to consider, which do not always find reflection in manuscripts submitted to the journals. Consequently, in the future, the Editors will enforce the use of the products obtained in the course of joint ACR/EULAR or EULAR/ACR activities in all respective papers. For rheumatoid arthritis this would mean use of the ACR/EULAR or EULAR/ACR classification criteria, remission definitions, recommendations on what to report in clinical trials, and others, as pertinent. The same applies to other diseases. There are valid and important reasons that these activities have been undertaken by ACR and EULAR, and therefore, the conclusions of the various task forces, which have been endorsed by ACR and EULAR, should be respected by investigators and study administrators. This does not mean other methods could not be used in a study, but at the least, the reports should address the methods agreed upon by the 2 organizations. Maintaining uniformity across major publications regarding rheumatoid arthritis remission or other definitions not only allows for more appropriate comparison across analyses, but also enhances readers' ability to interpret results. Author instructions across the 5 journals will more strongly reflect this requirement.

### Do we need to lower the cut point of the 2010 ACR / EULAR classification criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis? [^d89d8167]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria to identify more patients with RA among early inflammatory arthritis patients.

Methods

We included early arthritis patients from the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort with at least one joint with clinical synovitis and symptoms for < 1 year, with no other explanation for their symptoms. The demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient were recorded at baseline. Patients were classified as case or non-case at the 1-year follow-up by the definition used in the development of the 2010 criteria (MTX initiation). To assess the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria, the sensitivity and specificity at each cut point were determined.

Results

We included 557 patients in our analysis. At the 1-year follow-up, 253 patients (45%) were classified as case (MTX use). In the group of patients who scored 0–5 points (n = 328), 98 patients (30%) were classified as case (MTX use). The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria using the cut point of 6 were 61% and 76%, respectively. With the cut point of 5, the sensitivity would increase to 76% and the specificity would decrease to 68%.

Conclusion

By lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria from 6 to 5 points, we were able to identify 15% more RA patients at the cost of 8% more false-positive patients.

Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have recently emerged as sensitive and specific serological markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), providing superior alternative of the rheumatoid factor (RF) test in the laboratory diagnostics of RA. The first members of this autoantibody family were anti-perinuclear factor (APF) and anti-keratin antibodies (AKA). It became evident that both APF and AKA recognize citrullinated epitopes of filaggrin. Citrullination is a post-translational modification of arginine by deimination, physiologically occurring during apoptosis, inflammation or keratinization. The presence of several citrullinated proteins has been demonstrated in the RA synovium. The identification of citrullinated epitopes as targets for anti-filaggrin antibodies led to the development of the first and later second generation anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody assays. The widely used anti-CCP2 assays have high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and they also show important predictive and prognostic value in RA. The anti-Sa antibody has been identified a decade ago; however, recent studies confirmed that anti-Sa is directed against citrullinated vimentin, hence it is a new member of the family of ACPAs. The newly developed anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCV) assay has similar diagnostic performance than the anti-CCP2 ELISA; however, the diagnostic spectrum of the anti-MCV test is somewhat different from that of anti-CCP2. It's especially useful in the diagnosis of RA in RF and anti-CCP2 seronegative patients. The combined application of anti-CCP2 and anti-MCV assays can improve the laboratory diagnostics of RA. The family of ACPAs is expected to expand; there is an increasing need for developing new diagnostic strategies after careful evaluation of the characteristics of the available assays.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis. subgroup characteristics and comparisons between rheumatoid arthritis-like subgroups and ankylosing spondylitis-like subgroups [^6a6f7735]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

In terms of adult-onset definitions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are rarely diagnosed in children. Adult RA is in most aspects similar to seropositive polyarticular arthritis in children, but AS differs in its clinical presentation according to age at onset. In general, the nomenclature and classifications of arthritis in children encompass subgroups with specific signs or laboratory tests and pathogenic mechanisms that distinguish one clinical form from the other. While one of these subgroups corresponds to RA, the one related to AS usually includes children with undifferentiated SpA and not definite AS. Thus, comparisons of RA and AS in children actually correspond to comparisons of various forms of childhood arthritis, currently classified as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and AS in its early undifferentiated form. In this paper, we review these to finally compare the two populations.
