## Question

1 year old with eczema now with more widespread rash concerns for impetigo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a 1-year-old with eczema and a widespread rash concerning for impetigo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pre-test probability given age and atopic dermatitis. Then, I should characterize the lesions and determine disease extent. Next, I need to decide on diagnostics, including whether to culture. After that, I will select empiric therapy based on extent and likely pathogens, while planning to tailor to culture results. Concurrently, I must optimize atopic dermatitis care and assess for coinfections and complications. Finally, I will outline preventive measures and a concrete follow-up timeline, while keeping key differentials in mind and self-verifying assumptions at each step.

> Let me consider baseline risk first. In toddlers, impetigo is common, with an incidence around 206 per 100,000 person-years in those under 18 years, and atopic dermatitis substantially increases susceptibility to cutaneous bacterial infections through barrier dysfunction and S. aureus colonization, raising the odds of impetigo by roughly 55 percent in cohort data, so the pre-test probability here is high and warrants serious consideration of impetiginization superimposed on eczema [^115AqAC7] [^1169YisK].

> Next, I should review the morphology and distribution to separate localized from widespread disease and to look for hallmark features. Impetigo classically evolves from erythematous papules to vesicles or pustules that rupture, leaving honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base; bullous impetigo presents with flaccid bullae, often in flexural areas, and in children with AD it can be confused with or coexist with eczema, which means I need to carefully look for crusting, weeping, and pustules superimposed on eczematous skin and count lesions to determine if this is widespread (> 10 lesions or large surface area), as that will guide therapy intensity [^1169YisK] [^11699DEX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing; I should confirm whether cultures are indicated. While empiric treatment based on a typical clinical presentation is acceptable, Gram stain and culture of pus or exudate are recommended by IDSA to identify S. aureus versus β-hemolytic Streptococcus, and in a widespread eruption on an AD background with possible MRSA risk, obtaining swabs before or at the time of starting therapy will help tailor treatment and support stewardship, so I will obtain lesion swabs now if feasible [^115sBtfH] [^112bwZ7j] [^116pxvKP].

> For localized disease, I need to verify topical options and dosing. Topical mupirocin 2% applied three times daily is effective for impetigo and is FDA-labeled for this indication, with strong clinical and microbiological cure rates in pediatric populations; topical therapy alone is usually sufficient for limited body surface involvement, which aligns with both IDSA and AAFP guidance, so that remains first-line if lesions are few and small [^116yDAXB] [^111h1fVi] [^112Njy1r] [^11715gzp].

> Now, for widespread disease in this 1-year-old, I should initiate systemic therapy while cultures are pending. Cephalexin 25–50 mg/kg/day divided QID for 7 days is an IDSA-endorsed first-line option given that most S. aureus isolates in impetigo are MSSA, and it also covers S. pyogenes; I initially thought amoxicillin-clavulanate might also cover "some MRSA", but wait, let me verify — amoxicillin-clavulanate does not provide MRSA coverage, though it is reasonable against MSSA and streptococci, so if MRSA is a concern or no improvement occurs, I should pivot to an MRSA-active agent such as clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole while considering local resistance patterns [^115Bo85M] [^112zyE1F] [^111GN5r7].

> Let me double-check alternative topical agents, because my initial note said ozenoxacin 1% is FDA-approved only for adults — wait, that needs correction. High-quality randomized trials include children as young as 2 months with demonstrated efficacy and tolerability over 5 days of twice-daily application, supporting its use in pediatric impetigo and indicating it is not adult-only, though local availability and labeling should still be verified in practice [^116kxG6g] [^111L6Rsh].

> I will now examine how to tailor therapy once cultures return. If cultures yield streptococci alone, penicillin VK is recommended; if MRSA is isolated or strongly suspected clinically, clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are appropriate oral options per consensus and MRSA guidelines, with choice guided by susceptibility and patient tolerance; macrolides, especially erythromycin, face notable resistance and are generally not preferred [^1158JWET] [^111GN5r7] [^112zyE1F].

> Concurrent management of atopic dermatitis must continue thoughtfully. I should confirm that we maintain liberal emollients and use low-potency topical corticosteroids on non-infected, intact eczematous areas to restore barrier function, while avoiding application over frankly infected, crusted, or exudative lesions; I need to remember that topical neomycin and bacitracin or disinfectants are not recommended for impetigo and may irritate, and although a pediatric burns cohort suggested faster resolution with combined oral antibiotics plus topical steroids for impetigo-like secondary infection, that setting is different and should be extrapolated cautiously [^1165hdmc] [^116HLPxW] [^116LLyni].

> Next, I should review coinfections and complications to avoid missing factors that undermine treatment. Scabies can coexist in a meaningful minority of pediatric impetigo cases and reduces treatment success, so I will examine for pathognomonic signs like burrows and nocturnal pruritus and treat scabies if present; I also need to plan for poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis surveillance given its 1–5 percent risk after nonbullous impetigo, arranging a urine check for hematuria and proteinuria 2–3 weeks after onset, and if there is no clinical response by 48–72 hours, I should re-evaluate for MRSA, alternative diagnoses, or complications [^116RmfBS] [^114Q88Ae] [^116pxvKP] [^111GN5r7].

> I need to ensure prevention and supportive measures are emphasized. Gentle cleansing of crusts, trimmed nails, and minimizing autoinoculation reduce spread, and because impetigo is highly contagious, I should counsel on avoiding close contact and sharing of towels or linens until crusts have resolved with therapy; if scabies is suspected or confirmed in the household, I will consider family screening and treatment to prevent reinfection and improve outcomes [^116pxvKP] [^114Q88Ae] [^116Zx6RD].

> Let me outline a follow-up timeline and self-check the milestones. Reassessment at 48–72 hours is critical to confirm improvement; a 7-day antibiotic course is typical for uncomplicated impetigo; I should revisit culture results to narrow therapy promptly; and at 2–3 weeks, I will arrange urine screening for PSGN in streptococcal-associated cases, escalating care if there is clinical deterioration or systemic illness, including consideration of IV therapy when warranted [^115Bo85M] [^116pxvKP] [^112bwZ7j].

> But wait, what if this is not impetigo or not only impetigo? In children with severe AD and vesiculopustular or erosive eruptions, I should keep a high index of suspicion for eczema herpeticum, which presents with painful, punched-out erosions and systemic symptoms and requires urgent antiviral therapy, and I should also remember that disseminated bullous impetigo in AD is often misdiagnosed initially as an eczema flare, so careful lesion morphology, culture, and early response to appropriate antibiotics help differentiate these entities [^111kjE7o] [^114RQw2R].

> Pulling this together for this 1-year-old with severe eczema and widespread suspected impetigo, my plan is as follows. I will obtain bacterial swabs of crusted or weeping lesions for Gram stain and culture before initiating therapy when feasible, start systemic cephalexin 50 mg/kg/day divided QID for 7 days for broad MSSA and streptococcal coverage, add topical mupirocin 2% to focal lesions three times daily, continue emollients and low-potency topical corticosteroids on non-infected eczematous skin only, screen for scabies and treat if present, counsel on hygiene and contagion precautions, re-evaluate in 48–72 hours to confirm clinical response and tailor based on culture results, and arrange urine screening in 2–3 weeks to assess for poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis; if MRSA is identified or there is poor early response, I will switch to an MRSA-active oral regimen such as clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole per susceptibilities and local resistance data, correcting my earlier assumption about amoxicillin-clavulanate and MRSA coverage and ensuring I adjust therapy accordingly [^112bwZ7j] [^115Bo85M] [^116yDAXB] [^111GN5r7] [^116pxvKP] [^116RmfBS].

A 1-year-old with eczema who develops a more widespread rash is at **increased risk for impetigo** [^115AqAC7] due to skin barrier defects and scratching [^1169YisK]. Impetigo is suggested by **honey-colored crusts** [^116pxvKP] and rapid spread, especially on the face and extremities [^115Ko85Q]. Confirm with a **clinical exam** [^116pxvKP] and, if atypical or severe, obtain **bacterial cultures** [^115sBtfH] [^112bwZ7j]. Treat localized disease with topical mupirocin [^116yDAXB] or ozenoxacin [^116kxG6g] [^111L6Rsh]; use oral cephalexin [^115Bo85M] or clindamycin for extensive or MRSA-suspected cases [^111GN5r7]. Continue eczema care [^1169YisK] and monitor for complications such as cellulitis [^notfound] or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [^116pxvKP].

## Clinical features differentiating impetigo from eczema

Impetigo and eczema can overlap, but **key differences** help distinguish them:

| **Feature** | **Impetigo** | **Eczema (atopic dermatitis)** |
|-|-|-|
| Lesion appearance | Honey-colored crusts [^116pxvKP]; vesicles or bullae [^116wmEs5]; erosions [^1169YisK] | Erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches [^1169YisK]; lichenification [^115Ko85Q] |
| Distribution | Face, extremities, perioral, perinasal [^115Ko85Q] | Flexural areas, cheeks, scalp [^1169YisK] |
| Progression | Rapid spread [^116pxvKP]; autoinoculation [^114EwzT8] | Chronic, relapsing course [^115Ko85Q] |
| Systemic symptoms | Rare; fever, lymphadenopathy possible [^116wmEs5] | Rare; usually localized [^1169YisK] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with additional tests as indicated:

- **Clinical examination**: Look for honey-colored crusts [^116pxvKP], vesicles, bullae [^116wmEs5], and rapid spread [^1169YisK].
- **Bacterial culture**: Obtain from lesions if atypical, severe [^115sBtfH], or unresponsive to initial therapy [^112bwZ7j].
- **Differential diagnosis**: Consider eczema herpeticum [^111kjE7o], scabies [^114Q88Ae], tinea [^115Uicf2], and other infectious or inflammatory conditions.

---

## Recommended treatment strategies

Treatment depends on **severity and extent**:

| **Severity** | **Treatment** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Localized (≤ 5 lesions) | Topical mupirocin [^116yDAXB] or ozenoxacin [^116kxG6g] [^111L6Rsh] | 5–7 days |
| Extensive (> 5 lesions) or MRSA suspected | Oral cephalexin [^115Bo85M], clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^111GN5r7] | 7–10 days |

---

Adjunctive measures include continuing **eczema care** [^1169YisK], avoiding scratching, and maintaining **hygiene** to prevent spread [^114EwzT8].

---

## Potential complications

If untreated or inadequately managed, **impetigo** may lead to:

- **Cellulitis**: Deeper skin infection [^116wmEs5].
- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**: Rare kidney complication [^115DgkHG].
- **Sepsis**: Rare systemic infection [^116pxvKP].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing **impetigo** in children with eczema involves:

- **Skin care**: Regular emollients and gentle cleansing [^1169YisK].
- **Infection control**: Hand hygiene and avoiding contact with infected individuals [^116wmEs5].
- **Prompt treatment**: Early management of eczema flares and secondary infections [^111FX78s].

---

A 1-year-old with eczema and a widespread rash is at **increased risk for impetigo** [^115AqAC7]. Clinical features, bacterial cultures, and appropriate treatment are essential for management [^112bwZ7j].

### Topical antibacterial agent for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: Pooled analysis of phase 3 clinical trials [^111L6Rsh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Ozenoxacin is a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria that has been developed as a 1% cream for the treatment of impetigo. This article presents pooled results of pivotal clinical trials of ozenoxacin, with the objective of evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin 1% cream after twice-daily topical treatment for 5 days in patients with impetigo. A pooled analysis was performed using individual patient data from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 registration studies conducted in patients with impetigo. Both clinical trials followed a similar methodology. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ozenoxacin or vehicle, and one trial included retapamulin as an internal control.

- **Efficacy**: Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture.
- **Safety and tolerability**: Safety and tolerability were evaluated. Ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success versus the vehicle after 5 days of therapy, superior microbiological success versus the vehicle after 2 days of therapy, and was safe and well-tolerated.

Ozenoxacin showed superior clinical and microbiological response versus the vehicle in children as young as 2 months of age, and adults, with impetigo.

### Increased risk of cutaneous and systemic infections in atopic dermatitis-a cohort study [^115AqAC7]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

We examined the prevalence of multiple common cutaneous and noncutaneous infections (warts, dermatophyte infection, impetigo, molluscum contagiosum, otitis media, pneumonia, and streptococcal throat infection; codes available in Supplementary Table S1 online). We found that all of the infectious illnesses we predetermined to test were more prevalent in those with atopic dermatitis (AD). Using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, we examined the odds of each infectious outcome at any time point. We found that the strength of association for cutaneous infections varied from a 55% increased odds of impetigo to a three-fold increased odds of molluscum contagiosum after adjusting for sex, age, time of observation, and practice. Associations with noncutaneous infections varied from a 27% increased odds of streptococcal throat infections to a two-fold increase in otitis media.

We performed sensitivity analyses exploring the definition of AD. When we estimated the association with a longer list of less-specific dermatitis codes (see Supplementary Table S1), we found that most associations were diminished. When we estimated the association with a more narrow designation, AD plus asthma or seasonal rhinitis, the magnitude of most of the associations increased. This highlighted a potential link between underlying immune dysfunction in atopic disease and increased susceptibility to infection.

Prior publications have found higher rates of infections among patients with AD, but most of them…

The following constitutes key background information on ecthyma and impetigo:

- **Definition**: Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Ecthyma is a deeply ulcerated form of impetigo that extends into the dermis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Impetigo is nearly always caused by S. aureus and/or β-hemolytic Streptococcus species. Community-acquired MRSA is an increasingly frequent etiological agent.

- **Epidemiology**: Impetigo predominantly affects children. In patients under 18 years of age, the incidence of impetigo is estimated at 206 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Impetigo begins as erythematous papules that rapidly evolve into vesicles and pustules that rupture, with the dried discharge forming honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base. Ecthyma begins as vesicles that rupture, resulting in circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts, often with surrounding erythematous edema.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a serious complication that affects between 1 and 5 percent of patients with nonbullous impetigo. Rheumatic fever does not appear to be a potential complication of impetigo. Impetigo usually resolves without scarring within two weeks if left untreated. Unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.

### Children atopic dermatitis: Diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^1169YisK]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Impetigo**: Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection caused mainly by Staphylococci and Streptococci, characterized by pain, erythema, and serum scabs. It may be confused with atopic dermatitis (AD) or coexist with it. Typically, it presents with oozing serum that has dried up, giving it a honey‐crusted appearance surrounded by an erythematous base. Impetiginous lesions may also present with fluid‐filled blisters (bullous impetigo). Furthermore, impetigo can occur in eczema-affected skin that is open and "weepy". Individuals with AD are more likely than the general population to have colonized Staphylococcus aureus, leaving them more prone to infections.

- **Molluscum dermatitis**: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral infection of the skin, especially in children. It is found more frequently in individuals with AD, but there is not necessarily an association. Skin barrier defects predispose patients with AD to MC, and long‐term scratching leads to the spread by autoinoculation. MC infection in AD has been associated with FLG mutations. Diagnostic doubt arises when an itchy eczema (molluscum dermatitis) develops around the molluscum. However, a careful objective examination will highlight the papule of MC.

Regarding medical management for ecthyma and impetigo, specifically with respect to oral antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering dicloxacillin PO 250 mg QID or cephalexin PO 250 mg QID for 7 days as first-line oral antibiotic therapy in most patients with ecthyma or impetigo, given that causative *S. aureus* isolates are usually methicillin-susceptible.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ecthyma and impetigo, specifically concerning Gram stain and culture, IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining Gram staining and culture of the pus or exudates from skin lesions in patients with impetigo and ecthyma to help identify whether S. aureus and/or a β-hemolytic Streptococcus is the cause.

### Treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin infections in the pediatric and adolescent patient populations [^1176HJpQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Before 1980, superficial pyodermas in the US were caused primarily by streptococci. Studies conducted in Miami show that during the early 1980s, the predominant pathogen associated with impetigo in pediatric patients shifted from Streptococcus pyogenes to Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequent reports revealed a trend of increasing resistance of S. aureus to penicillins. By regularly monitoring local sensitivity patterns, physicians are more likely to select the appropriate antibiotic. The recommendation for the treatment of pediatric skin disease is cephalosporins due to their low likelihood of resistance by S. aureus.

### Use of primary care data for detecting impetigo trends, United Kingdom, 1995–2010 [^113KwpeU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although changes in health-seeking behavior or data recording could underlie the increased consultation rate, the fact that similar increases were reported from other primary and secondary care datasets suggests that our findings are not artifacts. The Read codes used to identify patients were unchanged throughout the study period, and we are unaware of any changes in clinical practice that would lead to an increased tendency to diagnose impetigo.

Impetigo is frequently dismissed as a mild infection that spontaneously resolves with a good outcome. By contrast, this study suggests that an undetected increase in impetigo in the community drove a major increase in hospital admissions of children in England from 1989–1990 through 2003–2004. Awareness of this epidemic by general practitioners could have triggered the development of specific guidelines on the management of this condition, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing hospital admissions.

Routinely collected primary care data are an underused and potentially rich source of information about infectious diseases in the community. We should do more to find novel ways of incorporating this information into international surveillance networks and using it to guide evidence-based treatment and prescribing decisions in primary care.

### Pediatric burn wound impetigo after grafting [^116HLPxW]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Modern burn care techniques have reduced the risk of infection of the acute burn wound, resulting in more rapid healing and a lower incidence of graft loss. However, secondary breakdown may still occur. The loss of epithelium associated with multifocal superficial abscesses and ulceration has been termed burns impetigo, which may result in considerable morbidity and require prolonged treatment.

The events preceding development, the impact on the patient, and the ideal treatment appear unclear and poorly reported. Over a five-year period between 2006 and 2011, 406 pediatric burns were treated with skin grafts, with 7% developing burns impetigo. The time to resolution ranged from 5 to 241 days. The mean time to complete healing was greatest with conservative management (96 days), followed by antibacterial dressings (37 days), oral antibiotics (36 days), topical steroids (16 days), and oral antibiotics in combination with topical steroids (13.5 days).

Burns impetigo resulted in significant morbidity, requiring multiple visits to the treatment center and prolonged symptoms. Delays in diagnosis and treatment resulted in worse outcomes. Prompt consideration of burns impetigo should occur when postgraft patients present with suggestive clinical signs, and treatment with oral antibiotics plus topical steroids should be considered.

### Risk factors for severe impetiginized atopic dermatitis in Japan and assessment of its microbiological features [^1123ma3B]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are susceptible to cutaneous bacterial infection. When such patients develop an infection, some experience extensive impetiginized dermatitis accompanied by high fever. To clarify the risk factors for severe impetiginized AD and its microbiological features, we reviewed clinical and microbiological data of 14 patients with impetiginized AD admitted to our hospital between 1999 and 2006. All patients had poorly controlled AD with eczematous lesions over a large body surface. The mean age was 28.2 years (range 18–35). Cultures of the lesional skin yielded both *Streptococcus pyogenes* and *Staphylococcus aureus* in 12 patients, while *S. pyogenes* alone was isolated in two cases. These observations suggest that poorly controlled AD in adults is a risk factor for severe impetiginized AD, and that *S. pyogenes* might play an important role in the development of severe clinical symptoms.

### Topical corticosteroid withdrawal in a pediatric patient [^1175TLXk]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis included TCS withdrawal, impetigo, herpes simplex, pustular psoriasis, and acute localized exanthematous pustulosis. Bacterial and viral cultures were obtained, and the patient was given empiric doxycycline and continued on acyclovir while cultures were pending. She was also instructed to restart triamcinolone ointment on her face, every other day, with a slow taper off. The cultures were negative, and on a phone follow-up 4 days later, the parents reported that the patient's face had returned to normal. She was continued on a taper of topical triamcinolone to hydrocortisone ointment and continued on oral doxycycline.

### The limping child: Evaluation and diagnosis [^117BjqJz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

A limp is a common reason for a child to present to the orthopaedist. Because of the long list of potential diagnoses, some of which demand urgent treatment, an organized approach to evaluation is required. With an understanding of normal and abnormal gait, a directed history and physical examination, and the development of a differential diagnosis based on the type of limp, the patient's age, and the anatomic site that is most likely affected, the orthopaedist can take a selective approach to diagnostic testing. Laboratory tests are indicated when infection, inflammatory arthritis, or a malignant condition is in the differential diagnosis. The C-reactive protein assay is the most sensitive early test for musculoskeletal infections; an abnormal value rapidly returns to normal with effective treatment. Imaging should begin with plain radiography. Ultrasonography is particularly valuable in assessing the irritable hip and guiding aspiration, if necessary.

### A 14-year-old girl with multiple, firm, dome-shaped eroded nodules and itching on the limbs [^117HBhsA]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of prurigo nodularis (PN) includes antihistamines, ultraviolet light, and topical and systemic corticosteroids; unfortunately, PN is notoriously resistant to conventional therapy. Herein, a case of PN is described, initialized with herose as the first-line therapy, resulting in complete clinical clearance. Results of follow-up examinations from 2005 to 2009 showed no evidence of recurrence. Findings indicate that herose monotherapy is a potentially promising therapeutic option for PN.

### The importance of scabies coinfection in the treatment considerations for impetigo [^116RmfBS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). High credibility.

Skin infections account for a high disease burden in Indigenous children living in northern Australia. Although the relationship between impetigo and scabies is recognized, the prevalence of scabies in children with impetigo is not well reported. We report the prevalence, demographics, and treatment success outcomes of impetigo and scabies coinfection in Indigenous children who were participants in a randomized controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia.

- **Methods**: Of 1715 screening episodes for impetigo, 508 children were randomized to receive intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin (BPG), twice daily co-trimoxazole (SXT) for 3 days (4 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 20 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose), or once daily SXT for 5 days (8 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose). A clinical diagnosis of scabies, tinea of the skin, scalp or nail, and head lice was made on all children. Scabies presence was not confirmed using diagnostic scrapings. In a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether coinfection with scabies had an impact on treatment success for impetigo.

- **Results**: Of children randomized to receive treatment for impetigo, 84 of 508 (16.5%) had scabies. The presence of scabies ranged from 14.3% to 20.0% in the three treatment groups. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection, independent of the treatment groups, was 75.9% and 86.6%, respectively, with an absolute difference of 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): +1% to +21%].

### Mupirocin [^111h1fVi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in two clinical trials.

- **First trial**: Subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or a vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations (including adults and pediatric subjects) were 71% for mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in these populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for vehicle placebo.

- **Second trial**: Subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment three times daily or 30 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg of oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day, in an unblinded trial, for 8 days. A follow-up visit occurred one week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (including adults and pediatric subjects) were 93% for mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both groups.

- **Pediatrics**: In the first trial, there were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial, all subjects were pediatric, except two adults in the mupirocin group. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years.

### Ectoparasites: Scabies [^114Q88Ae]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Scabies is a disease that can be associated with several clinical features, including the burrow ink test, delta wing jet sign, itching that worsens at night, skin burrows, and a papulovesicular rash. Additional symptoms may include skin nodules, impetigo, skin excoriations, pruritus, skin bullae, skin crusts, and the mini-triangle sign.

### Bullous impetigo: A rare presentation in fulminant streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [^115xuMUr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Since the mid-1980s, an increase in the incidence of invasive disease caused by group A streptococci has been noted among adults and children. The characteristic clinical and laboratory features of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome include deep-seated infection associated with shock, skin manifestation, and multiorgan failure. However, bullous impetigo is invariably considered to be a staphylococcal disease. Staphylococcus aureus produces an epidermolytic toxin, assumed to be the cause of bullous formation in the skin. Here, we present a case of bullous impetigo in an infant with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; this is a rare presentation of bullous impetigo caused by group A streptococcus.

### Treatment of impetigo in the pediatric population: Consensus and future directions [^113KZvir]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common contagious superficial bacterial skin infection. Treatment of localized lesions can be achieved through topical antibiotics, while oral antibiotics are reserved for extensive disease. Increasing antimicrobial resistance to existing therapies has raised concerns. Antimicrobial stewardship, achieved through the responsible use of antibiotics, is an important measure to reduce bacterial resistance. This review highlights treatment options for impetigo and shares consensus statements to help guide the management of impetigo in the pediatric population.

- **Objective**: An expert panel of dermatologists and pediatricians convened in February 2019 to establish evidence-based consensus on the management of impetigo in the pediatric patient population.

- **Methods**: The consensus was created in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. Prior to the consensus meeting, a systematic literature review was conducted, with the selected literature deemed clinically relevant to the consensus statements. Statements were further refined and assessed systematically following established standards. The consensus process consisted of a modified Delphi approach, and the consensus was established through a minimum 75% "agree" rate.

- **Results**: Thirteen consensus statements were developed addressing clinical challenges, existing treatment options and their limitations, and new therapeutic alternatives.

- **Conclusion**: Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials commonly used in treating impetigo has been reported. Antimicrobial stewardship is crucial to managing this resistance effectively.

### Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo [^114EwzT8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin infection that most commonly affects children two to five years of age. The two types of impetigo are nonbullous impetigo (i.e. impetigo contagiosa) and bullous impetigo. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but rarely a culture may be useful. Although impetigo usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without scarring, treatment helps relieve the discomfort, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent the spread of an organism that may cause other illnesses (e.g. glomerulonephritis).

There is no standard treatment for impetigo, and many options are available. The topical antibiotics mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective and may be superior to oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be considered for patients with extensive disease. Oral penicillin V is seldom effective; otherwise, there is no clear preference among antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides, although resistance rates to erythromycin are rising. Topical disinfectants are not useful in the treatment of impetigo.

### First trimester impetigo herpetiformis in multiparous female successfully treated with oral cyclosporine [^113hR9he]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Impetigo herpetiformis, or gestational pustular psoriasis, can account for 4.25% of all pregnancy dermatoses seen. Unlike other pregnancy dermatoses, it can be associated with constitutional symptoms, including fever, rigors, and arthralgia, as well as complications such as secondary infection and sepsis. There is an increased risk of fetal anomalies and stillbirths. A 25-year-old para 1 presented to primary care at 7 weeks gestation with a peri-umbilical rash non-responsive to topical steroids and underwent hospital admission at 31 weeks gestation with fever and a widespread painful erythematous rash. Her condition worsened despite high-dose oral steroids. With the use of cyclosporine and regular opioid analgesia over two weeks, her symptoms were adequately controlled. She went into spontaneous labour at 41(+2) weeks and delivered a healthy male infant. Impetigo herpetiformis can be treated first line with topical and oral steroids and supportive measures, but immunomodulatory therapies such as cyclosporine have shown success in treating resistant cases.

### The generalized rash: part I. Differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment.

In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Impetigo herpetiformis unresponsive to therapy in a pregnant adolescent [^114B18wQ]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular disorder affecting mainly pregnant women. We report a 16-year-old adolescent primigravida who presented with impetigo herpetiformis at 27 weeks of gestation. She had a pustular erythroderma covering her entire body, except the face, scalp, and palmoplantar regions, with severe pruritus and pain. After unsuccessful attempts at treatment with systemic corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, treatment was switched to cyclosporine, but no therapeutic effect could be achieved. Because of the deteriorating condition of the patient, an early delivery decision was made. Her symptoms resolved after delivery, and by day 20 postpartum, her skin lesions were completely resolved.

### Seasonal occurrence of impetigo: A retrospective 8-year review (1996–2003) [^115JWvoi]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Impetigo, a common skin infection, has shown seasonal variation in studies conducted in Africa, Australia, and India. We investigated the seasonal variation of impetigo in a UK pediatric population. A total of 1,552 children with impetigo were seen in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department between 1996 and 2003. The number of impetigo cases was consistently higher in late summer than in winter and increased year over year. These changes could not be explained by variations in the total number of patients seen in A&E, suggesting a correlation between the frequency of impetigo and climatic temperature. Possible reasons for these findings include exposed skin due to loose clothing in the summer, leading to more skin-to-skin contact and minor trauma.

### Common pediatric and adolescent skin conditions [^112143Jm]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine; therefore, it is important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of the description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders, such as vitiligo, are depicted. Cutaneous growths found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication.

Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema consist of scaling patches and plaques. Poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically includes topical emollients and corticosteroids, while phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases. Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease in the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating; therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic.

Vascular anomalies are most commonly exemplified as port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with a pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress.

### Reduced bacterial skin infections in HIV-infected African children randomized to long-term cotrimoxazole prophylaxis [^115imnFo]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

The global burden of bacterial skin infections has generally been underappreciated; a recent systematic review estimated that 162 million children are affected at any time by impetigo, predominantly in tropical, low-income countries. In tropical regions, *S. pyogenes* is the predominant pathogen causing impetigo; despite previous uncertainty, *S. pyogenes* is susceptible to cotrimoxazole in vitro.

A trial among indigenous Australian children with impetigo showed the noninferiority of short-course oral cotrimoxazole compared with intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin for treatment. There is increasing recognition that *S. aureus* is also an important cause of skin infections in tropical settings and that *S. pyogenes* and *S. aureus* coinfection is common. Published cotrimoxazole resistance rates among *S. aureus* isolates from sub-Saharan Africa are 25–100%, suggesting that cotrimoxazole has limited efficacy for staphylococcal skin infections; however, high intracellular concentrations may facilitate its antibacterial activity.

It has been noted in many previous studies that cotrimoxazole retains prophylactic activity against a range of infections despite high rates of resistance among causative organisms. It is also plausible that the benefits of cotrimoxazole for skin infections are particularly driven by its activity against *S. pyogenes*; there are few published data on cotrimoxazole resistance among *S. pyogenes* isolates in sub-Saharan Africa.

### Treatment of impetigo: Oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed [^113wF4zr]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin disease frequently seen in children. While data support the use of topical antibiotics for treatment, the medications actually prescribed in practice are not well documented.

- **Objectives**: To determine the prescribing patterns of dermatologists and non-dermatologists when treating impetigo and the demographics of the patients treated.

- **Methods**: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data on office visits for impetigo were analyzed from 1997 to 2007. Patient demographics and the treatments for impetigo were recorded.

- **Results**: During this 10-year period, dermatologists managed an estimated 274,815 impetigo visits and non-dermatologists an estimated 3,722,462 visits. Both dermatologists and non-dermatologists most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics to treat impetigo. Topical antibiotics were second most common, and a variety of combination treatments were used.

- **Conclusions**: Oral antibiotics are the most common class of medications used to treat impetigo. There is an opportunity for physicians to take advantage of the equally efficacious topical antibiotics for treating impetigo. A shift towards topical antibiotics would likely decrease morbidity resulting from adverse effects associated with the use of oral agents.

### Bacterial resistance and impetigo treatment trends: a review [^114Vvzdj]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common cutaneous infection that is especially prevalent in children. The prevalence of colonization and infection with resistant strains is continually increasing, forcing clinicians to reevaluate treatment strategies. Newer topical agents are effective in treating infections with resistant strains and may help minimize resistance and adverse effects from systemic agents. The use of topical disinfectants to decrease colonization is an important adjunctive measure. Physicians should be aware of local resistance patterns in impetigo to help guide therapy.

### Common skin rashes in children [^115Ko85Q]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash, the clinical course, and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection.

- **Roseola**: The key feature is a rash presenting after the resolution of a high fever.

- **Pityriasis rosea**: Distinguishing features are a herald patch and a bilateral, symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern.

- **Scarlet fever**: The rash usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles.

- **Impetigo**: A superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children.

- **Erythema infectiosum**: Characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the "slapped cheek" facial rash.

- **Molluscum contagiosum**: Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with this highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention.

- **Tinea**: A common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails.

- **Atopic dermatitis**: A chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.

### New insights into pustular dermatoses in pediatric patients [^1157WzNi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pustular eruptions are common in the pediatric population. The focus of this review is to highlight entities that present with pustules, signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation, and other organ involvement. Although these conditions are rare, awareness of them should facilitate early recognition, faster evaluation (including genetic testing, if appropriate), and adequate treatment.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^115PmxzW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods - Study setting and recruitment**: This was a community randomized open-label study conducted in Malaita Province of the Solomon Islands. Six communities were randomized to one of two arms: an ivermectin arm or a combined-treatment arm. We selected communities that were isolated from each other to reduce contamination between the two study arms. All residents living in selected communities were eligible to participate. Community engagement and education were conducted by the study team prior to the commencement of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from adults and from the parent or guardian of children. Assent was also obtained from children who were able to provide it.

- **Data collection**: Study visits took place at three time points. At baseline, participants were seen for enrollment, initial data collection, and treatment. At three months, we reexamined children (aged ≤ 12 years) in each community to allow for the collection of swabs to monitor for antimicrobial resistance [see below]; this age group was selected as they were anticipated to have the highest prevalence of impetigo. At the 12-month follow-up visit, we again aimed to examine all participating residents in participating communities. Prior to visits at both baseline and 12 months, the study team conducted a village census. At baseline and 12 months, participants underwent a standardized examination by an experienced clinician (MM) with data recorded on the presence or absence of any skin lesions, their location, and whether they were consistent with scabies, impetigo, or another diagnosis.

### Unexplained fractures: Child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^1147kvp6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem, and an improper diagnosis carries tremendous consequences for the patient, their family, and the doctor. A substantial degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with a missed diagnosis, with a reinjury rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 10% for unprotected children. Additionally, the emotional trauma for the patient and family undergoing a prolonged investigation by Child Protective Services (and possibly even the wrongful removal of custody) demonstrates the power of a misguided diagnosis of abuse. With fractures representing the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft tissue trauma, orthopedic surgeons are at the forefront of evaluating patients with potential CAN.

Many studies have described the musculoskeletal manifestations of child abuse: rib fractures, skull fractures, humeral and femur fractures are among the most common. Recent studies demonstrated that the combination of patient age and fracture location can reproducibly differentiate abuse from accidental trauma. Among these factors, a suspicious history, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months are associated with CAN.

In 1962, Kempe et al. introduced the concept of "battered child syndrome". They included osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) as part of the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with potential abuse. The authors noted that OI should be easily distinguishable from abuse based on history and physical examination. Despite their assertions, ther

### Differentiating hidradenitis suppurativa flare from infection in the emergency department and recommendations for transitioning care to the outpatient setting [^111YSahf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a painful and often progressive inflammatory skin condition characterized by papules, nodules, abscesses, and tunnels, particularly in the axillary, inframammary, and anogenital regions. Differentiating HS from a skin infection, such as a bacterial abscess, can be challenging. However, this differentiation is crucial since the management of HS often necessitates long-term follow-up and specialist care. Emergency physicians should be well-versed in distinguishing acute HS flares from similarly presenting conditions, particularly skin and soft tissue infections encountered in the emergency department. Furthermore, appropriate steps should be taken to ensure adequate transition of care to the outpatient setting.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^112VrynA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Impetigo bullosa – Incorrect. Impetigo bullosa is a skin infection caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, with rarely appearing intact vesicles or bullae. Typically, the lesions are copious, especially in the mouth and nose regions. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained with Gram stain and culture.
	- B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of the main types of bullous epidermolysis, represented by fragility of the skin, leading to nonscarring blisters and erosions due to minor mechanical trauma. Its diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing and skin biopsy.
	- C. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) – Correct. DCM is characterized by generalized infiltration of mast cells in the skin, with frequent formation of bullae. Bullous lesions are frequently observed, with reports of involvement in 62% to 69% of patients, and may even be the first presentation of DCM. Bullae appear mainly on the trunk, scalp, and extremities, developing into erosions and thickening of the skin. Clinically, patients have pruritus, generalized erythema, pachydermia, and a darker skin color compared with normal skin. Histologic examinations are typically performed to assist in diagnosis. Frequent follow-up and proper treatment are essential for significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes.
	- D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome
	- E. Erythema multiforme

### Gentamicin sulfate [^117QMxNx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Indications and usage: Gentamicin sulfate is primarily indicated for skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. It is also used for secondary skin infections, including infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial superinfections of fungal or viral infections.

Please note that gentamicin sulfate is a bactericidal agent, but it is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. It is beneficial in treating infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage, allowing adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Positive outcomes have been reported in treating infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery.

Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with gentamicin sulfate, although regular observation is advisable when treating any patient sensitive to topical antibiotics. Gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1%, is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections and greasy secondary infections such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. The ointment formulation helps retain moisture and has proven effective on dry eczematous or psoriatic skin. If a water-washable preparation is preferred, the cream is advisable.

### Atopic dermatitis complicated by severe impetigo in a Syrian refugee infant [^114jak6F]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 3-month-old infant with atopic dermatitis who developed severe impetigo. The child was born to Syrian refugees shortly after they arrived in Canada. The case demonstrates the rapid and nearly complete resolution of dramatic skin findings following a course of hydrocortisone ointment and oral antibiotics with adjuvant measures.

For resettled refugees, access to family physicians and local language proficiency are common barriers that negatively impact their health and healthcare. We discuss how the healthcare model in one Canadian city addresses these issues in the context of this case. The case also raises questions about the burden of dermatological conditions in refugees while in transit and in countries of resettlement. The few reports that exist suggest that some conditions may be relatively common and that the epidemiology warrants additional investigation.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^116Zx6RD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

At 12 months, the prevalence of scabies and impetigo had fallen to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3–2.6%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.4–4.5%), respectively, in the ivermectin-only treatment arm and to 0.7% (95% CI 0.2–1.8%) and 3.3% (95% CI 2.1–5.1%), respectively, in the combined treatment arms (Table 2). There was no significant difference between the two groups (91.5% vs. 92.4%, P = 0.31) in the change from baseline to 12 months in scabies prevalence or in the change in impetigo prevalence (75.2% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.49).

- **Prevalence of scabies and impetigo**:
	- We performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis to assess whether the lower follow-up in the ivermectin-only arm might have affected our results. We calculated the prevalence of impetigo that would have been seen in the ivermectin-only treatment arm if we had achieved a follow-up at a level similar to the combined treatment arm and the prevalence among participants not seen at 12 months had been unchanged from baseline. Under these assumptions, the prevalence of impetigo in the ivermectin-only treatment arm would have been 4.1% at twelve months. In this analysis, there was no significant difference in the relative reduction in impetigo between arms (60.2% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.23).

Swabs were collected from 73 people with impetigo at baseline, 36 people at 3 months, and 22 people at 12 months. At baseline, 80% of impetigo lesions from which we obtained a swab yielded S. aureus on culture, and 62% yielded pyogenic streptococci (predominantly S. pyogenes, 56%). At 3 and 12 months, the proportion of S. aureus was unchanged (78% and 86%, respectively), but the data is incomplete.

### International comparison of guidelines for management of impetigo: A systematic review [^111FX78s]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common superficial skin infection that affects people worldwide and is usually treated with antibiotics; therefore, its management has implications for global antibiotic stewardship.

- **Objective**: This systematic review and narrative synthesis compares and contrasts international impetigo management guidelines.

- **Methods**: Guidelines for the treatment of impetigo that were produced by a national authority, available to primary care physicians, and published since 2008 were included. Following a comprehensive search strategy, data extraction from eligible studies was performed independently in duplicate. Details of antiseptic and antibiotic treatment, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treatment, and conservative management and preventative measures were tabulated and analyzed descriptively.

- **Results**: Fifty-one guidelines were included from 42 different countries. All guidelines recommended systemic antibiotics, with 78% of these advised only for widespread lesions or failure of topical antibiotic treatment. The first-line systemic antibiotic treatment was restricted to narrow-spectrum options in 21 (41%), while 7 (14%) recommended only broad-spectrum antibiotics as first-line. Thirty-four (67%) guidelines included recommendations for topical antibiotic use. Twenty guidelines (39%) did not mention antiseptic treatment for impetigo. Guidelines did not always provide clear indications for different treatment options.

- **Conclusions**: Despite potentially equal efficacy to systemic antibiotics, only two-thirds of guidelines include topical antibiotic options.

### Do antimicrobial resistance patterns matter? An algorithm for the treatment of patients with impetigo [^11699DEX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly occurring in young children, although adults may also be affected. The superficial skin infection is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and, less frequently, by Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide concern and must be addressed when selecting treatment for impetigo patients. An evidence-based impetigo treatment algorithm was developed to address the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.

- **Methods**: An international panel of pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists employed a modified Delphi technique to develop the impetigo treatment algorithm. Treatment recommendations were evidence-based, taking into account antimicrobial stewardship and the increasing resistance to oral and topical antibiotics.

- **Results**: The algorithm includes education and prevention of impetigo, diagnosis and classification, treatment measures, and follow-up and distinguishes between localized and widespread or epidemic outbreaks of impetigo. The panel adopted the definition of localized impetigo as fewer than ten lesions and a smaller than 36 cm² area affected in patients of two months and older with no compromised immune status. Resistance to oral and topical antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of impetigo, such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid, has been widely reported.

- **Conclusions**: When prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to know the local trends in antibiotic resistance.

### A 3-year-old child with multiple superficial erosions and yellowish crusts on the scalp and seborrheic areas [^115tgBE4]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:
	- **Bullous impetigo – Incorrect**: Bullous impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection. Although in this condition, antibodies also target DSg1 similar to PF, the clinical course is distinct. Bullous impetigo generally resolves in 1–2 weeks and responds favorably to systemic and topical antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. The organism should be apparent in the staining findings of the tissue.

	- **Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect**: The histopathology of psoriasis typically reveals several distinctive features including elongation of rete ridges and the presence of neutrophils in the epidermis, notably in the form of Munro's microabscesses. DIF is typically negative in psoriasis.

	- **Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) – Correct**: PF is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder in children. The cutaneous manifestations are often found on the face, scalp, axilla, intertriginous region, and, in particular instances, the seborrheic distribution. Characteristics include crusted plaques and superficial erosions in a polycyclic pattern that can progress to erythroderma and exfoliative dermatitis. Histological examination revealed an intraepidermal blister with acantholytic cells within or adjacent to the granular layer. Dsg1 is being targeted and DIF revealed IgG and C3 deposition in a granular pattern at the intercellular junction, confirming the diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus.

### Bullous impetigo rapid diagnostic and therapeutic quiz: A model for assessing basic dermatology knowledge of primary care providers [^1168hFNv]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common dermatologic condition, particularly in children, yet confusion regarding its diagnosis and treatment persists. This study measured pediatricians' ability to diagnose and appropriately treat BI and explored factors that might influence pediatricians' accuracy in managing BI.

- **Methods**: We administered an expert-validated survey to 64 pediatrics house staff and faculty at three Johns Hopkins Medicine facilities. The survey requested demographic information, diagnoses for five "unknown" cases, and preferred treatments for localized and widespread BI.

- **Results**: Overall, BI was diagnosed correctly 31.9% of the time. There was little difference between house staff and faculty performance, although faculty 50 years of age and older demonstrated better diagnostic acumen. Regarding treatment of localized BI, 92% of faculty members and 84.6% of house staff listed mupirocin as first- or second-line treatment. The second most common medication listed for localized BI was bacitracin. Regarding treatment of widespread BI, faculty listed cephalexin or clindamycin as first- or second-line treatment 56.0% of the time, and house staff listed one of these two medications 51.3% of the time. Results for faculty 50 years of age and older were comparable.

- **Conclusions**: Improved pediatrician proficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of BI is needed for safe, cost-effective management. Physician age and experience appear to have a limited effect on the accuracy of BI diagnosis and management. Future educational efforts must be directed at training.

### Topical minocycline foam for the treatment of impetigo in children: Results of a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study [^116zn4jC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Currently available treatment options for impetigo are limited by either systemic side effects associated with oral therapy or a lack of ease of use with topical ointments. A novel foam formulation of minocycline for topical use may improve convenience and treatment utilization for pediatric patients with impetigo.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied minocycline foam (FMX-102 1% and 4%) in the treatment of impetigo and to determine the optimal therapeutic active ingredient concentration.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, comparative clinical trial, 32 subjects aged ≥ 2 years with a clinical diagnosis of pure impetigo, impetigo contagiosa, or uncomplicated blistering impetigo were randomized to treatment with FMX-102 1% or 4%, applied twice daily for 7 days. Subjects were followed for up to 7 days post-treatment.

- **Results**: Clinical cure, defined as ≥ 80% cured lesions (fully recovered lesions, visually determined by investigators) was achieved by 57.1% and 50.0% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, at the end of treatment (visit 3). Clinical success, defined as the absence of lesions or the drying or improvement of treated lesions (decrease in size of affected area, lesion number, or both), was demonstrated in 81.3% and 78.6% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, following 3 days of treatment (visit 2); in 92.3% and 100% of the respective subjects at the end of treatment; and in 100% in both groups at follow-up (visit 4). Bacteriologic success rates at the end of treatment, defined as complete pathogen eradication, were also measured.

### Emergency department utilization for impetigo among the pediatric population: A retrospective study of the national emergency department sample 2013–2015 [^115UM6dH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the large burden of impetigo in childhood and the high frequency of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits for skin conditions, limited information exists on the use of EDs for impetigo among US children. Our study aimed to generate national estimates of ED utilization and to identify sociodemographic predictors of impetigo-related ED visits.

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of children ages 1–17 presenting to EDs with a primary diagnosis of impetigo using years 2013–2015 of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Impetigo accounted for 163,909 of the 71,488,511 pediatric ED visits and was the fourth most common presenting skin diagnosis. Controlling for sociodemographic factors, patients presenting to the ED with impetigo were most likely to be 6–11 years old, male, and from lower-income quartiles. Patients were most likely to be uninsured and most likely to present on weekends in the summer.

This study provided national-level estimates of ED use for impetigo among US children. Ultimately, the identification of factors associated with increased ED utilization may help in developing targeted interventions to reduce the use of emergency care for impetigo.

### It looks like childhood eczema but is it [^113is5MC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

In childhood, the most common type of eczema or dermatitis is atopic dermatitis, which occurs in up to 25% of children worldwide. However, diagnosing this condition may sometimes be challenging, as atopic dermatitis can resemble other types of dermatitis, as well as other skin diseases such as psoriasis, infections, infestations, and malignancies. Additionally, metabolic, genetic, and autoimmune disorders may appear similar. This review focuses on how to recognize the most common types of dermatitis in children and adolescents and how to differentiate them from the most common differential diagnoses, both clinically and histologically.

### A review of common pediatric lip lesions: Herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas [^1124j51u]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Lip lesions are a common presentation to the pediatrician's office. These lesions are often benign in children, without significant functional morbidity. However, owing to the prominent placement of lips and their role in communication, lip lesions can be alarming to patients as well as to their parents. For these reasons, the pediatrician has an important role in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating the various types of labial dermatoses that commonly present to a pediatric practice. Four of the most common lip lesions a pediatrician will see are herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas. This paper reviews the literature on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these four lesions.

### Disseminated bullous impetigo and atopic dermatitis: Case series and literature review [^114RQw2R]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common skin infection of early childhood, resulting from desmoglein-1 cleavage by Staphylococcus aureus exfoliative toxins. Due to compromised barrier function and immune dysregulation, children with atopic dermatitis (AD) are at increased risk of cutaneous infections. However, no literature has been published on disseminated bullous impetigo (DBI) in children with atopic dermatitis. We sought to explore the atopic phenotypes, antibiotic sensitivities, and treatment courses of children diagnosed with disseminated bullous impetigo at our institution.

We conducted a retrospective case series of 12 children diagnosed with disseminated bullous impetigo at Johns Hopkins from December 2016 to May 2017. Eleven children (92%) had severe AD. All children were initially misdiagnosed; the majority (67%) were misdiagnosed with AD flares, and other misdiagnoses included scabies, eczema herpeticum, ecthyma, varicella, and eczema coxsackium. All cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Three children (25%) had clindamycin-resistant strains of MSSA, and only one child was positive for both MSSA and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All children were treated with systemic antibiotics and experienced resolution of symptoms within 24–48 hours.

This case series is the first of its kind exploring children with DBI with the atopic diathesis. Our results indicate that DBI is often misdiagnosed, and increased training is likely needed for pediatricians, emergency room physicians, and dermatologists.

### A 3-year-old child with multiple superficial erosions and yellowish crusts on the scalp and seborrheic areas [^112T7fYZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What are the treatments of this skin condition?

- **A. Doxycycline**: Incorrect. Doxycycline is an antibiotic used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria.
- **B. Itraconazole**: Incorrect. Itraconazole is an antifungal drug that specifically treats fungal infections.
- **C. Griseofulvin**: Incorrect. Griseofulvin is an antifungal medicine specifically used to treat fungal infections.
- **D. Cloxacillin**: Incorrect. Cloxacillin is specifically used to treat gram-positive bacterial infections.
- **E. Rituximab**: Correct. Rituximab, corticosteroids, methotrexate, and cyclosporine have all been used to treat pemphigus foliaceus. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy; however, other systemic immunosuppressive medications such as cyclosporine and methotrexate have been used as steroid-sparing medications. Rituximab was recently approved in Europe and the United States as a first-line therapy for moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. A recent guideline recommends the use of rituximab as a major therapeutic approach in adults with pemphigus disease. The following first-line therapies of moderate and severe pemphigus in adults are recommended to start rituximab (two infusions of 1 g two weeks apart) associated with systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) with a progressive tapering in order to stop corticosteroids after 6 months. There is very little data on therapy in children. The presenting case was treated with rituximab (375 mg/m²/dose) for two courses with three-week intervals.

### Allergic contact dermatitis to benzoyl peroxide resembling impetigo [^115bfcfx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old boy presented with recurring severe dermatitis of the face for a duration of 5 months that resembled impetigo. He had been treated with several courses of antibiotics without improvement. A biopsy showed changes consistent with allergic contact dermatitis, and patch testing later revealed sensitization to benzoyl peroxide, which the patient had been using for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^116rBw1F]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Differentiating bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) can occasionally present a significant clinical challenge. In the 18th and 19th centuries, physicians mistakenly christened infantile BI as pemphigus neonatorum, highlighting the significant clinical similarity between the two diseases. Although rare reports exist of severe BI in the immunocompetent adult population, the infrequency can confound correct diagnosis.

Patients with BI and PF can both present with crusted, scaly superficial erosions with morphologically indistinguishable, easily denuded blisters. Although similarly flaccid, the blisters of PF are typically smaller, with lesions as large as 1 to 2 cm being uncommon. Another useful clinical differentiator to consider is the rapidity of disease progression. BI tends to generalize quickly, as was the case with our patient, whereas PF is more likely to progress over weeks to months. In both conditions, lesions localize to the superficial epidermis, commonly sparing mucous membranes. This phenomenon is due to desmoglein-1-specific pathology, which allows for desmoglein compensation at mucosal sites. These sites have much higher levels of desmoglein-3 expression when compared with the nonmucosal epidermis.

Histologically, the blisters of both BI and PF are subcorneal, exhibiting dyskeratotic, acantholytic granular cells in the superficial epidermis, where desmoglein-1 is preferentially expressed. In one study, neonatal mice injected with either exfoliative toxin A — the toxin characteristically produced by S. aureus in BI — or PF antibodies were found to develop both clinical and histological symptoms consistent with the diseases.

### Topical corticosteroid withdrawal in a pediatric patient [^1179Sy7S]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Topical corticosteroid (TCS) withdrawal was first described by Sneddon in 1968. It is a clinical adverse effect resulting from the inappropriate prolonged and frequent use of mid- to high-potency TCS, most commonly on the face or genital region. This effect is distinct from other well-documented effects like skin atrophy and steroid rosacea; it is precipitated by the sudden cessation of TCS.

It typically affects middle-aged women who have used a mid- or high-potency TCS on the face, usually for atopic dermatitis. In a systematic review by Hajar and colleagues, only 7% of reported cases occurred in patients younger than 18 years.

The literature on steroid withdrawal dermatosis describes two morphologically distinct subtypes: a papulopustular variant and an erythematoedematous variant, which sometimes overlap.

In our case, the patient best fits the papulopustular subtype, showing prominent pustule features rather than the erythematous scaling and burning or stinging symptoms seen in the erythematoedematous variant.

The triad of erythema, edema, and extensive pustulation occurs rapidly after the cessation of long-term application of fluorinated corticosteroids for facial rash treatment, often rosacea. In pediatric literature, cases are noted where nonspecific dermatitis treated with fluorinated steroids causes steroid rosacea, leading to a "rebound phenomenon" upon attempting to discontinue the topical treatment. This typically occurs within the first week of cessation and includes an increase in.

### Analytical study of pustular eruptions in neonates [^117X3ppW]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pustular eruptions are commonly encountered in neonatal practice. Much confusion exists among clinicians because of the similarity in clinical lesions, paucity of relevant literature, and varied nomenclature used for these diseases. This often results in inappropriate diagnoses and therapies, besides subjecting the neonates to invasive and traumatic investigative procedures. We conducted a comprehensive study of pustular eruptions in 100 neonates, using clinical examination and simple laboratory tests to arrive at a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this problem.

Of the 100 neonates with pustular eruptions, 36% were in the early neonatal period (first week of life). A slight male preponderance with a male-to-female ratio of 1:0.79 was observed. The majority of the families of these infants had poor socioeconomic status (96%) and were living in slums (71%). A study of their educational status revealed that 54% of the mothers were uneducated. Fifty-seven percent of the neonates were born at home.

The clinical pattern of diseases among these neonates was that 58% of them had infections, including impetigo (23%), intertrigo (14%), scabies (6%), and viral diseases (6%). Noninfectious diseases (42%) included miliaria pustulosa, erythema toxicum neonatorum, epidermolysis bullosa, and contact dermatitis. Simple laboratory investigations helpful in establishing the diagnosis were smears processed with Gram (24%) and Giemsa (39%) stains, and wet mounts with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (27%) for direct microscopic examination.

### Efficacy and safety of ozenoxacin cream for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: A randomized clinical trial [^116kxG6g]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Ozenoxacin, a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, has been developed as a cream with 1% active drug for the treatment of impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin cream, 1%, after 5-day twice-daily topical treatment in patients with impetigo.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial included patients 2 months or older with impetigo who were enrolled at centers in 6 countries from June 2, 2014, through May 30, 2015. Data were analyzed based on intention to treat from July 9 through July 22, 2015.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive topical ozenoxacin or placebo control.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Among the 411 patients who received treatment (210 males [51.1%]; mean [SD] age, 18.6 [18.3] years), ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success compared with placebo, which was evident after 5 days of therapy (112 of 206 [54.4%] vs. 78 of 206 [37.9%]; p = 0.001). Ozenoxacin also demonstrated superior microbiological success compared with placebo after 2 days of therapy (109 of 125 [87.2%] vs. 76 of 119 [63.9%]; p = 0.002). Ozenoxacin was well tolerated, with 8 of 206 patients experiencing adverse effects, with only 1 of these potentially related to the study treatment; none were serious.

### Neonatal miliaria pustulosa-a case series [^112UNPf8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Infectious causes of pustular eruptions in neonates include bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens. Bacterial infections that may present with pustules include impetigo, staphylococcal pustulosis, congenital syphilis, or secondary bacterial infections complicating a primary dermatologic condition or wound. Folliculitis is another common pustule-forming condition due to both fungal and bacterial organisms. Folliculitis may present similarly to miliaria pustulosa, but the pustules will be folliculocentric, whereas in miliaria pustulosa, the pustules are non-follicular.

Congenital, as well as neonatal candidiasis, can also present with pustules. Congenital candidiasis tends to be a more widespread eruption of macules, papules, pustules, and occasionally bullae; pustules on the palms and soles can be a helpful diagnostic finding. Neonatal candidiasis is more often a localized eruption in the diaper area, sometimes accompanied by oral thrush.

Viral causes of neonatal pustules include HSV and VZV, both of which are serious and concerning causes of disease in a neonate. HSV and VZV eruptions tend to be more vesicular than pustular, becoming punched out erosions with hemorrhagic crusting that is not seen in miliaria.

### Levofloxacin [^113WQTJD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections**: Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (mild to moderate), including abscesses, cellulitis, furuncles, impetigo, pyoderma, and wound infections, due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

- **Chronic bacterial prostatitis**: Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

- **Inhalational anthrax (post-exposure)**: Levofloxacin is indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis. The effectiveness of levofloxacin is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.9)].

- **Plague**: Levofloxacin is indicated for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and prophylaxis for plague in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older.

### Osteomyelitis in immunocompromised children and neonates, a case series [^1163FCQM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

In developed countries, acute osteomyelitis (OM) occurs in about 8 in 100,000 children, with boys being affected more than girls. The classical clinical picture includes an unwell and pyrexic child with pain and signs of inflammation around a long bone. The most common sites include the femur (23–29%), tibia (19–26%), and humerus (5–13%). Most of our cases involved the long bone, which is congruent with the literature. However, we have also demonstrated that unusual infection sites need to be considered in immunocompromised patients, reporting infections of the tarsal and metatarsal bones, phalanges of the hand, and base of the skull. These are sites that are estimated to be involved in less than 1% of OM cases.

The classical presentation of a child with OM includes fever, bone pain, reduced ambulation, and bone swelling. They can also present with generalized malaise. Severe tenderness, reduced range of movement, local edema, erythema, and warmth can be commonly found on physical examination. Our case series highlights that immunocompromised children are less likely to present with these classical features, which could be due to the inability of a compromised immune system to produce an adequate inflammatory response. About 64% of our patients presented with a fever over 38°C, 66.7% presented with bone pain, and 28.6% presented with reduced active mobility, with their sensitivity in detecting OM in our patient pool being 64.3%, 42.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. This demonstrates the difficulty of clinically diagnosing an immunocompromised child with OM.

### Eczema herpeticum: Would you know it if you saw it [^111kjE7o]. Pediatric emergency care (2015). Low credibility.

Eczema herpeticum is an easily missed entity most commonly seen in the pediatric population and carries the risk of systemic compromise and a 10% mortality rate. Clinicians should maintain high clinical suspicion when encountering children or young adults with a history of atopic dermatitis or other erosive dermatoses and who present with vesicular lesions, punched-out erosions, and systemic symptoms. We present three severe cases of eczema herpeticum that were potentially overlooked and demonstrate the need for elevated awareness to avoid potential pitfalls.
