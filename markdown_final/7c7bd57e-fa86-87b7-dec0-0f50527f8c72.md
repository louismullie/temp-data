## Question

What is the treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the treatment is for a given condition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that treatment depends on the specific disease and patient context. Then, I should verify how to classify the condition and align choices with guideline-based care. Next, I will consider severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences. After that, I should review evidence hierarchies and appraise the strength of recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and note special scenarios and uncertainties, ensuring I cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: there is no universal "treatment" without knowing the disease, its stage, and the patient's context, so I need to ensure we anchor on disease-specific, guideline-concordant therapy rather than a one-size-fits-all answer.

> I will now examine how to classify the condition, because treatment pathways diverge by category such as infectious, chronic inflammatory, cardiovascular, psychiatric, oncologic, genetic, or degenerative disease; I should double-check that the chosen framework matches major guidelines and that I am not mixing pediatric and adult pathways inadvertently.

> Next, I should review severity stratification, since many diseases use severity tiers to dictate intensity of therapy; for example, COVID-19 distinguishes mild-to-moderate, severe, and critical illness, and COPD management is staged by symptoms and exacerbation risk, so I need to ensure I map the patient to the correct severity band before recommending escalation [^1162YcrS] [^1132YYap].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about comorbidities; I need to check for co-occurring conditions that modify risk, contraindications, and sequencing of therapies, because guidelines emphasize integrated, multidisciplinary care in multimorbidity and explicitly call out how comorbidities alter treatment choices and follow-up cadence [^111dck8y] [^111PT6aC].

> I should confirm patient preferences and goals of care, since shared decision-making is repeatedly emphasized in high-quality guidelines and directly shapes whether to pursue aggressive disease-modifying therapy, palliative strategies, or observation; I need to ensure the plan aligns with what matters to the patient, not just what is biologically plausible [^117M8Q9Z].

> Now, I will appraise the evidence hierarchy; I need to prioritize systematic reviews and meta-analyses, then randomized controlled trials, then observational studies, and finally expert opinion, while also noting when real-world evidence complements RCTs and when evidence is sparse or conflicting; this helps me avoid overinterpreting low-certainty data [^117HGCCw] [^111H7959].

> Let me think about concrete examples to anchor this: for COVID-19, I should confirm that inhaled corticosteroids are conditionally recommended only in select ambulatory patients and not broadly, that convalescent plasma is generally not recommended outside narrow contexts, and that antivirals are reserved for specific populations and timing; I should double-check each of these against IDSA updates before concluding [^116sXmFV].

> For COPD, I should verify that nonpharmacologic measures such as smoking cessation, vaccination, inhaler technique, and pulmonary rehabilitation are foundational, and that pharmacologic escalation follows symptom and exacerbation risk strata; I need to ensure I do not omit these non-drug pillars because they materially change outcomes [^115pASXk].

> For depression, I should confirm that first-line treatment is often psychotherapy or a second-generation antidepressant, with switching or augmentation strategies for inadequate response; I should double-check that augmentation with a second-generation antipsychotic is a reasonable option in treatment-resistant cases and that CBT remains a strong alternative or adjunct [^116dJZcg] [^112e8kXW] [^111EzeEL].

> For chronic non-cancer pain, I need to remember that most modalities yield modest benefits and that multidisciplinary, combined approaches are often necessary; I should caution against expecting large effect sizes from any single intervention and emphasize functional goals and safety monitoring [^115QrLJe].

> But wait, what if the condition is "difficult-to-treat" or multifactorial; I should consider that refractory presentations often reflect misdiagnosis, psychosocial drivers, or limited options, and that a holistic, multidisciplinary reassessment can uncover modifiable barriers and redirect therapy more effectively than simply escalating drugs [^115F2bGJ].

> I should also review special scenarios: in pediatrics, many pathways mirror adult principles but require age-specific dosing and safety considerations; in genetic or mitochondrial diseases, disease-modifying options may be emerging but translation to clinical practice remains challenging; in resource-limited settings, cost and access constraints may necessitate pragmatic choices that still align with evidence-based care [^113HAmNW] [^114MduhR].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach: confirm the diagnosis and stage severity using accepted criteria; screen for comorbidities and contraindications; align options with patient values; select guideline-concordant first-line therapy with the best benefit–risk profile; set measurable targets and a monitoring plan; reassess at predefined intervals and escalate or switch based on response and tolerability; and embed nonpharmacologic measures and coordination of care throughout [^111q88H7] [^115pASXk] [^117M8Q9Z].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have not overpromised benefit; where evidence is low certainty or conflicting, I need to communicate uncertainty, discuss trade-offs, and, when appropriate, consider enrollment in clinical trials or registry programs to advance care and potentially access emerging therapies [^117HGCCw] [^1171h5FL].

The treatment is **condition-specific and individualized** [^111q88H7], guided by disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^112zQ87B]. For most chronic diseases, **first-line therapy** follows evidence-based guidelines (e.g. metformin for type 2 diabetes [^117Xom8X], inhaled bronchodilators for COPD [^115pASXk], SSRIs for depression [^112e8kXW]), with escalation or switching if response is inadequate [^116ovRvS]. Acute conditions often require immediate, targeted interventions (e.g. antibiotics for infection, thrombolysis for stroke, surgery for appendicitis). Nonpharmacologic measures (lifestyle change, rehabilitation, psychotherapy) are integral [^115QrLJe], and shared decision-making is essential to align care with patient goals [^117M8Q9Z]. Regular monitoring and adjustment are standard to optimize outcomes and minimize harm [^116UaXtv].

---

## General principles of treatment

- **Individualized care**: Tailor treatment to disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^112zQ87B].
- **Evidence-based guidelines**: Use current guidelines to guide initial and ongoing therapy [^111q88H7].
- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in decisions to improve adherence and satisfaction [^117M8Q9Z].
- **Regular monitoring**: Adjust therapy based on response and adverse effects [^116UaXtv].

---

## Chronic disease management

- **Diabetes**: Lifestyle change and metformin first-line; add insulin or other agents if needed [^117Xom8X].
- **Hypertension**: Start with thiazide or ACE inhibitor; titrate to target blood pressure.
- **COPD**: Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids; pulmonary rehabilitation [^115pASXk].
- **Depression**: SSRIs or CBT first-line; augment or switch if inadequate response [^112e8kXW].

---

## Acute condition management

- **Infection**: Prompt antibiotics based on pathogen and local resistance patterns.
- **Stroke**: Thrombolysis within window; aspirin for secondary prevention.
- **Myocardial infarction**: Reperfusion and antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy.
- **Appendicitis**: Surgical removal to prevent rupture.

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

- **Gene therapy**: Under study for genetic disorders (e.g. sickle cell, osteogenesis imperfecta) [^1132kz2k] [^115giMrV].
- **Immunotherapy**: Advancing in cancer (e.g. CAR T, checkpoint inhibitors) [^113PCfvL].
- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring therapy to genetic and phenotypic profiles [^113JeczJ].

---

## Barriers and challenges

- **Treatment burden**: Polypharmacy and complex regimens reduce adherence [^114dbjH7].
- **Access and cost**: Limit uptake of effective therapies.
- **Adverse effects**: Require monitoring and dose adjustments [^115gkKx5].
- **Patient factors**: Beliefs, literacy, and social determinants affect outcomes [^117M8Q9Z].

---

## Conclusion

Effective treatment is **condition-specific**, evidence-based, and patient-centered, with regular monitoring and adjustment to optimize outcomes [^111q88H7].

### The concept of difficult-to-treat disease in rheumatology: where next? [^115F2bGJ]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

New pathogenesis-based therapeutics and evidence-based consensus treatment recommendations, often with predefined treatment goals, have remarkably improved outcomes across many chronic diseases. However, a clinically significant subgroup of patients responds poorly to interventions and show a progressive decline in the disease trajectory, which poses an increasing health-care challenge. Difficult-to-treat approaches exist in several areas of medicine and the need for similar definitions has recently also emerged in rheumatology. The term difficult-to-treat refers not only to patients with pathology-driven, treatment-refractory disease, but also implicates multiple other factors that can contribute to patients being in this state, including having few treatment options, misdiagnosis, and coincident psychosocial factors. Therefore, the difficult-to-treat state requires a comprehensive, holistic, multidisciplinary approach that considers the specific characteristics of each disease and the personalised needs of the patient. In this Personal View, we provide an overview of the different aspects of the concept of difficult-to-treat disease, highlight its advantages, and propose the importance of incorporating this concept more widely in the design of rheumatological treatment strategies.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: where we are now? [^1132kz2k]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

The landscape of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD. Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative or highly disease- modifying option for abating the complications of the disease. Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their end points, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the long-term use of this therapy.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^116vsX8x]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### Treatment works, so who's afraid of PNES? [^114Xjk1X]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Yet now we have information suggesting that basic collaboration and attending psychotherapy visits yield a robust improvement, possibly rivaling the effect sizes of anticonvulsants for electrical seizures. When we have treatment options, the fear of a condition decreases. The stigma of the condition also reduces. Patients with cancer in the 1970s or major depression in the 1980s would not admit that they had these conditions for fear of being ostracized socially. But as treatment improved, people "survived" cancer and recovered from depression, and the diagnoses lost their power to induce fear. Fear and worry still exist for PNES, as evidenced by the fact that both neurologists and psychiatrists apparently resist taking responsibility to treat this condition. It exists because events themselves cause fear and clinicians are unsure how to help, yet as treatment outcomes improve, fear dissipates.

It seems that this could be a reality in PNES as well. If patients are engaged in a therapeutic treatment process, then they learn how to understand the antecedents and contexts for the events. They learn that all is not lost if an event recurs. They learn that they can live with the condition and even improve. They may have relapses, but begin to understand that they will recover. Interestingly, what happens if the word "epilepsy" is substituted for "PNES" in the first sentence of this paragraph? None of the meaning is lost at all; perhaps basic treatment approaches are similar between PNES and epilepsy, and both can be managed without undue fear among clinicians and caregivers alike.

### Therapies for mitochondrial disease: past, present, and future [^114MduhR]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Mitochondrial disease is a diverse group of clinically and genetically complex disorders caused by pathogenic variants in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA‐encoded genes that disrupt mitochondrial energy production or other important mitochondrial pathways. Mitochondrial disease can present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and can often be difficult to recognize. These conditions can be devastating; however, for the majority, there is no targeted treatment. In the last 60 years, mitochondrial medicine has experienced significant evolution, moving from the pre‐molecular era to the Age of Genomics in which considerable gene discovery and advancement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disease have been made. In the last decade, in response to the urgent need for effective treatments, a wide range of emerging therapies have been developed, driven by innovative approaches addressing both the genetic and cellular mechanisms underpinning the diseases. Emerging therapies include dietary intervention, small molecule therapies aimed to restore mitochondrial function, stem cell or liver transplantation, and gene or RNA‐based therapies. However, despite these advances, translation to clinical practice is complicated by the sheer genetic and clinical complexity of mitochondrial disease, difficulty in efficient and precise delivery of therapies to affected tissues, rarity of individual genetic conditions, lack of reliable biomarkers and clinically relevant outcome measures, and the dearth of natural history data. This review examines the latest developments in the pursuit to identify effective treatments for mitochondrial disease and discusses the barriers impeding their success in translation to clinical practice. While treatment for mitochondrial disease may be on the horizon, many challenges must be addressed before it can become a reality.

### Radiation enteritis: from diagnosis to management [^112Da7x5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As cancer treatments improve more patients than ever are living for longer with the side effects of these treatments. Radiation enteritis is a heterogenous condition with significant morbidity. The present review aims to provide a broad overview of the condition with particular attention to the diagnosis and management of the condition.

Recent Findings

Radiation enteritis appears to be more prevalent than originally thought because of patient underreporting and a lack of clinician awareness. Patient-related and treatment-related risk factors have now been identified and should be modified where possible. Medical and surgical factors have been explored, but manipulation of the gut microbiota offers one of the most exciting recent developments in disease prevention. Diagnosis and treatment are best approached in a systematic fashion with particular attention to the exclusion of recurrent malignancy and other gastrointestinal conditions. Surgery and endoscopy both offer opportunities for management of the complications of radiation enteritis. Experimental therapies offer hope for future management of radiation enteritis but large-scale human trials are needed.

Summary

Radiation enteritis is an important clinical problem, but awareness is lacking amongst patients and physicians. Clinical guidelines would allow standardised management which may improve the burden of the disease for patients.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^113v2sst]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CD is a chronic relapsing-remitting disease with a high morbidity rate. Its disease complexity can result in long-lasting physical, emotional, and psychological effects on patients. Over the past two decades, the medical compendium for the treatment of CD has expanded exponentially. Although surgery continues to play a pivotal role in achieving disease control for these patients with aggressive disease, novel mechanistic approaches and deeper insights with existing therapies hold real promise. The prospect of these intellectual efforts being rewarded through meaningful outcomes for individuals living with CD is now more realistic than ever before.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116dJZcg]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adolescent depression — psychotherapy recommendations: The panel's comprehensive review leads to the recommendation for the use of psychotherapy to treat adolescent depression, with the best evidence for interpersonal psychotherapy [adapted for adolescents] and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), enabling a recommendation for both versus no treatment or waitlist and versus treatment as usual or psychological placebo conditions. The evidence base for behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy, play therapy, problem-solving therapy, and psychodynamic and supportive psychotherapy is insufficient for recommendation of any of these treatments versus no treatment or waitlist and versus treatment as usual or psychological placebo conditions, and there was insufficient evidence for the panel to recommend for or against clinicians offering any of the psychotherapies over any of the other psychotherapies listed.

### Ten ways to improve the use of statistical mediation analysis in the practice of child and adolescent treatment research [^1127UvhV]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment Conditions

With regard to treatment conditions in youth mediation studies, there are at least five possibilities. The first one is to have no treatment comparison condition; the experimental condition is the only treatment of interest, and changes in the mediator during this treatment are investigated. The problem with investigating mediators in single treatment designs is that no evidence can be found that changes in the mediator are caused by the active treatment and not by other factors (such as passage of time). But sometimes, practical considerations hinder the use of a comparison condition, and ethical considerations can often be the reason why random assignment to a wait list condition is not feasible. In this case, several ways are proposed in which a stronger evidence for mediation can be achieved. First, it is better not to use statistical approaches that rely on between treatment-differences (i.e. Baron and Kenny; Kraemer et al.). The studies by Hogendoorn et al. and Maric et al. illustrate the use of alternative statistical approaches (e.g. MacKinnon) for single-condition designs. Second, a potential non-mediating variable, which is assumed not to be affected by the active treatment, can be included (MacKinnon). A third alternative is to examine the influence of treatment dosage (e.g. 4 vs. 8 sessions of problem-solving training) on the mediator (e.g. self-control) and to investigate whether greater dosages lead to greater changes in the mediator which, in turn, lead to beneficial treatment outcome (Stice et al.). Still, despite these possibilities, in the absence of a treatment control group, alternative explanations for the mediating effects cannot be ruled out.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115pASXk]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Non-pharmacological treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — general principles — states that non-pharmacological treatment is complementary to pharmacological treatment and should form part of the comprehensive management of COPD. After diagnosis, a patient should be given further information about the condition, and physicians should emphasize the importance of a smoke free environment, empower adherence to prescribed medication, ensure proper inhaler technique, promote physical activity, prescribe vaccinations, and refer patients to pulmonary rehabilitation.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^111q88H7]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose of guidelines

As pathophysiology of disease and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, is better understood, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind: to educate providers, particularly in a changing therapeutic landscape; to describe 'best care' through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus and to simultaneously point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions; to reduce inappropriate variation in care and set standards for quality control; to promote efficient use of resources; and to highlight the research that needs to be done to inform future care.

### Depression, pain, and comorbid medical conditions [^115U9cr1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Depression commonly co-occurs with medical illnesses and chronic pain, which can contribute to the somatic symptoms of depression, complicate diagnosis and treatment, worsen patients' prognosis, and hinder recovery. Many therapies are available to treat depression, but patients with depression and pain or medical conditions may require a different treatment strategy than those with depression alone. This activity focuses on the best methods for recognizing and diagnosing these conditions, selecting appropriate therapies to create comprehensive treatment plans, and monitoring and educating patients to improve their quality of life.

### Ezetimibe [^112gpz92]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Ezetimibe (e zet' i mibe) Tablets, USP for oral use

Read this information carefully before you start taking ezetimibe tablets and each time you get more ezetimibe tablets. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about ezetimibe tablets, ask your doctor. Only your doctor can determine if ezetimibe tablets is right for you.

What is ezetimibe tablets?

Ezetimibe tablets is a medicine used with a cholesterol lowering diet:

and with other cholesterol medicines called a statin, or alone (when additional cholesterol lowering treatments are not possible), to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or bad cholesterol in adults with primary hyperlipidemia (too many fats in your blood), including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). HeFH is an inherited condition that causes high levels of bad cholesterol.
and with a statin to lower LDL-C in adults and children 10 years of age and older with HeFH.
and with a medicine called fenofibrate to lower elevated LDL-C in adults with mixed hyperlipidemia.
to lower elevated sitosterol and campesterol levels in adults and in children 9 years of age and older with homozygous familial sitosterolemia (a rare inherited condition that prevents the body from getting rid of cholesterol from plants). Ezetimibe tablets is also used:
with a statin and other cholesterol lowering treatments to lower elevated LDL-C levels in adults and patients 10 years of age and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). HoFH is an inherited condition that causes high levels of bad cholesterol. The safety and effectiveness of ezetimibe tablets has not been established in children:
younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or HoFH.
younger than 9 years of age with homozygous familial sitosterolemia.
with other types of hyperlipemia.

### Multifaceted therapeutic approaches for a multigenic disease [^112cD8er]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a severe chronic disease that affects approximately 200 million individuals worldwide, with extremely debilitating effects and considerably high health care costs. The two major classes of diabetes, known as type 1 (previously known as insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes) and type 2 (non-insulin-dependent diabetes), share common symptoms such as hyperglycemia and the development of long-term complications, but they differ in many aspects, including their etiopathogenesis. New insights suggest that overlapping factors, formerly considered typical hallmarks of each specific type, can coexist in the same diabetic patient, making it difficult to support a sharp distinction between the two classes and, more importantly, to adopt appropriate therapeutic solutions. In type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects, but even more in patients with combined types, multiple genetic factors play a role in determining susceptibility or resistance to the disease, and perhaps also the time of onset, the severity of the symptoms, the possibility of developing complications and, ultimately, the response to therapy. In this review, the therapeutic treatments currently under investigation, as well as the curative strategies envisioned for future applications, are reanalyzed considering the multifaceted and complex aspects of a continuum that can be just defined as "diabetes".

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^111dck8y]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Patients with co-occurring conditions — co-occurring conditions can modify risk, diagnosis, treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall approach to managing Headache; many Veterans, active duty Service members, and their families have one or more co-occurring conditions; because Headache is sometimes accompanied by co-occurring conditions, managing Headache collaboratively with other care providers is often best; some co-occurring conditions might require early specialist consultation to determine necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common understanding of how care will be coordinated; this approach might entail reference to other VA/DoD CPGs (e.g., for Diabetes Mellitus, mTBI, obesity and overweight, pregnancy, PTSD).

### Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges [^112y4RNp]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatment regimes have been explored in the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these treatments may have been tried out of desperation, and among these, some show initial promise. However, it is too early to see any published results of rigorous clinical trials.

Using the serum of recovered patients is a tried and tested approach, and trials are underway to study its effectiveness. This treatment appears to be helpful in the short term until definitive and effective treatments are found.

### Pemivibart (Pemgarda) [^116kff4p]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that:
the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
the known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s).
There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

Information Regarding Available Alternatives for the EUA Authorized Use

There are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives to PEMGARDA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in individuals who are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination.

For information on clinical studies of PEMGARDA and other therapies for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19, see www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111tirQm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^116SGYLn]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism — purpose and therapeutic context — defines undescended testis (UDT) as a common pediatric condition and states treatment aims and current therapy. It notes that cryptorchidism is "one of the most common pediatric disorders of the male endocrine glands and the most common genital disorder identified at birth", that "the main reasons for treatment of cryptorchidism include reducing the risks of impairment of fertility potential, testicular malignancy, torsion and/or associated inguinal hernia", and that "the current standard of therapy in the United States is orchidopexy (also referred to as orchiopexy in the literature), or surgical repositioning of the testis within the scrotal sac; while hormonal therapy has fewer advocates". It cautions that "successful scrotal relocation of the testis, however, may reduce but does not prevent all of these potential long-term sequelae in susceptible individuals".

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112opxsU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline key questions — acute episodic migraine pharmacologic treatment focuses on six key questions: comparative benefits and harms of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients with acute attacks of episodic migraine; comparative benefits and harms of second-step pharmacologic treatments for patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine attack; patients' values and preferences regarding initial pharmacologic treatments; patients' values and preferences regarding second-step pharmacologic treatments; cost-effectiveness of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients; and cost-effectiveness of second-step pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial attempt. Across these, variation by demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity) and by the presence of menstrual or menstrual (cyclical) migraine is explicitly queried for benefits/harms and for outcomes.

### Updated, web-based nutrition management guideline for PKU: an evidence and consensus based approach [^112XA7gJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for phenylketonuria, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, GMDI/SERC 2016 guidelines recommend to minimize elevation of blood phenylalanine levels during illness by treating the underlying illness, meeting protein and energy needs, and preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

### Cancer treatment research-NCI… [^113PCfvL]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment Research Combination Immunotherapy Shrank a Variety of Metastatic Solid CancersPosted: A new form of personalized cancer immunotherapy, known as tumor infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, dramatically improved the treatment's effectiveness in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers. Experimental Treatment Uses Engineered Fat Cells to "Starve" TumorsPosted: CAR T Cells: Engineering Patients' Immune Cells to Treat Their CancersUpdated: Research to improve CAR T-cell therapy is progressing rapidly. Researchers are working to expand its use to treat more types of cancer and better understand and manage its side effects. Learn how CAR T-cell therapy works, which cancers it's used to treat, and current research efforts. Scientists have been searching for ways to make immune checkpoint inhibitors work for more patients. In two trials, researchers explored a possible role for JAK inhibitors, which dampen chronic inflammation.

Immunotherapy approach shows potential in some people with metastatic solid tumorsPosted: A new cellular immunotherapy approach shrank tumors in 3 of 7 patients with metastatic colon cancer, in a small NCI clinical trial. Normal white blood cells from each patient were genetically engineered to produce receptors that recognize and attack their specific cancer cells. Immunotherapy and… Nothing Else. Studies Test Potential Paradigm Shift in Cancer TreatmentPosted: For some people with cancer, is 6 months of immunotherapy the only treatment they might ever need. Or 4 weeks of immunotherapy followed by minor surgery. Results from several small clinical trials suggest these scenarios may be bona fide possibilities. Two research teams have developed a treatment approach that could potentially enable KRAS-targeted drugs — and perhaps other targeted cancer drugs — flag cancer cells for the immune system.

In lab studies, the teams paired these targeted drugs with experimental antibody drugs that helped the immune system mount an attack. Targeting Inflammation Emerges as a Strategy for Treating CancerPosted: Dabrafenib–Trametinib Combination Approved for Solid Tumors with BRAF MutationsPosted: FDA has approved the combination of the targeted drugs dabrafenib and trametinib for nearly any type of advanced solid tumor with a specific mutation in the BRAF gene. Data from the NCI-MATCH trial informed the approval.

### Randomized controlled trials versus real world evidence: neither magic nor myth [^111H7959]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The above examples illustrate what we argue will be the inevitable future of evidence generation for many drug‐indication pairs: a combination of randomized and nonrandomized methods, drawing on a variety of data sources, with data being prospectively or retrospectively collected. In most cases, patients will need to be followed up for prolonged periods of time, especially postauthorization, to empirically confirm or refute a priori assumptions of (comparative) efficacy and safety.

Figure 1 conceptualizes the complex matrix of evidence generation defined by the following required:

breadth of information, which refers to (sub‐)populations characterized by different mutations, disease severity, comorbidity, or phenotypic patient factors,
depth of information, which refers to different efficacy and safety end points, and
context of information, which refers to a range of comparator treatments, and treatment combinations.

Figure 1
The complex matrix of research questions and methods. The graphic conceptualizes the complexities of research questions associated with a hypothetical drug treatment intended for a disease condition caused by different mutations in individual patients. Complexity is defined along three axes: the x‐axis depicts breadth of information (i.e. different patient subgroups, based on mutation, phenotype, or disease stage), the z‐axis depicts depth of information (i.e. different types of efficacy or safety end points of interest), and the y‐axis depicts context of information (i.e. different comparators or treatment combinations). Each cell in the three‐dimensional matrix represents an item of information that may be relevant for a particular decision maker and/or patient subgroup. Different study types (symbolized by different colors) will be required to generate the information, given the appropriateness of methods for different research questions as well as practical constraints on evidence generation. Note that for some research questions, there will be no data and information available at all, at least at the time of market launch. See main text for real‐life examples that fit the schematic.

Severity definitions and conditional recommendation meaning: Severe illness is defined as patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, including patients on supplemental oxygen. Critical illness is defined as patients on mechanical ventilation and ECMO, includes end organ dysfunction as is seen in sepsis/septic shock, and in COVID-19 the most commonly reported form of end organ dysfunction is ARDS. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Use of massage therapy for pain, 2018–2023: a systematic review [^1119Z66M]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Although this systematic review found that the number of conclusions about the effectiveness of massage therapy that were judged to have at least moderate certainty of evidence was greater now than in 2018, it was still small relative to the need. More high-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to provide a stronger evidence base to assess the effect of massage therapy on pain. For painful conditions that do not have at least moderate-certainty evidence supporting use of massage therapy, new studies that address limitations of existing research are needed. The field of massage therapy would be best advanced by educating the wider research community with clearer definitions of massage therapy and whether it is appropriate to include multiple modalities in the same systematic review.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^112TDj1U]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results: Baseline data

Item 15: Baseline data

Standard CONSORT — A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for each group.

CONSORT cluster extension — Baseline characteristics for the individual and cluster levels as applicable for each group.

Extension for SW-CRTs — Baseline characteristics for the individual and cluster levels as applicable for each treatment condition or allocated sequence.

Example 1 (Baseline table by treatment condition, cross-sectional design) — Supplementary materials, table S2.

Example 2 (Baseline table by allocated sequence, open cohort design) — Supplementary materials, table S3.

Explanation — In a parallel CRT, a summary of the cluster and participant level characteristics at baseline by treatment condition can allow assessment of the success of randomisation and provides a description of the included sample. In trials with post-randomisation recruitment, this table can allow an assessment of potential biases.

The term "baseline" in a SW-CRT can be confusing because of the longitudinal nature of the design. We use the term "baseline characteristic" to mean a characteristic which was either measured before exposure to the control or intervention condition, or which is not expected to be influenced by the treatment conditions (eg, age). In designs in which observations are made on different participants in each period, these baseline characteristics will often pertain to measurements made just before the switch from control to intervention condition (ie, not at the start of the trial); whereas in designs where participants are repeatedly assessed, these characteristics might be measured before randomisation. Cluster level characteristics can often be measured before randomisation and are less likely to change over time.

For SW-CRTs in which observations are made on different participants in each period, the summary of baseline characteristics could be presented by treatment condition or by allocated sequence. For example, the DAVE Trial, which measures different participants in each period, reports its baseline table by treatment condition (see supplementary materials, fig S2).

For SW-CRTs in which the same participants are repeatedly assessed in each of the periods, the baseline characteristics of participants will normally be presented by allocated sequence rather than by treatment condition. This is because most participants will be observed first under the control and then intervention condition. The Depression Management Trial (see supplementary materials, fig S3) provides summary characteristics by allocated sequence.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^112YffQa]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

### Changes in comorbid conditions after prolonged exposure for PTSD: a literature review [^116sSA12]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings are consistent with theoretical models proposing that several comorbid conditions may derive directly or indirectly from the PTSD symptoms. Therefore, directly targeting the PTSD symptoms with a trauma-focused treatment such as PE would be a logical first step in treatment. In contrast, adjunctive treatments targeted at specific secondary conditions are typically longer and may unnecessarily postpone decreases in PTSD symptoms and related comorbidity or even increase the risk of dropout before the patient arrives at the trauma-focused treatment phase. For comorbid conditions that do not seem to change during PE, such as substance abuse, integrated treatments in which the PTSD symptoms and the comorbidity are targeted at the same time are recommended (see). In addition, for comorbid conditions such as acute suicidality for which PE has not yet been evaluated as a stand-alone treatment, it is recommended to use an integrated treatment that focuses on stabilizing suicidality prior to starting trauma-focused treatment and continues to monitor and target suicidality as needed during PE (e.g.). Future research should be aimed at directly comparing phase-oriented treatments to PE-alone or integrated treatments. Also, a reverse phase-oriented treatment may be considered in which PTSD symptoms are targeted in the first phase and remaining comorbid symptoms are addressed in the second phase.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### Treatment of chronic non-cancer pain [^115QrLJe]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic pain is a pervasive problem that affects the patient, their significant others, and society in many ways. The past decade has seen advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain and in the availability of technically advanced diagnostic procedures; however, the most notable therapeutic changes have not been the development of novel evidenced-based methods, but rather changing trends in applications and practices within the available clinical armamentarium. We provide a general overview of empirical evidence for the most commonly used interventions in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, including pharmacological, interventional, physical, psychological, rehabilitative, and alternative modalities. Overall, currently available treatments provide modest improvements in pain and minimum improvements in physical and emotional functioning. The quality of evidence is mediocre and has not improved substantially during the past decade. There is a crucial need for assessment of combination treatments, identification of indicators of treatment response, and assessment of the benefit of matching of treatments to patient characteristics.

### Running interferon interference in treating PV / ET: meeting unmet needs [^1172vDQY]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Enthusiasm about interferons for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms has recently arisen. How does a nontargeted therapy selectively target the malignant clone? Many foundational questions about interferon treatment are unanswered, including who, when, and for how long do we treat. Using an individual case, this review touches on gaps in risk assessment in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) and the history of treatment with interferons. How is it that this proinflammatory cytokine effectively treats ET and PV, themselves proinflammatory states? We summarize existing mechanistic and clinical data, the molecular context as a modifier for treatment response, the establishment of treatment goals, and the challenges that lie ahead.

### A systematic literature review of the assessment of treatment burden experienced by patients and their caregivers [^114dbjH7]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a systematic literature review to identify articles assessing the treatment burden experienced by patients and caregivers to inform the feasibility of developing a quality indicator in this area for home-based medical care. We found no guidelines for healthcare professionals on when to assess for treatment burden and identified no one standardized assessment method. Qualitative data outlined the complexity of treatment burden as not just the burden of using a specific treatment, but all the adaptations and changes that need to be made to an individual's daily life in order to successfully use a particular treatment. Very little data about caregiver treatment burden were identified.

Many instruments are available to assess treatment burden. Little or no work has been done to assess or compare the performance properties of the different instruments, so deciding which one to use is largely dependent on the number of comorbid conditions, the nature of the conditions and the time available for administration. Most currently available tools are disease-specific but have the potential to be adapted to other disease states, such as the Treatment Well-Being component of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). As the majority of older adults now live with more than one condition finding a useful tool to assess the burden of treatment in those living with multiple chronic conditions such as the Multimorbidity Treatment Burden Questionnaire becomes increasingly important.

### Definitions of chronic disease need to be more patient centred [^111VsFBM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Effect on patients

Another important consequence of defining an abnormal test or examination result as disease is that patients will lose, and in fact have often already lost, their say in whether they are sick, whether they need a treatment, and whether the treatment is effective. This loss is of no small matter. As a result, their health and rights cannot be adequately protected partly because of the competing interests of other stakeholders in the business of healthcare. Furthermore, interventions cannot make patients truly satisfied if they cannot sense what is wrong with their body and the benefit of interventions on it. Lastly, making small abnormal changes a disease may also increase overdiagnoses, cause health inequity, and compromise care quality and safety. Even the best evidence based policies will fail if clinicians do not have sufficient time to follow them, not to say the unsubstantiated recommendations, as clinicians have already been overloaded.

It is now evident that disease is not a black and white entity and ever earlier or smaller forms always exist. Undoubtedly, health technology will continue to advance so that in the future we can see even smaller changes in the body. Early detection and treatment are certainly beneficial for many diseases. The question is whether we should make a small abnormality a disease for which early diagnosis has little or no benefit and how much further we should go in this direction. Given the widely existent overdiagnosis and ever increasing health expenditure, we argue, for the purpose of patient care that is medicine's fundamental goal, we should rethink the way we define chronic diseases and make early, small abnormal changes a disease only if there are effective interventions that can make a clinical difference that is worthwhile to patients. To this end, the interventions' absolute benefit and cost effectiveness in the newly labelled patients should be highly emphasised and carefully evaluated before changing a diagnostic cut-off point or modifying a disease definition.

### Imiquimod [^111mcZDJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.

Especially tell your healthcare provider if you have had other treatments for genital warts or warts around your anus, or actinic keratosis, or superficial basal cell carcinoma. Imiquimod Cream should not be used until your skin has healed from other treatments. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I use Imiquimod Cream?

- Do not get Imiquimod Cream in or near your mouth, eyes, nose or vagina.

- Use Imiquimod Cream exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. Your healthcare provider will tell you where to apply Imiquimod Cream and how often and for how long to apply it for your condition.

- Imiquimod Cream is used for different skin conditions. Use Imiquimod Cream only on the area of your body to be treated. Do not apply Imiquimod Cream to other areas.

- Do not use Imiquimod Cream longer than prescribed. Using too much Imiquimod Cream, or using it too often, or for too long can increase your chances for having a severe skin reaction or other side effect.

### Risk and prevention of fracture in patients with major medical illnesses: a mini-review [^115L3M4j]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with several medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, recent stroke, HIV, and heart failure, have a high risk of hip fracture. These patients will also have more severe consequences of a hip fracture, including a greater chance of dying and more prolonged disability. Together, there are nearly as many patients with medical conditions that substantially increase the risk of hip fracture as there are people with osteoporosis by femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD). The contributions of falling and decreased bone mass to the increased risks with these conditions are not certain. Although there are few data about whether and what type of treatments these patients receive to prevent fracture, it is likely that few receive pharmacologic treatments that have been shown to reduce the risk of hip fracture. There is a need to show that drug treatments that strengthen bone also reduce fracture risk in patients whose risk may be owing in greater part to traumatic falls than osteoporosis. Assuming that treatments are efficacious in these patients, there is a major opportunity to substantially reduce the incidence and consequences of hip fracture by reaching more of them with drug treatments to reduce the risk of hip fracture. This will require engagement of specialists who have little expertise and perhaps limited interest in preventing fractures, or new approaches to delivering drug treatments to prevent fracture directly to the patients at risk. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### The complexity underlying treatment rankings: how to use them and what to look at… [^117HGCCw]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

If obtaining a treatment hierarchy is one of the aims of the synthesis, we recommend reviewers to specify the treatment hierarchy question a priori in the protocol, together with the appropriate ranking metric to answer that treatment hierarchy question. This is the first step to avoid misinterpreting the findings of the chosen ranking. The presented treatment hierarchy must be interpreted together with the relative treatment effects, with particular attention to the uncertainty in the estimations, as well as the quality of the synthesised evidence. More work focusing on the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the confidence in the rankings of treatments is needed.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — ambulatory persons: The panel states the overall certainty is low and notes uncertainty about early use, and the guideline panel suggests use only in a narrow outpatient population. Specifically, the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence is low due to concerns with imprecision and recognized the inability to exclude a meaningful beneficial or detrimental effect when convalescent plasma is given early in the course of COVID-19 disease. For outpatients, the guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the ambulatory setting for persons with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, who have no other treatment options.

### Case-based considerations in the treatment of actinic keratoses: utilizing combination or sequential therapy with 5-fluorouracil cream and destructive treatments [^116wamWZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Dermatologic conditions associated with prolonged sun exposure represent a substantial portion of visits to the dermatologist's office, particularly among elderly populations. Actinic keratoses are premalignant lesions that increase in frequency with each decade of life and have the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Non-melanoma skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, also represent sun-related conditions that require early and aggressive treatment. Therapeutic options for these conditions are abundant and range from topical field-directed therapies to destructive, lesion-directed procedures. Choice of therapy depends on the types and extent of lesions with which a patient presents; often, a combination of treatments provides the optimal means for successful outcomes. The following case-based review represents typical situations where multiple treatments were combined to manage actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in patients over an extended treatment period.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^117M8Q9Z]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Appendix I: Glossary — key definitions in palliative care include the following. Serious illness is defined as a "health condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either negatively impacts a person's daily function or quality of life or excessively strains their caregiver". Shared decision-making is described as "an interpersonal, interdependent process in which the health care provider and the patient relate to and influence each other as they collaborate in making decisions about the patient's health care", and "Three essential elements must be present for shared decision making to occur. First, both the health care provider and the patient must recognize and acknowledge that a decision is, in fact, required. Second, they must both know and understand the best available evidence concerning the risks and benefits of each option. Third, decisions must take into account both the provider's guidance and the patient's values and preferences". Social determinants of health are defined as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age", and are "mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries". Specialist palliative care is "the active, total care of patients with serious illness and their families", and "Care is provided by an interdisciplinary team whose members have undergone recognized specialist palliative care training". Spirituality "is the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred". Spiritual assessment is "a more extensive process of active listening to a patient's story conducted by a board-certified chaplain that summarizes the needs and resources that emerge in that process", with "a spiritual care plan with expected outcomes that is then communicated to the rest of the treatment team", and "should be done only by a board-certified chaplain or an equivalently prepared spiritual care provider". Spiritual distress is defined as "a state of suffering related to the impaired ability to experience meaning in life through connectedness with self, others, world or a Superior Being", including attributes such as "suffering, impaired spirituality, contrary to spiritual well- being, and related to meaning in life".

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^111PT6aC]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — integrated care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) emphasizes that "COPD, as a chronic, complex illness with multiple systemic effects and co-morbidities, requires an integrated approach for its optimal management", defining integrated care as "a continuum of patient-centered services organized as a care delivery value chain for patients with chronic conditions with the goal of achieving the optimal daily functioning and health status for the individual patient and to achieve and maintain the individual's independence and functioning in the community". The chronic care model "provides a template for integrating care, by encompassing six key components: self- management support, clinical information systems, delivery system redesign, decision support (guidelines), healthcare organization, and community resources". The report notes limitations of disease-specific guidance as "Disease-specific clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) often fall short in patients with multiple morbidities and trying to implement several disease-specific CPGs can pose an onerous treatment burden and increase the risk of adverse drug events", and highlights the evidence gap that "evidence-based literature specifically pertaining to the complex patient with COPD is still early in development". The workshop discussion indicates contextual tailoring, stating "one size will not fit all", and adds a goal "to: (1) highlight the problems associated with the care of the complex patient with COPD".

### Acupuncture… [^11712rLJ]. NCI (2006). Low credibility.

Acupuncture –Patient Version OverviewGo to Health Professional Version
- Acupuncture applies needles, heat, pressure, and other treatments to one or more places on the skin known as acupuncture points.
- Clinical trials report that acupuncture relieves nausea and vomiting from anticancer therapies.
- Other trials have studied the use of acupuncture in cancer treatment to relieve symptoms such as fatigue, dry mouth, and hot flashes.
- A strict clean needle method must be used when acupuncture treatment is given to people with cancer. The current standard of care for CIPN is symptom management such as narcotics and antidepressants. However, treatment may not relieve all of the pain, and it can cause dizziness, sedation, dry mouth, and constipation. Some randomized clinical trials of acupuncture have shown promise in treating CIPN.

More evidence is needed to explore how acupuncture may relieve symptoms of CIPN and to find out which people may benefit most from acupuncture. For more information about these studies, see the Acupuncture to treat persistent CIPN from taxane or platinum-based chemotherapy section of the health professional version of Acupuncture. One phase III clinical trial with sites in the United States and China studied 339 people with head and neck cancer who received true acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or standard care while receiving radiation therapy. Acupuncture was given three times per week during a 6- to 7-week course of radiation therapy. The dry mouth score reduction at 1 year was greater in the true acupuncture group than in the standard care group, but only slightly different from the sham acupuncture group. An additional phase III clinical trial is in progress to study the role of acupuncture for the treatment of dry mouth in people with head and neck cancer.

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine — also called integrative medicine — includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.

Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in children — clinical presentation and risk factors: Case and hospitalization rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are lower than in adults, and asymptomatic infection is more common; however, infection can lead to significant illness and even death in children. Clinical presentations can be non-specific and may more frequently include fever alone and/or gastrointestinal symptoms than in adults, and children are also capable of transmitting disease to others. Comorbidities including medically complex conditions (including certain genetic disorders, neurologic diseases, and cancer), type 1 diabetes, complex congenital heart disease, and obesity have all been associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and ICU admission in children.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^116e9edg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

### Rigorous control conditions diminish treatment effects in weight loss-randomized controlled trials [^114kYmd7]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It has not been established whether control conditions with large weight losses (WLs) diminish expected treatment effects in WL or prevention of weight gain (PWG)-randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Subjects/Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of 239 WL/PWG RCTs that include a control group and at least one treatment group. A maximum likelihood meta-analysis framework was used to model and understand the relationship between treatment effects and control group outcomes.

Results

Under the informed model, an increase in control group WL of 1kg corresponds with an expected shrinkage of the treatment effect by 0.309kg (95% confidence interval (-0.480, -0.138), P = 0.00081); this result is robust against violations of the model assumptions.

Conclusions

We find that control conditions with large WLs diminish expected treatment effects. Our investigation may be helpful to clinicians as they design future WL/PWG studies.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1132YYap]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up triage should help decide: i) whether to offer an in-person as opposed to a remote (telephone or virtual/online) consultation, and ii) who to prioritize. Remote follow-up could be considered when the patient or caregiver can understand the process and provide information clearly, when this is a regular COPD follow-up or the patient is followed for a known condition, when medical records and laboratory test results are accessible to the healthcare professionals, and when prescription and access to medication is possible and follow-up to the prescription can be arranged if necessary. In-person follow-up should be prioritized when the patient and caregiver have difficulty providing information, when the patient needs immediate attention due to the presence of severe medical symptoms, when changes in the patient's symptoms require a differential diagnosis work-up with the need for a physical exam and/or laboratory testing, or when patient treatment can only be given in person and cannot be given at home. Prioritization of in-person visits should take into consideration the COPD patient disease severity (symptom burden and risk of exacerbations), recent emergency department visit and/or hospital admission, associated significant comorbidities, age, and/or living alone at home.

### Prednisone [^115gkKx5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Nonoperative treatment of dupuytren's disease [^116pXjm7]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Many approaches to nonoperative treatment of Dupuytren's disease have been tried since the disease was originally described in 1831, and most have been abandoned. Nonetheless, the appeal for nonoperative methods persists, in pursuit of lower morbidity and lesser complications than may be encountered with open surgical treatment. A number of nonoperative treatment modalities are in current use for Dupuytren's disease, despite lack of high-level clinical studies supporting these methods. Some of these can be utilized as an adjunct to surgical treatment rather than a replacement for it. The most commonly used nonoperative treatment methods are briefly reviewed.

### Promising targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [^112nPR7E]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Genetics and pathology have proven to be an effective combination to identify an evolving and deepening landscape of pathways and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases. Initially this landscape appeared to be populated with distinct therapeutic targets but with potentially overlapping mechanisms in each neurodegenerative disease. Our understanding has expanded to recognize that multiple pathologies are common in neurodegenerative disease, and that there is considerable overlap in pathways and targets driving neurodegenerative diseases. This potentially opens the way for future treatments to be indicated by tissue pathology and genetic basis rather than clinical phenotype. The potential to treat neurodegenerative disease by addressing underlying pathophysiology is still in the early days and challenges remain, especially the likely need to address pathologies early in disease. This will require redefinition of diagnosis and the tools to enable earlier diagnosis.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^111qm5Tz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^113vGfCJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Influenza antiviral treatment in children with HIV includes that antiviral treatment "be given without waiting for confirmatory laboratory testing and without regard to illness duration (strong, moderate)", and "may provide benefit when started after 48 hours of illness onset in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients (weak, low)". In the outpatient setting, "Children with HIV in the outpatient setting with laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected influenza should receive antiviral treatment as soon as possible (strong, moderate)", and "Treatment should be initiated as early as possible regardless of influenza vaccine status and regardless of illness severity according to CDC/ACIP and IDSA guidelines". Also in the outpatient setting, "consideration could be given to withholding treatment if symptom duration exceeds 48 hours, the child has no HIV viremia or evidence of immunosuppression, is aged > 5 years, and has no other underlying condition that places the child at high risk of complications from influenza (weak, low)". Evidence context states that "No antiviral treatment studies have been specifically performed in children with HIV with influenza", that "The recommendations are made with reference to current influenza chemoprophylaxis and treatment guidelines published by CDC/ACIP, IDSA, and AAP", and that "Further information regarding antiviral treatment can be found at Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians".

Colchicine — ambulatory persons with COVID-19: The guideline panel made a conditional recommendation against treatment of COVID-19 with colchicine for ambulatory persons, and the guideline panel suggests against colchicine for the treatment of ambulatory persons with COVID-19. One study reported on serious adverse events among persons treated with colchicine rather than no colchicine for COVID-19, and serious adverse events may be less frequent among ambulatory persons receiving treatment with colchicine rather than no colchicine; however, this may not be meaningfully different from those not receiving colchicine (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.00). The panel determined the certainty of the evidence of treatment of colchicine for ambulatory persons to be moderate due to imprecision.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^113Nvwf4]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Treatment planning and levels of care using the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria — the ASAM criteria are the most widely used and comprehensive set of guidelines for determining treatment setting, continued stay, and transfer/discharge for patients with SUD and co-occurring conditions. After assessment, they are used to determine the level of care across the continuum of substance use treatment options such as medically managed inpatient care, partial hospital programs (PHP), residential services, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), and outpatient services (OPS), and encourage patient-centered, holistic treatment services to meet the diverse needs of each patient. The framework comprises 6 dimensions and ratings guide adolescent levels of treatment as follows: Level 1, OPS; Level 2, PHP or IOP; Level 3, residential/inpatient; and Level 4, intensive inpatient. The ASAM criteria also advocate for initial assessment, longitudinal monitoring of progress, treatment response, and movement across different levels of services.

### Understanding the context of health for persons with multiple chronic conditions: moving from what is the matter to what matters [^115bKF51]. Annals of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

An isolated focus on 1 disease at a time is insufficient to generate the scientific evidence needed to improve the health of persons living with more than 1 chronic condition. This article explores how to bring context into research efforts to improve the health of persons living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC).

Methods

Forty-five experts, including persons with MCC, family and friend caregivers, researchers, policy makers, funders, and clinicians met to critically consider 4 aspects of incorporating context into research on MCC: key contextual factors, needed research, essential research methods for understanding important contextual factors, and necessary partnerships for catalyzing collaborative action in conducting and applying research.

Results

Key contextual factors involve complementary perspectives across multiple levels: public policy, community, health care systems, family, and person, as well as the cellular and molecular levels where most research currently is focused. Needed research involves moving from a disease focus toward a person-driven, goal-directed research agenda. Relevant research methods are participatory, flexible, multilevel, quantitative and qualitative, conducive to longitudinal dynamic measurement from diverse data sources, sufficiently detailed to consider what works for whom in which situation, and generative of ongoing communities of learning, living and practice. Important partnerships for collaborative action include cooperation among members of the research enterprise, health care providers, community-based support, persons with MCC and their family and friend caregivers, policy makers, and payers, including government, public health, philanthropic organizations, and the business community.

Conclusion

Consistent attention to contextual factors is needed to enhance health research for persons with MCC. Rigorous, integrated, participatory, multimethod approaches to generate new knowledge and diverse partnerships can be used to increase the relevance of research to make health care more sustainable, safe, equitable and effective, to reduce suffering, and to improve quality of life.

### Delirium in older persons: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^113niKWL]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on delirium:

- **Definition**: Delirium is an acute, usually reversible confusional state that results from an organic disorder and encompasses changes in attention, cognition and consciousness.
- **Pathophysiology**: Delirium results from a complex interplay between predisposing host factors (dementia, cognitive impairment, depression, medical comorbidities, functional impairment, older age, alcohol abuse, previous history of delirium or stroke), and precipitating external factors (medications, laboratory abnormalities, infections, surgeries).
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of delirium in the emergency department, hospital setting, and ICU setting ranges from 8–10%, 11–25%, and 20–80%, respectively. The overall incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients is 29–31%. In post-operative patients and ICU patients, the incidence ranges from 12–51%, and 22–83%, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Predisposing factors include dementia, cognitive impairment, history of delirium, functional impairment, vision impairment, hearing impairment, severity of illness, depression, history of stroke, alcohol abuse, and older age. Precipitating factors include electrolyte abnormalities, polypharmacy, specific medications (sedatives, anticholinergics), surgery, infections, and the use of physical restraints.
- **Disease course**: Resultant disruption of neuronal networks leads to cognitive impairment, behavioral disturbances, altered consciousness, inattention, agitation, coma, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Delirium is associated with a 39% cumulative one-year mortality.

### Genetic medicines: treatment strategies for hereditary disorders [^116YtNMp]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

The treatment of the more than 1,800 known monogenic hereditary disorders will depend on the development of 'genetic medicines' - therapies that use the transfer of DNA and/or RNA to modify gene expression to correct or compensate for an abnormal phenotype. Strategies include the use of somatic stem cells, gene transfer, RNA modification and, in the future, embryonic stem cells. Despite the efficacy of these technologies in treating experimental models of hereditary disorders, applying them successfully in the clinic is a great challenge, which will only be overcome by expending considerable intellectual and economic resources, and by solving societal concerns about modifications of the human genetic repertoire.

### Guidelines for biomarkers in autoimmune rheumatic diseases-evidence based analysis [^114DivS9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are characterised by an abnormal immune system response, complement activation, cytokines dysregulation and inflammation. In last years, despite many progresses in managing these patients, it has been shown that clinical remission is reached in less than 50% of patients and a personalised and tailored therapeutic approach is still lacking resulting in a significant gap between guidelines and real-world practice. In this context, the need for biomarkers facilitating early diagnosis and profiling those individuals at the highest risk for a poor outcome has become of crucial interest. A biomarker generally refers to a measured characteristic which may be used as an indicator of some biological state or condition. Three different types of medical biomarkers has been suggested: i. mechanistic markers; ii. clinical disease markers; iii. therapeutic markers. A combination of biomarkers from these different groups could be used for an ideal more accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, although a growing body of evidence is focused on improving biomarkers, a significant amount of this information is not integrated on standard clinical care. The overarching aim of this work was to clarify the meaning of specific biomarkers during autoimmune diseases; their possible role in confirming diagnosis, predicting outcome and suggesting specific treatments.

Microscopic colitis — AGA Recommendation 5 (prednisone/prednisolone): Recommendation 5. In patients with symptomatic microscopic colitis in whom budesonide therapy is not feasible, the AGA suggests treatment with prednisone (or prednisolone) over no treatment for the induction of clinical remission. Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence. Although in most cases it should not be used as first-line therapy, there may be circumstances in which it may be the preferred agent; Prednisolone may be considered in patients who have refractory symptoms after treatment with budesonide and when other coexisting etiologies such as celiac disease have been excluded, and because prednisolone is considerably less expensive than budesonide, it may be an alternative choice when the cost of the latter is prohibitive.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^112wTchj]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis is the traditional basis for decision-making in clinical practice. Evidence is often lacking about future benefits and harms of these decisions for patients diagnosed with and without disease. We propose that a model of clinical practice focused on patient prognosis and predicting the likelihood of future outcomes may be more useful.

Discussion

Disease diagnosis can provide crucial information for clinical decisions that influence outcome in serious acute illness. However, the central role of diagnosis in clinical practice is challenged by evidence that it does not always benefit patients and that factors other than disease are important in determining patient outcome. The concept of disease as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' is challenged by the frequent use of diagnostic indicators with continuous distributions, such as blood sugar, which are better understood as contributing information about the probability of a patient's future outcome. Moreover, many illnesses, such as chronic fatigue, cannot usefully be labelled from a disease-diagnosis perspective. In such cases, a prognostic model provides an alternative framework for clinical practice that extends beyond disease and diagnosis and incorporates a wide range of information to predict future patient outcomes and to guide decisions to improve them. Such information embraces non-disease factors and genetic and other biomarkers which influence outcome.

Summary

Patient prognosis can provide the framework for modern clinical practice to integrate information from the expanding biological, social, and clinical database for more effective and efficient care.
