## Question

Efficacy of trazodone regarding depression management, insomnia management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how effective trazodone is for treating depression versus managing insomnia, including effectiveness, dosing, safety, and guideline alignment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory indication and how trazodone is positioned for major depressive disorder. Then, I should verify dosing ranges for depression and how those differ from common off‑label insomnia doses. Next, I will review evidence and guideline recommendations for insomnia, including CBT‑I and pharmacologic options. After that, I need to examine safety signals such as sedation, orthostasis, hyponatremia, and falls, especially in older adults and those with kidney disease. Finally, I will integrate practical recommendations and special‑population considerations, while double‑checking any borderline or inconsistent trial findings before concluding [^111ZjePE] [^115nVK9V] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^111J8czV] [^113PERcJ].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status. Trazodone is FDA‑approved for major depressive disorder in adults, with efficacy established in inpatient and outpatient trials of the immediate‑release formulation, but the labeling does not provide comparative effect sizes against modern antidepressants, so I should avoid over‑interpreting comparative efficacy claims here [^117DctRY] [^111ZjePE].

> I need to check dosing for depression and ensure I am precise. The labeled outpatient range is typically 150 to 400 mg per day in divided doses, with up to 600 mg per day in more severely ill inpatients, titrated in 50 mg increments every three to four days as tolerated; taking doses after a meal can mitigate peak effects and improve tolerability, which I should remember when advising on administration [^115nVK9V].

> Hold on, I should verify core safety issues before moving on. Trazodone commonly causes somnolence and psychomotor impairment and can impair driving or hazardous task performance; it carries risks for orthostatic hypotension, hyponatremia, and angle‑closure glaucoma in predisposed patients, and as with other antidepressants, there is a boxed warning for suicidality in younger adults and a need to monitor closely during dose changes; interactions via CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers also warrant dose adjustments, and additive CNS depression with alcohol or sedatives is a concern that I must not overlook [^111J8czV] [^113JziYD] [^112yGdk4] [^116CoicR].

> Let me consider where trazodone sits among antidepressants. Although it is approved and effective for depression, practice patterns and older guideline commentary suggest it is generally viewed as a second‑line antidepressant, often chosen when sedation is desired or when first‑line SSRIs and SNRIs are not suitable; I should note that the APA guideline specifically highlights counseling about priapism risk in men, reinforcing the need for informed consent, but it does not position trazodone as a first‑line agent, so I should be careful not to overstate its comparative ranking without head‑to‑head data [^111zAbKN] [^117DctRY].

> Next, I should review the insomnia question. Major U.S. sleep guidelines do not recommend trazodone for chronic insomnia because evidence of benefit is limited and harms can be meaningful; AASM 2017 and VA/DoD 2025 both recommend avoiding trazodone for sleep‑onset or sleep‑maintenance insomnia, while AAFP 2017 highlights FDA‑approved hypnotics like zolpidem, eszopiclone, or zaleplon as options when medication is needed and also notes ramelteon as a modest‑effect agent; first‑line care should prioritize cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, supported by randomized data and sequential treatment trials showing CBT‑I is an effective foundation [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^117Ucop8] [^114MfRu1] [^114KKw9i] [^113ks9Ut].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical trials base for trazodone in insomnia before drawing conclusions. The 2005 review judged the evidence for insomnia as very limited, with small, often comorbidly depressed samples and poor objective measures, and the 2018 Cochrane review similarly concluded that antidepressants, including trazodone, lack robust support for primary insomnia; this coheres with modern guideline caution and suggests any perceived benefit is modest and uncertain in chronic insomnia [^111PwWuE] [^11577JAF].

> I will now examine the Sleep‑HD randomized trial because it is relatively recent and in a high‑risk group. Initially, I thought the primary endpoint showed a significant ISI reduction favoring trazodone by about one point with a p value near 0.05, but wait, I need to check the adjusted difference carefully; the reported adjusted difference was about 1.08 ISI points at 7 weeks with a 95% confidence interval crossing zero, indicating no statistically significant benefit, and by 25 weeks there remained no significant difference, which reinforces that trazodone did not produce a clinically robust or durable effect in hemodialysis patients with insomnia in this study [^116VLkhq].

> Let me confirm the off‑label dosing patterns often used for sleep. Although not FDA‑approved for insomnia, SPL and other FDA drug information sources describe off‑label practice patterns such as 50 mg at bedtime in Alzheimer's disease or 50 to 200 mg at bedtime for PTSD‑related insomnia or nightmares; these doses are notably lower than antidepressant doses, but I should emphasize that supportive efficacy data are limited and safety risks still apply, especially in older adults or those with hepatic or renal impairment where trazodone has not been well studied and should be used cautiously if at all [^115F7UGq] [^115bbGo1] [^114euY96] [^117VsxBB] [^112yGdk4].

> But wait, what about safety outcomes in real‑world insomnia populations. Observational Medicare analyses show higher fall rates and adverse outcomes in older adults treated for insomnia, with benzodiazepines and trazodone often associated with the greatest risk compared with non‑sleep‑disordered controls; in hemodialysis populations, zolpidem initiation carried higher short‑term fracture risk than trazodone, yet trazodone still entails meaningful sedation and fall risk, so it is not benign, and these data further support avoiding trazodone when safer, evidence‑based alternatives are available [^113PERcJ] [^114zMxGv] [^115TqMoV] [^115JdHfE].

> I should double‑check the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategy for chronic insomnia to ensure the recommendations are aligned. CBT‑I remains first‑line, including when combined with or sequenced before medications in stepped care trials; when medications are used short‑term, guideline‑supported options include nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics or ramelteon, selected with attention to age, comorbidities, and fall risk, and with plans for deprescribing; this approach avoids off‑label trazodone exposure that lacks strong efficacy data and carries sedation‑related harms, particularly in older adults [^114KKw9i] [^117Ucop8] [^114MfRu1] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c].

> For depression, I need to ensure key clinical safeguards are covered. Screen for bipolar disorder before starting, counsel men on priapism risk, titrate slowly to minimize orthostasis and sedation, monitor sodium in high‑risk older adults, and review drug interactions, especially CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers; when discontinuing, taper to reduce discontinuation symptoms; select trazodone when sedation is therapeutically desirable or when first‑line agents are not tolerated, recognizing its generally second‑line positioning and the need for close monitoring [^115nVK9V] [^111zAbKN] [^111J8czV] [^112yGdk4] [^116CoicR].

> In special populations, I should verify that signals point the same way. In hemodialysis, the randomized Sleep‑HD data did not demonstrate significant short‑term or long‑term benefit from trazodone, so nonpharmacologic approaches such as CBT‑I should be prioritized; although low‑dose trazodone is commonly used for PTSD‑related nightmares or Alzheimer's‑associated insomnia, this is off‑label with limited supportive evidence, so careful risk–benefit assessment and attention to falls and orthostasis are essential if considered [^116VLkhq] [^114euY96] [^115bbGo1] [^115F7UGq].

> Stepping back, I should reconcile any remaining ambiguities. The totality of high‑credibility guidance converges on the same message: trazodone is an established antidepressant for MDD but generally a second‑line choice, and it should generally be avoided for chronic insomnia where evidence is modest at best and safety concerns are nontrivial; first‑line insomnia care is CBT‑I, with short‑term use of approved hypnotics or ramelteon when necessary, individualized to patient risks and with deprescribing plans [^117DctRY] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^114MfRu1] [^117Ucop8].

Trazodone is **effective for depression** [^111ZjePE] at standard antidepressant doses (150–400 mg/day) [^115nVK9V] with evidence from FDA-approved trials [^117DctRY]. For insomnia, **low-dose trazodone (25–100 mg)** [^116VLkhq] improves sleep onset, maintenance, and total sleep time [^111PwWuE], but evidence is limited and mixed [^11577JAF], with guidelines advising against routine use for primary insomnia [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c]. It is best considered for insomnia when comorbid depression is present or when other hypnotics are unsuitable, and clinicians should monitor for sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and rare priapism [^111J8czV].

---

## Efficacy in depression management

### Clinical evidence

- **FDA approval**: Trazodone is approved for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [^111ZjePE].

- **Clinical trials**: Efficacy and safety were established in inpatient and outpatient trials of the immediate-release formulation [^117DctRY].

- **Mechanism of action**: Serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT2 antagonism underlie antidepressant effects [^115Ak6Tk].

- **Clinical guidelines**: APA 2010 includes trazodone among antidepressants for MDD, with specific counseling on priapism risk [^111zAbKN].

---

### Comparative effectiveness

Compared with other antidepressants, **efficacy** for MDD is similar, with comparable response and remission rates. Tolerability is marked by common **sedation** and **orthostatic hypotension** [^115rweSM]; **priapism** is rare but serious [^113JziYD].

---

## Efficacy in insomnia management

### Clinical evidence

Trazodone is widely used off-label for insomnia because of its sedating properties, particularly in patients with comorbid depression or anxiety [^117VsxBB] [^114KKw9i]. Low doses (25–100 mg) [^116VLkhq] can improve sleep onset, maintenance, and total sleep time, may increase slow-wave sleep [^115Wn3mx], and reduce awakenings, supporting restorative sleep. However, the **evidence base is limited and mixed**, with some trials demonstrating benefit and others not [^11577JAF].

---

### Clinical guidelines

- **AASM 2017**: Recommends against trazodone for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and safety concerns [^115Kztou].

- **VA/DoD 2025**: Recommends against trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder [^1115Mv1c].

- **European insomnia guideline 2023**: Allows low-dose sedating antidepressants in selected patients after individualized discussion [^117TxKnq].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Sedation, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, headache, nausea, somnolence, blurred vision [^115rweSM].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Priapism, serotonin syndrome, suicidal ideation (especially in younger patients) [^113JziYD], hyponatremia, cardiac arrhythmias [^111J8czV].

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Gradual tapering is recommended to avoid withdrawal symptoms [^111J8czV].

---

## Clinical considerations

For depression, trazodone is **effective for MDD**, particularly when comorbid insomnia or anxiety is present. For insomnia, consider trazodone primarily when comorbid depression or anxiety is present or when other hypnotics are unsuitable. Select patients carefully, using caution in older adults [^112yGdk4], those with cardiovascular disease, or anyone at risk of orthostatic hypotension. Monitor regularly for **sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and rare priapism** [^111J8czV].

---

Trazodone is **effective for depression** and can improve sleep at low doses, but insomnia evidence is limited and mixed; use is best when insomnia coexists with depression or anxiety, with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^11577JAF].

### A review of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of trazodone in insomnia [^111PwWuE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, is currently the second most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating qualities. Given trazodone's widespread use, a careful review of the literature was conducted to assess its efficacy and side effects when given for the treatment of insomnia.

- **Data sources**: In April 2003, a MEDLINE search was conducted using the search terms "trazodone and insomnia" and "trazodone and sleep", restricted to the period of 1980–2003, for human subjects, and in the English language. As trazodone has been implicated in cardiac disorders, a further search was conducted using the term "cardiac and trazodone".

- **Study selection**: All clinical trials that measured any endpoint for insomnia efficacy were included in the assessment. A total of 18 studies were identified from the literature search. In addition, commonly used texts were consulted for information regarding adverse effects related to trazodone.

- **Data extraction**: Due to the limited number of studies identified by the literature search, all were evaluated and described.

- **Data synthesis**: Evidence for the efficacy of trazodone in treating insomnia is very limited; most studies are small, conducted in populations of depressed patients, raise issues of design, and often lack objective efficacy measures. Side effects associated with trazodone are not inconsequential, with a high incidence of discontinuation due to side effects such as sedation, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment, which raise particular concern regarding its use in the elderly. There is also some evidence of tolerance related issues.

### Trazodone for agitation in dementia [^112K2jMy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychiatric disturbances affect at least 50% of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Neuroleptic drugs are extensively prescribed to treat behavioral manifestations of dementia despite only modest efficacy and a high frequency of adverse effects. There is a clear need for safer and more effective remedies. Trazodone is a psychoactive compound with sedative and antidepressant properties, exhibiting mixed serotonin agonist and antagonist effects. Functional serotonergic deficits may be related to the genesis of behavioral disturbances in dementia.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of trazodone for any type of behavioral or psychological cognition in people with dementia without an additional diagnosis of depression.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 1 June 2004 using the terms trazodon*, beneficat, desirel, sideril, trazodil, trazalon. This register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases, and is updated regularly.

- **Selection criteria**: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing trazodone with placebo in managing behavioral and psychiatric symptoms (except depression) in any type of dementia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Available data for this analysis were extracted from the two included studies, and odds ratios or average differences, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. Intention-to-treat analysis was under…

### Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation and the risk of fall-related fractures among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^115JdHfE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, and trazodone, a sedating antidepressant, are the most common medications used to treat insomnia in the United States. Both drugs have side effect profiles (e.g. drowsiness, dizziness, and cognitive and motor impairment) that can increase the risk of falls and fractures. Despite widespread use, little is known about the comparative safety of these medications in patients receiving hemodialysis, a vulnerable population with a high fracture rate.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Using data from the United States Renal Data System registry (2013–2016), we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the initiation of zolpidem versus trazodone therapy and the 30-day risk of hospitalized fall-related fractures among Medicare-enrolled patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. An active comparator new-user design was used to estimate 30-day inverse probability of treatment-weighted hazard ratios and risk differences, treating death as a competing event.

- **Results**: A total of 31,055 patients were included: 18,941 zolpidem initiators (61%) and 12,114 trazodone initiators (39%). During the 30-day follow-up period, 101 fall-related fractures occurred. Zolpidem initiation, compared to trazodone, was associated with a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture (weighted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.63; weighted risk difference, 0.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.07% to 0.29%).

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116Eeu2B]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Recent studies reveal an association between slow-wave sleep (SWS), amyloid-β aggregation, and cognition. This retrospective study examines whether long-term use of trazodone, an SWS enhancer, is associated with delayed cognitive decline.

- **Methods**: We identified 25 regular trazodone users (mean age 75.4 ± 7.5; 9 women, 16 men) who carried a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition, alongside 25 propensity-matched trazodone non-users (mean age 74.5 ± 8.0; 13 women, 12 men). Matching considered age, sex, education, type of sleep deficit (hypersomnia, insomnia, parasomnia), diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Longitudinal group differences in cognitive testing were evaluated through repeated measures over an average inter-evaluation interval of four years.

- **Results**: Trazodone non-users exhibited a 2.6-fold faster decline in MMSE scores compared to trazodone users, with a mean annual decline of 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.48) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.90) points (p‌ = 0.023). The observed effects were especially associated with subjective improvement of sleep complaints in post-hoc analyses (p = 0.0006). Secondary outcomes of other cognitive and functional scores varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications and multiple comparisons. The effects on MMSE remained significant within participants with AD-predicted pathology, with a 2.4-fold faster decline in non-users (p = 0.038).

These results suggest an association between the use of trazodone and a slower rate of cognitive decline.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^1155Sgec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Another limitation pertains to whether the observed trazodone effects are primarily mediated through SWS enhancement. In this study, quantified data of SWS were not available for correlating to the rate of cognitive decline. Additionally, it is possible that trazodone effects could be mediated through its antidepressant benefits. We do not believe the latter is the case, since trazodone is rarely, if ever, given as an antidepressant in our cohort. Moreover, antidepressant doses of trazodone are usually much higher than doses for insomnia that were prescribed for our participants and often relate to carry-over cognitive deficits the following day, albeit less severe than those observed with certain other antidepressants. Nonetheless, a prospective study would be the optimal approach in controlling potential antidepressant-mediated cognitive benefits of trazodone.

An alternative possibility of the observed trazodone benefits could be explained by its possible neuroprotective effects via inhibition of the phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response (eIF2 α-P/UPR). Specifically, in the MAPT P301L mouse model of tauopathy, trazodone use was associated with less memory deficits, preserved hippocampal neuronal counts, delayed gross brain atrophy, and prolonged survival. Interestingly, the eIF2 α-P/UPR pathway is also induced during sleep deprivation of wild-type mice, providing an additional mechanistic explanation through which improving disturbances in sleep may be neuroprotective.

### Comparative effectiveness of second-generation antidepressants for accompanying anxiety, insomnia, and pain in depressed patients: a systematic review [^115p4DMo]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) often suffer from accompanying symptoms that influence the choice of pharmacotherapy with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). We conducted a systematic review to determine the comparative effectiveness of citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and trazodone for accompanying anxiety, insomnia, and pain in patients with MDD.

- **Methods**: We conducted searches in multiple databases, including MEDLINE®, Embase, the Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and PsycINFO, from 1980 through August 2011, and reviewed reference lists of pertinent articles. We dually reviewed abstracts, full-text articles, and abstracted data. We included randomized, head-to-head trials of SGAs of at least 6 weeks' duration. We grouped SGAs into three classes for the analysis: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and others. We graded the strength of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach.

- **Results**: We located 19 head-to-head trials in total: 11 on anxiety, six on insomnia, and four on pain. For the majority of comparisons, the strength of the evidence was moderate or low; evidence is weakened by inconsistency and imprecision. For treating anxiety, insomnia, and pain, moderate evidence suggests that the SSRIs do not differ.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^115TqMoV]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are associated with a substantial economic burden. Depending on the severity of the fall, costs per fall can range from $1,596 to $10,913, and costs for fall-related hospitalizations can range from $10,052 to $42,840 (2010 USD). Total annual costs of insomnia in the US are estimated at $77 to $116 billion, with $75 to $100 billion of these costs being indirect. Thus, present results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating a substantial public health burden and elevated direct medical costs associated with both insomnia treatment and falls.

Our study possesses several strengths. Most importantly, we performed a comprehensive, large-scale analysis of the impact of treated insomnia on falls and other adverse outcomes among older adults. Additionally, our Medicare sample is highly generalizable, representing 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in the US. We considered the most widely prescribed insomnia treatments, including low-dose trazodone, which is frequently used off-label to treat insomnia. Furthermore, we employed multiple measures to maximize the specificity of our operational definitions, such as excluding patients receiving benzodiazepines with a concurrent diagnosis of anxiety.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116omjgd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of trazodone on all secondary outcomes were non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons but reveal a trend of delayed cognitive decline for almost all measures. We specifically tested trazodone effects on short-term memory and executive tests, considering the known involvement of hippocampal and prefrontal areas in sleep-mediated effects via slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancement on these cognitive domains. Even though the results were not significant, the observed trend is promising for pursuing tailored studies that are powered to identify a potential beneficial effect in specific cognitive domains.

It is worth noting that cognitive benefits via SWS enhancement may vary depending on a patient's specific syndrome, such as late- or early-age-of-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, or posterior cortical atrophy. Additionally, benefits may depend on a person's age, with younger patients potentially benefitting most in executive function versus older ones in short-term memory. In our cohort of predominantly older amnestic patients, a trend was observed in both executive and short-term memory tasks.

### A post hoc analysis of the effect of nightly administration of eszopiclone and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in patients with insomnia and anxious depression [^112rA8FD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and significant anxiety are less responsive to antidepressants than those without anxiety. In this post hoc analysis of patients with insomnia and comorbid anxious depression, eszopiclone cotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was compared with placebo cotherapy.

Data were pooled from two randomized, double-blind, 8-week trials. One trial (conducted from January 2004 to October 2004) included patients with DSM-IV insomnia and comorbid MDD treated with fluoxetine concurrently with eszopiclone 3 mg/d or placebo. The other trial (conducted from July 2005 to April 2006) included patients with DSM-IV-TR insomnia and comorbid generalized anxiety disorder treated with escitalopram concurrently with eszopiclone 3 mg/d or placebo. Anxious depression was defined as a baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score ≥ 14 (excluding insomnia items) and an anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. Treatment group differences were determined for mean changes in HDRS-17 scores (with and without insomnia items), HDRS anxiety/somatization scores, and response and remission rates. Severity of insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

In the combined dataset, 347 of 1,136 patients (30.5%) had insomnia and comorbid anxious depression. Significant improvements in insomnia were observed for eszopiclone cotherapy relative to placebo cotherapy (mean change from baseline on the ISI: -11.0 vs -7.8, respectively; P < .001). There were greater reductions in HDRS-17 scores.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^115Wn3mx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

An article by La et al. in this issue provides evidence that trazodone delayed cognitive decline in 25 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. For participants considered to have AD pathology, trazodone non-users declined at a rate 2.4 times greater than those taking trazodone for sleep over a 4-year period. In the analysis of sleep complaints, the relationship between trazodone, a widely used medication for sleep problems in the elderly, and cognition was associated with a subjective improvement of sleep disruption. Due to the study design, it was not possible to prove that the benefit of slowing cognitive decline was due specifically to the improvement in sleep. However, trazodone uniquely improves the deeper phases of slow-wave sleep. Other sedative medications are generally associated with worse cognitive function over time, and they do not improve sleep characteristics as does trazodone.

Trazodone has a variety of effects on several monoaminergic mechanisms: it is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Because of the potential importance of this finding, further discussion is provided on the roles that trazodone may play in the modulation of monoamines, cognition, and the development of AD. If trazodone truly provides such a dramatic slowing in the development of dementia associated with AD, a great deal more research on trazodone is needed, including environmental and behavioral factors.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^114NVM2e]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Comparisons on primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups followed repeated-measures analysis of variance while accounting for inter-evaluation intervals, i.e. the length of time between baseline and final visits. Cognitive and functional assessment scores were treated as dependent variables, and trazodone use as a fixed factor. The significance level was set at 0.05, and one-tailed significance testing was performed given the a priori hypothesis that trazodone is associated with delayed cognitive decline. Significance testing on secondary outcomes and post-hoc analyses accounted for multiple comparisons by applying the Bonferroni correction.

Additional analyses tested trazodone effects on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) only in participants who had Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-predicted pathology based on clinical judgment, accounting for concomitant sedative and stimulant medication effects. A sedative medication binary variable represented the use of the following: benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, narcotics, atypical antipsychotics, antihistamines, or anticholinergic medications. A stimulant medication binary variable represented the use of the following: cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEi), dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic agents.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^116nGu3b]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

At the same time, our methodology has limitations for consideration. Most importantly, we were unable to assess some clinical variables, including insomnia symptoms or severity, daytime function, and quality of life. We did not match on specific comorbidities, concomitant medication use, or previous fall history, but we controlled for comorbidity burden using the Charlson Comorbidity Index in the adjusted generalized linear models. Claims data limitations did not allow us to control for patient frailty or severity of illness. It has been suggested that these patients may use hypnotics more often for reasons such as stress and fear due to an underlying severe illness.

We assessed only falls that required medical attention and were unable to assess falls that resulted in death. There is currently no validated algorithm to identify patients with insomnia in administrative claims data, and insomnia is underreported and underdiagnosed. Thus, we relied on prescription drug claims for on- or off-label insomnia treatments to identify patients with treated insomnia. Dosing was limited for trazodone to ≤ 100 mg without requiring an accompanying insomnia diagnosis to further ensure its use for insomnia in the absence of a diagnosis code. Claims data do not contain information on whether or when the patient took their prescription medication, only the fill date. We did not control for the extent of exposure (dosage and persistence) in the analysis; effects were attributed to the first index medication with ≥ 5 days' supply.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116fHLMe]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Results

Trazodone's longitudinal effects on primary and secondary outcomes are documented in Tables 2 and 3. Non-users of trazodone declined 2.6-fold faster on the MMSE compared to trazodone users, with an estimated inter-evaluation interval averaging 4.12 years for both groups (Fig. 2). The effects of trazodone on MMSE remained significant even when only participants with AD-predicted pathology were included. In this subgroup, non-users declined 2.4-fold faster than trazodone users over an average interval of 3.75 years. These effects varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications, retaining significance when considering overall concomitant sedative and stimulant use. In such cases, non-users declined 1.94-fold faster than trazodone users. However, trazodone's effects were not significant when accounting solely for ChEi use. The latter finding did not reflect confounding effects from correlated administration of trazodone and ChEi (φ = –0.131; p = 0.355).

Additional post-hoc analysis was conducted to address possible non-linear decline in MMSE associated with the longer inter-evaluation interval for trazodone non-users. The results showed that non-users declined 2.0-fold faster on the MMSE compared to trazodone users, with an estimated inter-evaluation interval averaging 3.59 years. Each group retained the same annual rate of decline (0.3 versus 0.7 points per year on MMSE for trazodone users versus non-users). These effects of trazodone on MMSE were marginally non-significant (p = 0.054), as compared to Table 1. The evaluation of sleep mediating effects of trazodone on longitudinal MMSE performance is ongoing.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^1172sCmY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This study was a retrospective cohort analysis utilizing the 100% Medicare administrative claims database, specifically the research identifiable files (RIFs), from January 2011 through December 2017. The Medicare database comprises three types of files: data allowing patient identification, dataset files with patient-level information without identifiers, and aggregated data without patient or provider details. The care settings included in the Medicare database encompass outpatient, inpatient, skilled nursing facilities, hospice, home health agencies, and prescription drugs. It is important to note that claims data typically offer information on service provision, such as a laboratory test, rather than the test outcome.

Patients receiving insomnia treatment were identified from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016. The index date was defined as the earliest fill date for an insomnia medication of interest, which included benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem ER (extended release), and zolpidem IR (immediate release). Based on available market research, the most commonly used prescription insomnia medications were selected for analysis. Other prescription insomnia medications were not included due to low sample size issues arising from limited time on the market or low market share. Additionally, a matched control cohort of non-sleep-disordered adults was identified from January 2012 through December 2016. Patients in the control group were matched 1-to-1 with individuals receiving insomnia treatment.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: An international scoping review [^116ySW36]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Over thirty years of prescriptive guidance on benzodiazepines (BZD) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRA) from groups of international clinician experts on anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders, and insomnia demonstrate that these agents are still clearly not recommended as routine first-line agents or for longer-term use (i.e. beyond four weeks) in most patients. Recommendations on their use have not generally changed, but the lack of explicit direction on prescribing details, noted in many documents, can be further elaborated on in future iterations of guidelines.

A renewed focus on deprescribing of these agents within the past ten years has elucidated areas of attention for research work to inform future guideline development panels. The shift of deprescribing practices involving BZD from a clinical 'art' to a clinical 'science'-based practice should be a continued focus for guideline committees, with attention to comparing dose reduction strategies. This includes the use or non-use of diazepam (or other long-acting BZD), the use or non-use of adjunctive pharmacotherapies, and the value of 'micro' tapers using either compounded products or patient-directed alteration of available dosage forms.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: A systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^117U8AdT]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A comprehensive search for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies, and observational studies was conducted using a pre-developed search term across four databases: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

The PICOS-framework was employed to develop a search term:

- **Population**: People over 65 years - **Intervention**: BDLM - **Comparator**: No limits - **Outcomes**: See list above 'Types of outcomes' - **Study design**: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies, and observational studies. The full search term can be found as Additional file 1.

The search was conducted on June 19, 2019, by a data research team at the University of Witten using the OVID interface for each database.

Search results were saved using the EndNote X9 reference management software, and results were de-duplicated upon retrieval.

The titles and abstracts identified were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers. Full-text articles were obtained for all references meeting the inclusion criteria or where there was uncertainty about inclusion. VS, LH, and EM participated in this task. Consensus was established, and in cases of disagreement, arbitration was conducted by AS.

Reference lists of included studies and studies identified via snowballing were screened for eligibility, and studies excluded in full text were listed with a justification for exclusion. The data extraction was conducted independently using a previously developed protocol.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^111tNC34]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Since the 2000s, there has been vigorous debate in the literature among psychiatrists and other health professionals practicing within the bounds of clinical psychopharmacology. This debate has resulted in a continued division of competing perspectives about BZD-related benefits and harms for different clinical circumstances. The perspective that various guidelines on BZD prescribing have been largely concordant with one another for common mental health and sleep concerns, while commonly held among clinicians and academics, has not yet been subject to rigorous scrutiny. This scrutiny is necessary to examine differences between recommendations and guidance from these differing groups of experts.

We sought to characterize parameters relevant to BZD and BZRA prescribing and de-prescribing in clinical practice guidelines and prescribing guidance documents for adult patients with anxiety disorders and insomnia. The inclusion of unipolar depressive disorders in this review is relevant for applicability to common patient encounters in both primary care and psychiatry, where depressive and anxiety illnesses are often either comorbid or mixed to varying extents in their symptom presentation.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia [^115tVjP6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. The reasons for the preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concomitant sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication, and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. Additionally, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves.

Here, we review the pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific well-defined populations.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^111GD1dw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a hypnotic and antidepressant (pharmacologically, a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor), is used for the management of insomnia and nighttime behavioral disturbances, irritability, agitation, and aggression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Trazodone has a favorable safety profile if administered in small doses and appears to produce a stabilization of the circadian rhythms in individuals with AD. Because of its hypnotic properties, trazodone may be particularly useful in patients with nocturnal agitation.

There is growing interest in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to target agitation and aggression in dementia. A recent large randomized controlled trial found that citalopram significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress compared to placebo. Worsening cognition and QT prolongation were significantly more common in the citalopram group (30 mg/day). Patients in the study were required to have treatment-requiring levels of agitation; those with major depression or psychosis requiring antipsychotics were excluded. Assessment of the 20 mg (the maximum dose recommended by the FDA in adults over 60) has not been conducted. Comparator studies indicate sertraline and citalopram are probably as effective as risperidone in treating agitation in dementia, especially among those with mild-moderate agitation severity.

Dextromethorphan/quinidine, a combination drug containing dextromethorphan, an n-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and high-affinity sigma-1 receptor agonist, and the antiarrhythmic agent quinidine, is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of agitation in dementia.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^1158bvzW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue, an article by La et al. provides evidence that trazodone delayed cognitive decline in 25 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. For participants with AD pathology, trazodone non-users declined at a rate 2.4 times greater than those taking trazodone for sleep over a four-year period.

The relationship between trazodone and cognition was associated with subjective improvement of sleep disruption, as trazodone is a widely used medication for sleep problems in the elderly. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to prove that the benefit of slowing cognitive decline was due specifically to the improvement in sleep. However, trazodone uniquely improves the deeper phases of slow-wave sleep. Other sedative medications are generally associated with worse cognitive function over time, and they do not improve sleep characteristics as does trazodone.

Trazodone has a variety of effects on several monoaminergic mechanisms: it is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Because of the potential importance of this finding, further discussion is provided on the roles that trazodone may play in the modulation of monoamines, cognition, and the development of AD.

If trazodone really does provide such a dramatic slowing in the development of dementia associated with AD, a great deal more research on trazodone is needed, including environmental and behavioral factors.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^111sLA1o]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine, was developed in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories. Trazodone was approved for medical use in December 1981 in the US by the FDA as an anti-depressant medication, Desyrel. However, trazodone is a less effective anti-depressant than many other agents. Further, the drug had already had extensive use outside of the US, so there was a relatively short patent life, and the drug became generic in 1986. Thus, there was a lack of pharmaceutical industry support for extensive research on this drug.

In spite of the commercial difficulties for trazodone, clinical experiences soon showed that this drug has several beneficial effects. Trazodone is unique in its effects on sleep, increasing the deeper stages of SWS early in the sleep cycle and delaying REM onset. There are an extensive number of studies that have supported the use of trazodone for insomnia. Trazodone is one of the top two drugs used for off-label prescribing, usually for insomnia. It is also beneficial and widely used for anxiety and is arguably the most effective drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), likely because of its effects on sleep. Trazodone was tested for a potential benefit for agitation in AD, but the complex, multi-center study design did not show a statistically significant benefit relative to other interventions, in spite of its reported usefulness in the management of agitation in dementia and PTSD. In 2015, 27.6 million prescriptions for trazodone were filled in the US.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^111J8czV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesia such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.

- **Angle-closure glaucoma**: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid the use of antidepressants, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache.

### Effectiveness of sequential psychological and medication therapies for insomnia disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^114KKw9i]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Despite the evidence of efficacious psychological and pharmacologic therapies for insomnia, there is little information about what first-line treatment should be and how best to proceed when initial treatment fails.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of four treatment sequences involving psychological and medication therapies for insomnia and examine the moderating effect of psychiatric disorders on insomnia outcomes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: In a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, patients were assigned to a first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT; n = 104) or zolpidem (zolpidem; n = 107). Patients who did not remit received a second treatment involving either medication (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy [CT]). The study took place at Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Québec, Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, and at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, with the enrollment of patients taking place from August 2012 through July 2017.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoints were the treatment response and remission rates, defined by the Insomnia Severity Index total score.

- **Results**: Patients included 211 adults (132 women; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years) with chronic insomnia disorder, including 74 patients with a comorbid anxiety or mood disorder. First-stage therapy with BT or zolpidem produced equivalent weighted percentages of responders (BT, 45.5%; zolpidem, 49.7%; OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.60–2.33) and remitters (BT, 38.03%; zolpidem, 30.3%).

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^116ygM1t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In a recent review article on the prevalence of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence in depressed patients, it was shown that subjective complaints of insomnia or daytime somnolence were frequent in patients suffering from depression or anxiety disorders treated with SSRI and SNRI.

Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) study register, the average prevalence of treatment-emergent insomnia in clinical trials with SSRI was 17% as compared to 9% of patients randomized to the placebo arm. The average rate of treatment-emergent somnolence in patients being treated with SSRI amounted to 16% as compared to 8% of patients receiving placebo. The lowest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia complaints (below 2%) was reported in the study with citalopram. The highest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence was found in patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) being treated with high-dose fluvoxamine, 31% and 27%, respectively.

In clinical trials with SNRI, treatment-emergent insomnia was reported on average in 13% of SNRI-treated patients as compared to 7% of the placebo arm, and treatment-emergent somnolence in 10% of SNRI-treated patients in comparison to 5% of patients receiving placebo. Both treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence were the most frequent (both equal to 24%) in patients with generalized anxiety disorders treated with venlafaxine. The lowest rate of treatment-emergent insomnia and somnolence (both below 2%) was reported for levomilnacipran.

### Does online insomnia treatment reduce depressive symptoms? A randomized controlled trial in individuals with both insomnia and depressive symptoms [^116KEgyK]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there have only been four studies that investigated CBT-I as a standalone treatment for people with both depressive symptoms and insomnia. Two of those studies used face-to-face treatment and both failed to demonstrate an effect of insomnia treatment on depressive symptoms compared with depression treatment-as-usual [Wagley et al.] and compared with relaxation therapy [Norell-Clarke et al.]. The other two studies used online CBT-I as a standalone treatment for depressive symptoms and insomnia. Those studies showed more promising results. Blom and colleagues showed that online CBT-I was significantly more effective than online depression treatment on insomnia but as effective on depressive symptoms [Blom et al.]. However, the sample size of this study was small and replication is needed before conclusions can be drawn. Christensen and colleagues demonstrated that online CBT-I effectively reduced depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms in patients with complaints of both compared with an online placebo module. However, people with higher scores of depressive symptoms were excluded (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 > 20 [Spitzer et al.]).

We aimed to replicate the findings of Christensen and colleagues and expand them by not excluding people with higher levels of depressive symptoms, in a randomized controlled design comparing online CBT-I (i-Sleep) with a non-treated control group, monitoring their sleep daily. The online treatment included online feedback by a coach as this has been shown to potentiate efficacy [Lancee et al.]. We hypothesized that i-Sleep would…

### Electroconvulsive therapy and cardiovascular complications in patients taking trazodone for insomnia [^116znRY6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Trazodone has been widely used to treat insomnia in depressed patients. When used in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), trazodone has been suspected of causing cardiovascular side effects.

- **Method**: A retrospective study was conducted on 100 patients who received ECT with concomitant trazodone. One patient was excluded because permission to review the patient's records was not given. The remaining 99 patients were matched with control ECT patients.

- **Results**: No statistically significant between-group differences were identified in cardiovascular side effects, although a trend toward more orthostatic hypotension was observed in patients taking trazodone.

- **Conclusion**: Administering low-dose trazodone for insomnia in conjunction with ECT does not appear to increase cardiovascular complications. The true incidence of adverse cardiac events was not higher than 3.66% at a 95% confidence level.

### Effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis: A randomized clinical trial [^116VLkhq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, published by Rajnish Mehrotra and colleagues in 2024 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, investigates insomnia and chronic kidney disease. It poses the question: What is the role of trazodone in patients undergoing hemodialysis with mild or moderate chronic insomnia?

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 83 patients (41 female, 42 male). Inclusion criteria required patients undergoing hemodialysis with an Insomnia Severity Index score of ≥ 10 and sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights per week for ≥ 3 months. Key exclusion criteria included severe cognitive impairment, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, alcohol or substance misuse, severe restless legs syndrome, pregnancy/lactation, and an anticipated life expectancy of less than 3 months.

The interventions were as follows: 42 patients received trazodone (starting dose of 50 mg nightly, titrated to 100 mg over 6 weeks), while 41 patients received a matching placebo for 6 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a borderline significant increase in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 7 (4.2 points vs. 3.1 points; AD 1.08 points, 95% CI -1.34 to 3.49).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a borderline significant decrease in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 25 (4 points vs. 4.3 points; AD -0.34 points, 95% CI -3.17 to 2.49). There was no significant difference in reduction.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114FfDpd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults (i.e. age ≥ 65 years) and incur a substantial economic burden due to costs associated with subsequent fractures, hospital visits, and long-term care. In particular, medication-related falls or fractures are recognized as an important consideration for clinicians when initiating new pharmacotherapy in older adult patients. Clinical experts have published guidelines, such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria, to help inform treatment decisions. However, details on guideline use when treating certain conditions are scant.

Insomnia is a common sleep–wake disorder characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or both, and is more prevalent among older adults. These individuals are more likely to be prescribed medication for insomnia treatment. Medication classes commonly used to treat insomnia — including benzodiazepines and z-drugs (i.e. non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem) — can have adverse effects that may pose an elevated risk for older adults. Benzodiazepine adverse effects include cognitive and memory impairment, rebound insomnia upon cessation, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, dependence, and addiction. Z-drugs are associated with next day cognitive, memory, psychomotor, and balance impairments, and risk of dependence and addiction. Thus, these medications may be inappropriate for use in older adults, particularly those with a history of falls or fractures, due to unfavorable risk–benefit ratios. Clinicians often prescribe these medications with caution to mitigate such risks.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114zMxGv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This national analysis of 100% Medicare claims examined outcomes for older adult patients treated with commonly prescribed medications for insomnia (i.e. benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem IR, zolpidem ER). Compared with non-sleep disordered controls, treated adult patients demonstrated significantly increased risks of falls, all-cause mortality, and adverse economic outcomes. Although prescribers may perceive trazodone as a lower-risk alternative for the treatment of insomnia, this study's findings suggest that trazodone, like benzodiazepines and zolpidem, is associated with a higher risk of falls and increased healthcare resource utilization compared to controls.

- **Observational study insights**: Risk varied by insomnia medication, with benzodiazepines and trazodone typically being associated with the worst outcomes. It is important to note, however, that this was an observational study rather than a randomized controlled trial, so the results are associative rather than causal.

Future research should aim to identify patients at the greatest risk of adverse outcomes from commonly prescribed insomnia treatments and to match these individuals with safe and effective alternatives. Most importantly, these results highlight the need for insomnia treatments suitable for older adults with insomnia that do not increase the risk of falls.

### Sleep-HD trial: Short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^115aKftk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

There is a compelling need to identify effective treatments for insomnia in HD patients, and the interventions being studied in this clinical trial (telehealth CBT-I and trazodone) have a strong scientific premise. Most HD patients experience significant impairments in quality of life, mainly due to the high frequency of disabling symptoms. Insomnia is one of the most frequently reported symptoms, and studies of HD patients and other populations suggest that it significantly contributes to other common symptoms and poor health outcomes. It is essential to know that insomnia is common in HD patients with comorbid depression but is independent of sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome.

There are unique contributors to chronic insomnia in HD patients, including the biological effects of residual uremia after partial correction, as achieved with dialysis technology, maladaptation to treatment schedules, and patients' napping during treatments. If telehealth CBT-I is effective for treating insomnia in HD patients, it will create an option that is presently unavailable to patients. Trazodone is widely used, but the data on its efficacy for treating insomnia in HD patients are limited as well.

We identified participants from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center cohort who satisfied the following criteria: 1) presence of sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or parasomnia, as documented on the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center assessment form; 2) longitudinal clinical, medication, and neuropsychological data; and 3) diagnostic grouping as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitively non-impaired (CN) on their first visit. All participants provided informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The presence of insomnia, hypersomnia, or parasomnia was documented by a physician in an ordinal manner as absent, mild (i.e. present and not interfering significantly with daily function), or severe (i.e. interfering significantly with daily function). Since only two participants had severe sleep symptoms, sleep variables were binarized as present or absent at each visit for further analysis.

The diagnoses of AD, amnestic MCI, and non-amnestic MCI were made using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD and the MCI criteria developed by Petersen et al. Molecular AD biomarkers were available for 14 participants. Amyloid PET was performed in eleven participants, and CSF amyloid-β/tau levels were obtained in five, with two participants undergoing both tests. From the eligible pool of volunteers, we identified 25 participants who reported regular trazodone use for at least two consecutive annual visits. Detailed longitudinal dosage and indication for trazodone use were available for 16 out of 25 trazodone users, all of whom listed insomnia as the reason for use.

### A randomized-controlled trial targeting cognition in early Alzheimer's disease by improving sleep with trazodone (REST) [^111ocety]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among aging populations worldwide. Despite extensive research efforts, treatment options for this devastating neurodegenerative disease are limited. Sleep disturbances, through their link to changes in neural excitability and impaired clearance of interstitial abnormal protein aggregates, present a key risk factor for the development of AD. Research also suggests that the neuroprotective effects of sleep are particularly active during slow wave sleep. Given the strong link between sleep disturbance and AD, targeting sleep in the prodromal stages of AD, such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), represents a promising avenue for slowing the onset of AD-related cognitive decline.

In efforts to improve sleep in older individuals, several pharmacologic approaches have been employed, but many pose safety risks, concerns for worsening cognitive function, and fail to effectively target slow wave sleep. Trazodone, a safe and widely used drug in the older adult population, has shown promise in inducing slow wave sleep in older adults but requires more rigorous research to understand its effects on sleep and cognition in the prodromal stages of AD. This review presents the rationale and study design for our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (NCT05282550) investigating the effects of trazodone on sleep and cognition in 100 older adults with amnestic MCI and sleep complaints.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^115uCm4W]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

There are inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing after randomized allocation between groups and monitor medication compliance across a predefined time period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management of participants by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors. Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimen. It is thus possible there is a biased selection against people who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant to achieving better sleep consolidation through SWS enhancers.

Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may be able to address. Eventually, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks or whether they primarily result from other factors.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^113Ya8kk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

While much attention has been given to the plaque and tangle pathology of the neocortex, as well as the hippocampus and amygdala, recent attention has focused on brainstem mechanisms. It is now understood that the earliest pathological changes involving hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau are actually in the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nuclei. This shift in focus has considerable implications for understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, as well as developing new approaches to its prevention and treatment.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are all associated with increased AD risk. Serotonergic medications are approved for the treatment of PTSD. PTSD likely causes some underlying derangement in the brainstem, involving serotonin and sleep mechanisms. A well-known relationship exists between anxiety, norepinephrine, and the locus coeruleus, which is related to nocturnal behavior. Depression is commonly treated with serotonin and norepinephrine medications, implicating brainstem mechanisms in this broad condition, and it has also been studied as a frequent prodromal condition of AD. TBI is often associated with loss of consciousness and memory problems, implicating brainstem mechanisms. Therefore, addressing the serotonin and norepinephrine systems in individuals who have suffered a significant TBI is also relevant.

Thus, a major consideration that may apply to PTSD, anxiety, depression, and TBI is whether trazodone could benefit affected individuals by delaying their long-term outcomes.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^113PERcJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death among older Americans. While some research has found that insomnia heightens falls, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and costs, the impact of insomnia treatments on fall risk, mortality, HCRU, and costs in the elderly population, which could be of substantial interest to payers, has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated the risk of falls and related consequences among adults aged 65 years or older treated with common prescription medications for insomnia compared with non-sleep disordered controls.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of deidentified Medicare claims from January 2011 through December 2017. Medicare beneficiaries treated for insomnia receiving zolpidem extended-release, zolpidem immediate-release, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were matched with non-sleep disordered controls. The main outcomes were falls, mortality, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and medical costs during the 12 months following the earliest fill date for the insomnia medication of interest. Generalized linear models controlled for several key covariates, including age, race, sex, geographic region, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score.

- **Results**: The study included 1,699,913 Medicare beneficiaries (59.9% female, mean age 75 years). Relative to controls, adjusted analyses showed that beneficiaries receiving insomnia medication experienced over twice as many falls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34, 95% CI: 2.31–2.36). In adjusted analyses, patients receiving benzodiazepines or trazodone had the greatest risk.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^111HAwFh]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Participant selection was guided by a flow chart derived from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center's research volunteer cohort. This chart considered reported sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or parasomnia, alongside diagnostic group, available medication data, and reported trazodone use. Propensity matching was based on age, sex, education, type of sleep disturbance, diagnostic group, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Demographic characteristics were assessed at the baseline visit. Categories included cognitively non-impaired (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Pearson χ², Mann-Whitney tests for non-parametric measures, and t-tests for parametric measures were employed.

We aimed to account for moderation effects on outcome measures of inter-evaluation intervals due to the natural progression of diseases. For trazodone users, baseline and final evaluations corresponded to the first and last visits with reported trazodone use. In contrast, for non-users, these time points corresponded to the first and last visits with medication data available. We anticipated follow-up intervals would differ between paired participants in the two groups, to facilitate propensity matching of inter-evaluation intervals. Consequently, our analysis included inter-evaluation intervals as a covariate from the outset.

The interval between baseline and final visits differed between the two groups (mean ± SD; trazodone users: 3.1 ± 1.9 years, non-users: 5.1 ± 2.8 years; p = 0.013), and these interval effects were incorporated in all analyses. Nevertheless, to address possible non-linear effects of inter-evaluation interval differences, further analysis is warranted.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^115HXYsL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical experience in trazodone prescription**: Trazodone has been in use in the US since 1981, offering substantial knowledge about its benefits and side effects. It antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, potentially causing postural hypotension. It also induces sedation and can lead to uncomfortable sensations. Being predominantly metabolized in liver microsomes, trazodone requires careful dosing in patients with liver damage due to their heightened sensitivity. The compound has a half-life of 3 to 5 hours, necessitating careful dose titration for each patient (starting at 12.5 mg at bedtime with 12.5 mg increments).

- **Comparison with other medications**: Trazodone exhibits minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors, unlike older antidepressants. It produces higher quality sleep compared to GABA agonists (e.g. benzodiazepines), anticholinergics, or antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine). These latter medications are known to impair short-term cognitive function and may contribute to dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology over the long term.

- **Effects on sexual function**: Generally, trazodone enhances sexual desire and male erectile function but can cause priapism, a medical emergency. This side effect resembles those associated with erectile dysfunction treatments. Abnormal erectile function is estimated to occur in approximately one in 6,000 male patients, primarily affecting younger individuals.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^114YKKG2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

In summary, the pervasiveness and consistency of the observed trazodone effects, especially after considering disease severity and concomitant medication use, encourages further investigation into its effectiveness on preserving cognition via sleep-wake rhythm consolidation. Implications on clinical practice involve improving quality of life for patients who experience sleep disturbances that, if untreated, may promote future amyloid-β deposition. Furthermore, potential cognitive benefits of trazodone may be applicable to both cognitively intact older adults and mildly impaired patients with dementia. The effectiveness of trazodone, possibly achieved by decreasing amyloid-β aggregation and pathologic tau burden, as well as by improving sleep-mediated memory consolidation, can be further explored through controlled clinical trials.

### Antidepressants for insomnia in adults [^11577JAF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep, such as issues with sleep onset, maintenance, early waking, and impairment of daytime functioning. It impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. Hypnotic medications, such as benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs, are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of psychological treatments.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.

- **Search methods**: This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015), and PsycINFO (1806 to 2015). We updated the searches to December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or older) with a primary diagnosis of insomnia were included, considering all participant types, including those with comorbidities. Any antidepressant as monotherapy at any dose, whether compared with placebo or active comparator, was eligible for inclusion.

### Does online insomnia treatment reduce depressive symptoms? A randomized controlled trial in individuals with both insomnia and depressive symptoms [^113ks9Ut]. Psychological Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Insomnia is effectively treated with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Previous research has suggested the effects might not be limited to sleep and insomnia severity but also apply to depressive symptoms. Results, however, are mixed.

- **Methods**: In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of guided online CBT-I on depression and insomnia in people suffering from symptoms of both. Participants (n = 104) with clinical insomnia and at least subclinical depression levels were randomized to (1) guided online CBT-I and sleep diary monitoring (i-Sleep) or (2) a control group (sleep diary monitoring only). The primary outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 without sleep item; PHQ-WS). Secondary outcomes were insomnia severity, sleep diary parameters, fatigue, daytime consequences of insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking.

- **Results**: At post-test, participants in the i-Sleep condition reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms (PHQ-WS) compared with participants in the sleep-diary condition (d = 0.76). Large significant effects were also observed for insomnia severity (d = 2.36), most sleep diary parameters, daytime consequences of insomnia, anxiety, and perseverative thinking. Effects were maintained at 3 and 6-month follow-ups. We did not find significant post-test effects on fatigue or total sleep time.

- **Conclusions**: Findings indicate that guided online CBT-I is not only effective for insomnia complaints but also for depressive symptoms. The effects are large and comparable.

### Treatment of insomnia associated with clinical depression [^113Yf7CA]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are almost always present in patients with depression. Although sleep disturbances generally abate with the resolution of depression, some patients continue to report poor sleep. Since a number of studies have demonstrated that insomnia increases the risk of new-onset depression and recurrence of depression, optimal management of insomnia associated with depression becomes an important clinical goal. Antidepressant agents have variable effects on sleep; in fact, some antidepressants seem to worsen sleep in patients with depression. This article reviews various treatment options in the management of patients presenting with insomnia and depression, including single agents, combination strategies, and behavioral interventions.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^115nVK9V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Dose selection**: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e. more severely depressed patients) may be given up to, but not in excess of, 600 mg/day in divided doses. Once an adequate response has been achieved, the dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

- **Administration instructions**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly following a meal or light snack.

- **Screen for bipolar disorder prior to starting trazodone hydrochloride tablets**: Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Switching to or from monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants**: At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and the initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping…

### Differential effects of nefazodone and cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy on insomnia associated with chronic forms of major depression [^112i5Yrq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The antidepressant nefazodone and the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) were recently found to have significant, additive effects in a large multicenter study of chronic forms of major depression. As nefazodone-mediated blockade of serotonin-2 receptors may directly relieve insomnia associated with depression, we examined the more specific effects of CBASP and nefazodone, singly and in combination, on sleep disturbances.

- **Method**: A total of 597 chronically depressed outpatients (DSM-III-R criteria) with at least one insomnia symptom were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with nefazodone (mean final dose = 466 mg/day), CBASP (mean = 16.0 sessions), or the combination (mean dose = 460 mg/day plus a mean of 16.2 CBASP sessions). Continuous and categorical insomnia outcomes, derived from standard clinician- and self-rated assessments, were compared.

- **Results**: Patients receiving nefazodone (either alone or in combination with CBASP) obtained significantly more rapid and greater ultimate improvement in insomnia ratings when compared with those treated with CBASP alone. This difference was maximal by the fourth week of therapy and sustained thereafter. Combined treatment did not result in markedly better insomnia scores than treatment with nefazodone alone on most measures, although patients receiving both CBASP and nefazodone were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater decrease in insomnia severity.

- **Conclusion**: Despite comparable antidepressant efficacy, monotherapy with nefazodone or CBASP resulted in markedly different outcomes for insomnia.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^115Ak6Tk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of trazodone's antidepressant action is not fully understood but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS. Trazodone is both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a 5HT2 receptor antagonist. The net result of this action on serotonergic transmission and its role in trazodone's antidepressant effect is unknown.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin (Ki = 367 nM) and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A (Ki = 35.6 nM) serotonin receptors. Trazodone is also an antagonist at several other monoaminergic receptors, including 5-HT2B (Ki = 78.4 nM), 5-HT2C (Ki = 224 nM), α1A (Ki = 153 nM), α2C (Ki = 155 nM) receptors, and it is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A (Ki = 118 nM) receptor. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

	- **Absorption**: In humans, trazodone hydrochloride is absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone hydrochloride is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration, and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone hydrochloride is taken on an empty stomach or two hours after dosing when taken with food.
