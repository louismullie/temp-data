## Question

Pathophysio of turp syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of TURP syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initiating event and the role of irrigation fluid. Then, I should verify the mechanisms of fluid absorption and quantify the volume thresholds that matter. Next, I will examine the core pathophysiology, including dilutional hyponatremia, hypervolemia, and solute-specific toxicities. After that, I need to map the clinical manifestations by organ system and reconcile the sodium level–symptom discordance. Finally, I should integrate risk factors, modern mitigation strategies, and a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to bedside implications.

> Let me first confirm the initiating event. TURP syndrome begins with systemic absorption of large volumes of nonconductive, electrolyte-free irrigation fluid through open prostatic venous sinuses during resection, a process facilitated by high intravesical pressure and prolonged operative time. This is the necessary first step that sets the cascade in motion [^1123XjQt] [^111xKT7p] [^113ya8b4].

> Wait, let me verify the absorption dynamics and thresholds. Small-to-moderate absorption (about 1–2 liters) is not rare and may be clinically silent, whereas larger volumes (> 3 liters) are associated with overt neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms. A fluid deficit of roughly 1–1.5 liters during monopolar TURP correlates with increased risk of neurologic symptoms, and the severity escalates with greater absorbed volumes, underscoring a dose–response relationship [^1123XjQt] [^113ya8b4] [^112Q4NWU].

> I will now examine the core pathophysiology. The primary insult is acute dilutional hyponatremia from water loading, which lowers serum sodium and serum osmolality. Critically, neurologic injury is driven more by hypo-osmolality than by the absolute sodium value, causing water influx into brain cells and cerebral edema, while simultaneously producing intravascular hypervolemia that strains the cardiovascular system [^1123XjQt] [^112LWkx3] [^113ya8b4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sodium thresholds dictating symptoms. I initially thought symptoms reliably begin when sodium falls below 125 mmol/L, but I should double-check that assumption. Several series show that clinically significant TUR syndrome can occur with sodium levels above 125 mmol/L, and conversely, some patients with sodium ≤ 125 mmol/L are asymptomatic, indicating poor correlation between absolute sodium and symptom severity, likely reflecting variable osmolality and solute effects [^115sPxrK] [^113Lm8Au] [^117B99h7].

> Next, I should review solute-specific toxicities beyond simple dilution. Glycine, commonly used in monopolar TURP, is directly cardiotoxic and neurotoxic; its metabolism generates ammonia, risking hyperammonemic encephalopathy, and glycine-related toxicity has been linked to ischemic ECG changes and troponin elevations, while sorbitol absorption can cause type B lactic acidosis, adding a metabolic acidosis component to the syndrome [^117MCMSj] [^113YPVKm] [^115xcZmZ].

> Let me consider the cardiovascular manifestations mechanistically. Hypervolemia increases preload and afterload, precipitating hypertension with reflex bradycardia, pulmonary edema, and acute heart failure. Glycine may also depress myocardial function, and in severe cases, circulatory collapse can occur, particularly in patients with limited cardiac reserve [^1123XjQt] [^113ya8b4] [^117MCMSj].

> I need to check the neurologic consequences next. Cerebral edema from hypo-osmolality produces headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, visual disturbances, seizures, and coma; rapid correction of acute hyponatremia is generally safe in this acute setting because osmotic demyelination risk is low when the brain has not adapted, though careful monitoring is still prudent to avoid overcorrection [^113ya8b4] [^112LWkx3].

> But wait, what about other organ systems. Visual disturbances, including transient blindness, have been reported and likely reflect both cerebral edema and glycine neurotoxicity; renal effects include acute kidney injury from hypoperfusion or hemolysis in severe cases, and endocrine-metabolic derangements such as hyperglycemia with glucose-containing irrigants and lactic acidosis with sorbitol can complicate the picture [^117MCMSj] [^1113iMJG] [^115xcZmZ] [^114a597P] [^113fUUiB].

> Next, I should review risk factors that amplify absorption and symptom risk. Prolonged operative time, larger prostate size, high irrigation pressures, and capsular or venous sinus injury increase fluid uptake. Patient factors such as advanced age and comorbid cardiopulmonary disease lower the threshold for decompensation, and continuous suprapubic drainage may paradoxically raise intravesical pressure and promote extravasation with delayed hyponatremia, while general anesthesia can mask early neurologic signs compared with spinal anesthesia [^113ya8b4] [^115KsZbg] [^113F6k3t].

> Hold on, I should verify how modern technology mitigates this. Bipolar TURP enables saline irrigation, which virtually eliminates dilutional hyponatremia and dramatically reduces TUR syndrome incidence compared with monopolar glycine-based systems. Meta-analyses and guidelines consistently show fewer TUR syndrome events and fewer transfusions with bipolar approaches, though fluid overload and even hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis can still occur if large saline volumes are absorbed, so vigilance remains essential [^1146da8P] [^1154uZD4] [^111u3Arh].

> Let me synthesize the cascade to ensure coherence. Irrigation fluid is absorbed via prostatic veins under pressure, producing acute dilutional hyponatremia with hypo-osmolality; water shifts into the brain cause cerebral edema and neurologic decline, while intravascular expansion precipitates hypertension, bradycardia, pulmonary edema, and heart failure; glycine adds direct cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects and may generate ammonia, and sorbitol can provoke lactic acidosis, with the severity scaling with the volume and rate of absorption and the solute involved [^1123XjQt] [^113ya8b4] [^117MCMSj] [^115xcZmZ].

> Finally, I should confirm the clinical implications for prevention and early detection. Limiting resection time, minimizing intravesical pressure, using bipolar saline systems when feasible, and employing real-time absorption monitoring such as expired-breath ethanol tracing reduce risk. Under regional anesthesia, early neurologic changes can be detected, prompting timely sodium correction and supportive care, whereas under general anesthesia, delayed recognition mandates proactive fluid accounting and electrolyte surveillance to avert progression to severe hyponatremia and pulmonary edema [^113ya8b4] [^115CTBLP] [^113F6k3t].

TURP syndrome is driven by **rapid absorption of large volumes of hypotonic, electrolyte-free irrigation fluid** (glycine, sorbitol, or mannitol) through open prostatic sinuses during TURP, causing acute dilutional hyponatremia, hypervolemia, and direct solute toxicity [^1123XjQt] [^113ya8b4]. The resulting **hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality** lead to cerebral edema and neurologic compromise, while fluid overload causes cardiovascular instability and pulmonary edema; glycine metabolism to ammonia can cause encephalopathy, and sorbitol/mannitol can cause lactic acidosis and hyperglycemia [^112LWkx3] [^115xcZmZ]. Risk increases with prolonged resection, high irrigation pressure, large prostate size, and capsular perforation; modern bipolar saline TURP nearly eliminates hyponatremia and TUR syndrome [^1146da8P] [^113ya8b4].

---

## Mechanisms of fluid absorption

- **Venous absorption**: Open prostatic sinuses and venous channels allow direct entry of irrigation fluid into the circulation, especially with high intravesical pressure or prolonged resection [^111xKT7p].

- **Extravasation**: Bladder or capsular perforation can cause intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid accumulation, with delayed absorption and delayed hyponatremia [^114a597P].

- **Irrigation fluid properties**: Hypotonic, electrolyte-free fluids (glycine, sorbitol, mannitol) are readily absorbed and can cause dilutional hyponatremia and solute-specific toxicities [^113ya8b4].

---

## Pathophysiological consequences

### Dilutional hyponatremia

- **Mechanism**: Large-volume absorption of electrolyte-free fluid dilutes plasma sodium, lowering serum osmolality and causing water shift into brain cells, leading to cerebral edema [^112LWkx3].

- **Neurological effects**: Headache, nausea, confusion, seizures, coma, and visual disturbances from cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure [^116LotEW].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Hypertension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and acute heart failure from hypervolemia and myocardial depression [^1123XjQt].

---

### Hypervolemia and cardiovascular effects

Hypervolemia increases **intravascular volume**, causing hypertension, reflex bradycardia, and cardiac overload [^113ya8b4]. Pulmonary edema results from increased hydrostatic pressure and capillary leak, while acute heart failure arises from volume overload and myocardial depression [^113ya8b4].

---

### Solute-specific toxicities

- **Glycine toxicity**: Glycine metabolism to ammonia can cause hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and retinal toxicity with visual disturbances [^117MCMSj].

- **Sorbitol/mannitol toxicity**: Metabolism can cause lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and osmotic diuresis, worsening electrolyte disturbances [^115xcZmZ].

---

## Risk factors for TURP syndrome

| **Risk factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Prolonged operative time (> 90 min) | Increased fluid absorption [^112fDbiA] |
| Large prostate size (> 45 g) | More venous channels exposed [^112fDbiA] |
| High irrigation pressure | Facilitates venous absorption [^111xKT7p] |
| Capsular perforation | Extravasation and delayed absorption [^115hW1fq] |
| General anesthesia | Masks early neurologic signs [^113ya8b4] |
| Elderly patients | Reduced compensatory mechanisms [^111bpHLa] |

---

## Modern preventive strategies

- **Bipolar TURP**: Saline irrigation eliminates dilutional hyponatremia and TUR syndrome [^117FFwtZ].

- **Low-pressure irrigation**: Reduces absorption and risk of TUR syndrome [^111xKT7p].

- **Limited resection time**: Shorter procedures reduce fluid absorption [^111u3Arh].

- **Real-time monitoring**: Ethanol breath tests or fluid balance tracking detect absorption early [^115CTBLP].

---

TURP syndrome arises from **rapid absorption of hypotonic, electrolyte-free irrigation fluid**, causing dilutional hyponatremia, hypervolemia, and solute toxicity, with neurologic and cardiovascular complications; risk is highest with prolonged resection, high pressure, large prostates, and capsular perforation, and is largely preventable with bipolar saline TURP and careful technique [^113ya8b4] [^1146da8P].

### Bipolar transurethral resection of prostate: a new reference standard? [^111QLWti]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Transurethral resection of prostate is the gold standard for the surgical management of benign prostate hyperplasia. Bipolar devices allow transurethral resection of prostate with saline irrigation, which lessens water intoxication and negates the need for diathermy pad and unwanted stimulation of the obturator nerves and cardiac devices. Several randomized clinical trials compare the various bipolar devices with conventional monopolar ones. For this review, we search all peer-reviewed published literature databases and present the evidence from them to substantiate its advantages and disadvantages.

Recent Findings

Of the various types of bipolar devices, Gyrus has the longest clinical experience. Bipolar transurethral resection of prostate overcomes the shortcomings of bipolar transurethral prostate vaporization, which includes the absence of histology, postop irritative urinary symptoms and nondurable clinical outcomes. With bipolar transurethral resection of prostate, there is lesser bleeding which leads to shorter resection time and lower fluid absorption. This also enables shorter cathterization time and hospital stay. Transurethral resection syndrome has not been observed.

Summary

Bipolar transurethral resection of prostate has demonstrated similar clinical efficacy as monopolar transurethral resection of prostate with shorter catheterization and hospital stay. It eliminates the occurrence of transurethral resection syndrome and minimizes bleeding risk. Long term outcomes from these randomized clinical trials will determine the durability of its clinical efficacy and incidence of urethral strictures.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^116RuoQc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Monopolar versus bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) comparative efficacy and safety are summarized as follows: While monopolar TURP requires the use of either iso-osmolar solutions of sorbitol, mannitol, or glycine, bipolar TURP is performed in 0.9% NaCl solution. This reduces (if not eliminates) the risk for acute dilutional hyponatremia during prolonged resection, which may lead to the so- called TUR syndrome. Regarding the comparative efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of monopolar versus bipolar TURP, there are five systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 2009 and 2015 that compared bipolar TURP to monopolar TURP. None of the authors found significant differences in terms of improvements in IPSS and peak urinary flow rates at 12 months, the main efficacy parameters of interest. Time to catheter removal or catheterization time was evaluated in four pooled analyses. All four favored bipolar TURP; however, the differences in the effect estimate were highly variable as was the degree of heterogeneity. Length of stay and dilutational hyponatremia both favored bipolar TURP; however, there was close to 98% heterogeneity in each of the meta-analyses that evaluated these outcomes. Pooled data from Mamoulakis (2009), Burke (2010), Tang (2014), and Omar (2014) all supported that TUR syndrome occurred less frequently in the group that received bipolar TURP. Risk reduction for clot retention generally favored bipolar TURP. Bleeding and drops in hemoglobin seem to favor bipolar TURP but with a relatively high degree of heterogeneity in both meta-analyses. Need for blood transfusion post-operatively seems to favor bipolar TURP, although two out of six meta-analyses revealed no statistical significance. Since there are no differences in efficacy, it is reasonable to compare surgical interventions in this Guideline document with either monopolar or bipolar TURP series regarding efficacy measures.

Guideline Statement 25 — high-pressure, long-duration hydrodistension should not be offered (Evidence Strength: Grade C). High-pressure (e.g., greater than 80 to 100 cm H₂O) and long-duration (e.g., greater than 10 minutes) hydrodistension is associated with increased frequency of serious AEs without a consistent increase in benefit; three observational studies using high-pressure and/or long duration (e.g., repeated intervals of 30 minutes, 3 hours continuously) reported efficacy rates ranging from 22% to 67% and at least one case of ruptured bladder, and the Panel recommends that this treatment not be offered.

### Does an electronic cognitive aid have an effect on the management of severe gynaecological TURP syndrome? A prospective, randomised simulation study [^112Ksaqt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lack of familiarity with the content of current guidelines is a major factor associated with non-compliance by clinicians. It is conceivable that cognitive aids with regularly updated medical content can guide clinicians' task performance by evidence-based practices, even if they are unfamiliar with the actual guideline. Acute hyponatraemia as a consequence of TURP syndrome is a rare intraoperative event, and current practice guidelines have changed from slow correction to rapid correction of serum sodium levels. The primary objective of this study was to compare the management of a simulated severe gynaecological transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) syndrome under spinal anaesthesia with either: an electronic cognitive aid, or with management from memory alone. The secondary objective was to assess the clinical relevance and participant perception of the usefulness of the cognitive aid.

Methods

Anaesthetic teams were allocated to control (no cognitive aid; n = 10) or intervention (cognitive aid provided; n = 10) groups. We identified eight evidence-based management tasks for severe TURP syndrome from current guidelines and subdivided them into acute heart failure (AHF)/pulmonary oedema tasks (5) and acute hyponatraemia tasks (3). Implementation of the treatment steps was measured by scoring task items in a binary fashion (yes/no). To assess whether or not the cognitive aid had prompted a treatment step, participants from the cognitive aid group were questioned during debriefing on every single treatment step. At the end of the simulation, session participants were asked to complete a survey.

Results

Teams in the cognitive aid group considered evidence-based treatment steps significantly more often than teams of the control group (96% vs. 50% for 'AHF/pulmonary oedema' p < 0.001; 79% vs. 12% for 'acute hyponatraemia' p < 0.001). Without the cognitive aid, performance would have been comparable across both groups. Nurses, trainees, and consultants derived equal benefit from the cognitive aid.

Conclusions

The cognitive aid improved the implementation of evidence-based practices in a simulated intraoperative scenario. Cognitive aids with current medical content could help to close the translational gap between guideline publication and implementation in acute patient care. It is important that the cognitive aid should be familiar, in a format that has been used in practice and training.

### Prediction of clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome by preoperative ultrasonographic estimation of prostate weight [^114sNX8o]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The prostate size was estimated preoperatively by transrectal longitudinal ultrasonography with a real-time linear scanner and 5.0-MHz transducer (Hitachi Aloka Medical Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The maximal length (A) and maximal width (B) of the prostate were measured. Assuming that the prostate is ellipsoid in shape in patients with BPH, the volume (V) was calculated according to the formula V = [πAB²/6]. The prostate weight was assumed to be approximately equal to V as the specific gravity of prostatic tissue in patients with BPH is 1.05–1.06 g/cm³. The hand-rolling method was used to measure the resected prostate weight after TURP.

The Mann–Whitney U test and unpaired t-test were used to compare potential risk factors for TUR syndrome, including age, prostate weight, and operating time, between patients with and without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between the preoperative estimated prostate weight and the resected prostate weight. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the predictive value and optimal cutoff point of preoperative estimated prostate weight for prediction of the development of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) safety and duration — Landmark studies linked increasing complications to increasing prostate size and duration of resection and led to recommended resection time limits of 60 or 90 minutes; bipolar TURP technology using 0.9% NaCl solution has substantially improved the safety of TURP by virtually eliminating hyponatremia and significantly reducing the risk for TURP syndrome, bleeding, and transfusions, allowing resection of larger glands over longer periods without increasing risks.

### Transurethral resection syndrome in elderly patients: a retrospective observational study [^111bpHLa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is common in elderly males. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a standard surgical procedure for the management of benign prostatic obstructions. Non-conductive irrigation fluid is required during the use of monopolar electric resectoscope to clear the operating field. This hypotonic, electrolyte-free, nonconductive distension solution contains no electrolytes, and excessive absorption of it can cause fluid overload and dilutional hyponatremia. The associated adverse effects arising in both the cardiovascular and nervous systems are known as transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome. TUR syndrome has a multifactorial pathophysiology that is now better understood but still remains a risk.

Several studies over the last 20 years have shown mortality rates of 0.2–0.8%, and TURP is still associated with significant morbidity. The most frequent complication of conventional TURP is perioperative bleeding, which, in a significant number of cases, may necessitate blood transfusion. The most serious complication of conventional monopolar TURP is TUR syndrome, the frequency of which varies considerably in the literature, ranging from 0.18 to 10.9%. The symptoms of TUR syndrome are central nervous disturbances such as dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, and apnea, and circulatory abnormalities such as hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, and arrhythmia. Anesthesiologists need to remain vigilant for such signs of TUR syndrome during surgery. Left undiagnosed, this syndrome can lead to lung or cerebral edema. Therefore, spinal anesthesia is often recommended for TURP procedures so that early signs of neurological deterioration can be detected.

TUR syndrome can occur during other operations, including transcervical resection of the endometrium, TUR of bladder tumors, cystoscopy, arthroscopy, and vesical ultrasonic lithotripsy. However, TURP has an extremely high incidence of TUR syndrome. Theoretical risk factors are opened prostatic sinuses, high irrigation pressures, lengthy resection, and hypotonic irrigation solutions. According to a past report, 77% of patients undergoing TURP had significant pre-existing medical conditions. Increased morbidity was found in patients with a resection time greater than 90 min, gland masses greater than 45 g, acute urinary retention, age greater than 80 years, and in those of African descent. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors related to TUR syndrome in the elderly.

### Sudden occurence of hypotension and bradycardia during greenlight laser transurethral resection of prostate: case report of two cases [^117ANHrY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Greenlight laser transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) is a standard surgical method used to treat patients with prostate gland enlargement, it is safe and effective.

Case Presentation

We report two cases of sudden occurence of hypotension and bradycardia during greenlight laser TURP. Two patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy were scheduled for greenlight laser TURP under spinal anesthesia. Hypotension and bradycardia were suddenly occurred during the operation. The blood gas analysis revealed no hyponatremia (indicating TURP syndrome) or anemia (indicating hemorrhage). Operation was suspended and inotropic agents were administrated intravenous immediately, then blood pressure and heart rate increased to normal level within some minutes. The patients were discharged from hospital without any complications. We considered parasympathetic reflex was occurred during greenlight laser TURP.

Conclusion

Apart from TURP syndrome, hemorrhage, bladder perforation and high spinal anesthesia, the parasympathetic reflex which is caused by operative process can also induce hypotension and bradycardia during TURP.

### Change in serum sodium level predicts clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome: a retrospective review [^112fDbiA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of prostate gland enlargement increases with age, occurring in an estimated 50% of males at age 60 years and an estimated 90% at 85 years. Prostatic ultrasonography is used to assess the weight, shape, and structure of the prostate gland and to determine optimal treatment. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a standard surgical method used to treat patients with prostate gland enlargement. Our use of monopolar electrodes as electrical cautery for excision increases the necessity of using nonconductive irrigation fluid. These fluids, however, contain no electrolytes, allowing their absorption into the blood stream. This may result in dilutional hyponatremia, which may result in cardiovascular and/or neurological manifestations. In general, transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome is defined as a serum sodium concentration ≤ 125 mmol/l combined with clinical cardiovascular and neurological manifestations. Based on this definition, the rate of TUR syndrome has been found to range between 0.5% and 10.5%. Experientially, however, symptoms of TUR syndrome may occur in patients with serum sodium levels > 125 mmol/l.

Theoretical risk factors for TUR syndrome include surgical release of the prostatic sinus, high irrigation pressure, prolonged operation time, and use of hypotonic perfusate. Moreover, the incidence of TUR syndrome may be significantly higher if surgery takes longer than 90 minutes, if the prostate gland weight is over 45 g, or if patients have acute dysuria, are over 80 years old, or of African race. This study investigated whether intra- and post-operative changes in serum sodium concentrations could predict the clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome.

### Is absorption of irrigation fluid a problem in thulium laser vaporization of the prostate? A prospective investigation using the expired breath ethanol test [^1131GLhe]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent entity in elderly men. If medical treatment fails, monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is still considered as the standard treatment. The proportion of high-risk patients with cardiac comorbidities increases and TUR-P goes along with a relevant perioperative risk. Especially large volume influx of irrigation fluid and transurethral resection syndrome (TUR syndrome) represent serious threats to these patients. Using isotonic saline as irrigation fluid like in transurethral laser vaporization (TUV-P), TUR syndrome can be prevented. However, no prospective trial has ever assessed occurrence or extent of irrigation fluid absorption in Thulium Laser TUV-P.

Methods/Design

This is a single-center prospective trial, investigating, if absorption of irrigation fluid occurs during Thulium Laser TUV-P by expired breath ethanol test. The expired breath ethanol technique is an established method of investigating intraoperative absorption of irrigation fluid: A tracer amount of ethanol is added to the irrigation fluid and the absorption of irrigation fluid can be calculated by measuring the expiratory ethanol concentrations of the patient with an alcohol breathalyzer. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing TUV-P at our tertiary referral center are included into the trial. Absorption volume of irrigation fluid during Thulium Laser TUV-P is defined as primary endpoint. Pre- to postoperative changes in bladder diaries, biochemical and hematological laboratory findings, duration of operation and standardized questionnaires are assessed as secondary outcome measures.

Discussion

The aim of this study is to assess the safety of Thulium Laser TUV-P in regard to absorption of irrigation fluid.

Regarding surgical interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia, more specifically with respect to transurethral resection, CUA 2022 guidelines recommend to offer monopolar

### Sudden occurence of hypotension and bradycardia during greenlight laser transurethral resection of prostate: case report of two cases [^114QoKs1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

The hypotension and bradycardia in our cases were not caused by TURP syndrome. First, TURP syndrome can cause hypervolemia and hyponatraemia, but it is rare when normal saline is used as irrigation fluid. In our cases, normal saline is used as irrigation fluid, and there is no manifestation of hypervolemia and hyponatraemia. Second, TURP syndrome can cause a wide variety of symptoms including asymptomatic hyponatremia, ECG changes, fatigue, vomiting, confusion, visual loss, coma and death. So the change of mental state may be the first sign, but it was not appeared in our cases. Third, we didn't give any treatment of TURP syndrome such as sedation, diuresis and sodium supplement, the cases recovered. Finally, TURP syndrome is defined as serum sodium concentration ≤ 125 mmol/l, but it was normal in our cases.

The intravesical explosion during TURP can cause bradycardia and hypotension, accompany with nausea, abdominal pain and developed confusion. But this complication usually manifested as a "pop" and can be identified by the urologists and anesthesiologists. The bladder perforation can be observed through cystoscope. So the hypotension and bradycardia in our cases were not caused by bladder perforation.

Because the Hct was stable during operation, the hypotension and bradycardia were not caused by hemorrhage.

### Transurethral resection of the prostate revisited and updated [^111pijcf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Electrosurgical transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate (TURP) has dominated symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (s-BPH) surgical treatment for almost a century. We analysed recent TURP publications, with emphasis on durability, morbidity, new technology advantages, future generation training and malignant disease.

Recent Findings

TURP has declined due to medical therapy, but transcends other surgical challengers by proven outcomes durability over a decade. Adopting the modified-Clavien system may aid future morbidity comparisons. Properly used bipolar technology reduces major bleeding and seemingly abolishes TUR syndrome, but requires further study in anticoagulated patients. Residents are disturbingly short of TURP exposure, consequently experiencing more complications. Solutions include switching to ablative laser prostatectomy (which may carry higher long-term retreatment rates), adoption of bipolar technology, or simulator development and implementation. Concurrently performed transurethral resection of bladder tumor-TURP seems oncologically acceptable (in selected cases); incidentally detected significant prostate cancer at TURP may have declined, whereas TURP for prostate cancer may indicate the need for earlier androgen deprivation.

Summary

TURP is still rightly the dominant, most widely performed, versatile and cost-effective surgical treatment for s-BPH, reducing morbidity further with technical and technological developments. A better evidence base is required for newer technologies through large well designed multicentre-multinational randomized controlled trials incorporating standardized morbidity and long-term outcomes reporting.

Purpose Of Review

Transurethral resection of the prostate remains the gold standard treatment for benign prostatic obstruction. Owing to the significant morbidity traditionally associated with the procedure, a large number of expensive, high-energy alternative treatments have been developed, which have enjoyed varying degrees of success. At the same time, transurethral resection of the prostate has evolved into a safer operation whilst maintaining its excellent efficacy. This review aims to outline the major advances that have occurred recently in transurethral resection of the prostate.

Recent Findings

Optimizing each stage of transurethral resection of the prostate can result in reduced morbidity. Preoperative treatment with oral antiandrogens and 5-reductase inhibitors appears to reduce intraoperative bleeding, appropriate prophylactic antibiotic regimens reduce postoperative infection rates, improved instrumentation and diathermy delivery can reduce intraoperative bleeding and hence reduce postoperative irrigation requirements, and alcohol monitoring of irrigant absorption can eliminate transurethral resection syndrome. Careful patient selection, meticulous surgical technique combined with an aggressive postoperative irrigation and catheter removal policy can result in transurethral resection of the prostate being performed safely on a day-case basis.

Summary

Whilst our attention has been distracted by the many alternative treatments brought to the market over the past decade or so, transurethral resection of the prostate has been undergoing a quiet evolution. With fine tuning of all aspects of the patient journey we can now offer a procedure with excellent long-term efficacy combined with reduced morbidity and inpatient stay.

### Dural sac cross-sectional area is a highly effective parameter for spinal anesthesia in geriatric patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate: a prospective, double blinded, randomized study [^113Ue42U]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia has a high incidence rate about 60% among males aged more than 60 years; whereas the rate is up to 90% among patients around 80 years. The high comorbidity rate also directly affecting perioperative morbidity and mortality after TURP.

Because of the pain signal from bladder distension travels along the T11 to L2 sympathetic fibers. The stretch sensation of the bladder is carried by the S2 to S4 parasympathetic fibers. Considering this innervation, the height of the regional blockade level up to T10 is sufficient for TURP operation. A higher level of blockade may mask the pain upon perforation of the prostatic capsule. Intrathecal anesthesia is optimal choice for TURP, but the height should not cross the T10 level. The factors such as concentration and volume are the major factors affecting the distribution of local anesthetics after spinal injection.

Hypotension is the major risk after the spinal injection. The systemic vascular resistance may decrease by 25% in elderly patients, whereas it may decrease only by 15–18% in normovolemic healthy patients. Because the functional of critical organ and compensate ability for stresses are decreased, it is harmful for geriatric patients to inject more local anesthetics. Thus, it is important to optimize the dosage of spinal anesthetics for geriatric patients.

Spinal anesthesia can reduce the stress response relate to surgery, and recognize the TUR syndrome early. The patient can complain of shoulder or periumbilical pain with spinal anesthesia level is less than T10. It is necessary to diagnosis and effective management the TUR syndrome timely. In a case report, the authors emphasize that it is very important to diagnosis and treatment the TURP syndrome early, the patient have not been found developed hyponatremia until decreased to 90 mmol/L under general anesthesia during a TURP procedure. The patients can clearly describe the early features of TUR syndrome when patient is conscious, so spinal anesthesia is therefore desirable to facilitate early recognition.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Acute severe iatrogenic hyponatremia [^113ya8b4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

C. Rapid correction of sodium with hypertonic saline.

TURP syndrome is a type of severe iatrogenic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mmol/L) that can occur during endoscopic urologic or gynecologic procedures requiring continuous irrigation. Hypotonic solutions (1.5% glycine, 3% sorbitol, or 5% mannitol) are required for the use of unipolar cautery because they are non-conducting. However, in rare cases, they can be rapidly absorbed through exposed venous plexuses, causing hyponatremia and fluid overload. Risk factors for the development of TURP syndrome include increased operative time, type of anesthesia (general anesthesia vs. spinal), increased vascularity and bleeding, visceral perforation, and pressure of irrigating fluid.

Several strategies to reduce the risk of TURP syndrome have been proposed. The most effective is to perform the operation with bipolar cautery, thus allowing irrigation with isotonic saline. Studies have shown an almost negligible change in serum sodium using such solutions. However, fluid overload and congestive heart failure can still occur if more than 2.5 L of fluid is absorbed systemically If unipolar cautery is required, operating room staff can estimate the fluid deficit in real time by measuring the volume of irrigation used and subtracting the volume removed by suction. A fluid deficit threshold of 1 to 1.5 L has been found to significantly increase the risk for developing neurologic symptoms due to TURP syndrome. However, this technique can be challenging as blood and urine mix with the irrigation, complicating accurate estimates. If spinal anesthesia is employed, the patient's neurologic status can be monitored intraoperatively; if general anesthesia is performed, the patient may not manifest symptoms until arrival in recovery. Our patient was under general anesthesia and became progressively hypoxic during the second half of the operation, providing early warning that he absorbed a significant amount of fluid and was developing pulmonary edema. Indeed, in the post-anesthesia care unit, his respiratory rate was 31 and he required 10 L non-rebreather oxygen mask to achieve O₂ sat > 92%. His chest X-ray was notable for diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema.

### Change in serum sodium level predicts clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome: a retrospective review [^114Z9ivb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Postoperative serum sodium levels were examined 3 h after the end of surgery. None of the patients received postoperative diuretics or sodium chloride. Postoperative serum sodium levels recovered relatively easily. As irrigation fluid contains no electrolytes, the absorption of this fluid into the blood from the bladder can lead to hyponatremia. Water mainly filters into urine automatically in postoperative patients. However, some patients experienced reductions in sodium levels due to abnormal volume shift. Our previous study found that continuous drainage of irrigation fluid through a suprapubic cystostomy was an important risk factor for TUR syndrome in older patients. Although this continuous drainage was designed to remove debris, blood, and clots from the operating field, it may accelerate dilutional hyponatremia. In the patients' backgrounds, there was a significant difference between the two groups in preoperatively-estimated prostate gland size. Prostate gland size was preoperatively estimated using ultrasonography, which showed that the patients in the symptomatic group had larger prostates than those in the asymptomatic group; this is in agreement with our previous findings.

The major limitation of this study was the inability to obtain frequent blood samples, as blood was not continuously sampled during surgery. In addition, clinical manifestations may have differed in anesthetic and nursing charts, because the detection of restlessness and nausea is subjective. Cardiovascular manifestations and pulmonary compromise required aggressive interventions such as converting from local to general anesthesia, which may explain our lack of severe neurological scores.

### A randomized comparison between three types of irrigating fluids during transurethral resection in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1113iMJG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Central nervous system changes, circulatory and electrolyte imbalances are the main complications of endoscopic transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) which is known as transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome, which occurs as result of excessive absorption of irrigating fluid. We compare glycine 1.5% versus glucose 5% and normal saline 0.9% as irrigating solutions during TURP in patients with moderate to severe bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Methods

Three hundred sixty patients with symptomatic BPH were randomized into a prospective, controlled trial comparing the three irrigation modalities. One-hundred twenty patients used glycine 1.5% solution as irrigating fluid (glycine group), 120 patients used glucose 5% solution (glucose group) and 120 patients used normal saline 0.9% solution (saline group). Patient's demographics, operation time, hospital stay, postoperative amino acid glycine assay, postoperative serum cardiac troponin I and perioperative complications were noted.

Results

No difference was found between the groups in the immediate postoperative levels of hemoglobin and hematocrite. A high glycine level was associated with the TUR syndrome. Seventeen patients had TUR syndrome; all were in glycine group and they had the highest postoperative amino acid glycine levels. Slight increase in serum sodium (142.6 ± 12.6 mmol/l) was detected in saline group. Transient Hyperglycemia (170 ± 35.9 mg/dl) and hypokalemia (3.67 ± 0.92 mmol/l) occurred in the immediate postoperative period in the glucose group.

Conclusion

Endoscopic TURP performed using either glucose 5% or saline 0.9% irrigating solution during and after surgery is associated with lower incidence of TUR syndrome, lower catheterization period, shorter hospital stay and no cardiac toxicity in comparison with glycine 1.5% solution.

Trial Registration

This clinical trail had been approved and registered in PACT Registry; with identification number for the registry is ATMR2010010001793131.

### Bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy after transurethral prostatic resection: a case report [^113fUUiB]. BMC Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Postoperative visual loss may be the result of several different mechanisms, including anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, cortical blindness, retinal artery occlusion, and ophthalmic venous obstruction.

Rarely, ischemic optic neuropathy may present as an early and extremely serious perioperative complication that can involve both optic nerves simultaneously. Stevens et al. suggested that prolonged controlled hypotension and intraoperative anemia could increase the risk of ischemic optic neuropathy in patients with predisposing factors.

Another common entity after transurethral prostatic resection is the TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) syndrome. Endoscopy of the genitourinary tract requires the use of an irrigating fluid containing glycine 1.5% and exposes patients to adverse events related to absorption of the irrigating fluid, referred to as the TURP syndrome. This syndrome is caused by dilutional hyponatremia (serum sodium, < 125 mEq/L) and is characterized by mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, bradycardia, and visual disturbances. In our case, the serum sodium was between 140 and 141 mEq/L and the TURP syndrome was then not considered a diagnosis.

Our patient presented with AION 4 days after TPR, preceded by episodes of transient diplopia and blurred vision. Bilateral AION associated with an area of retinal infarction immediately off the left optic disc (figure 2) could suggest a vasculitic mechanism, such as giant cell arteritis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were not elevated and no jaw claudication or scalp tenderness was found. In addition, there was no temporal artery abnormality (tenderness or reduced pulsation).

A case of AION after rotator cuff surgery was reported recently. The patient had hyperlipidaemia and anomalous optic nerves. The only risk factor during surgery was prolonged hypotension. The mean arterial pressure decreased by 41.6%. In our case, the combination of anomalous nerves, hypotension, and anemia could be the risk factors for AION.

Bilateral and simultaneous acute ischemic optic neuropathy may be a rare but devastating surgical complication. Medical personnel should be aware that the combination of anemia and hypotension may increase the risk of AION in the postoperative period after TPR, and that transient episodes of diplopia and blurred vision after TPR may herald that process.

### Bipolar versus monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction [^1154uZD4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a well-established surgical method for treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). This has traditionally been provided as monopolar TURP (MTURP), but morbidity associated with MTURP has led to the introduction of other surgical techniques. In bipolar TURP (BTURP), energy is confined between electrodes at the site of the resectoscope, allowing the use of physiological irrigation medium. There remains uncertainty regarding differences between these surgical methods in terms of patient outcomes.

Objectives

To compare the effects of bipolar and monopolar TURP.

Search Methods

A comprehensive systematic electronic literature search was carried out up to 19 March 2019 via CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. Handsearching of abstract proceedings of major urological conferences and of reference lists of included trials, systematic reviews, and health technology assessment reports was undertaken to identify other potentially eligible studies. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared monopolar and bipolar TURP in men (> 18 years) for management of LUTS secondary to BPO.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed eligible RCTs for risk of bias. Statistical analyses were undertaken according to the statistical guidelines presented in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The quality of evidence (QoE) was rated according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

A total of 59 RCTs with 8924 participants were included. The mean age of included participants ranged from 59.0 to 74.1 years. Mean prostate volume ranged from 39 mL to 82.6 mL. Primary outcomes BTURP probably results in little to no difference in urological symptoms, as measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12 months on a scale of 0 to 35, with higher scores reflecting worse symptoms (mean difference (MD) -0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.09; participants = 2531; RCTs = 16; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence (CoE), downgraded for study limitations), compared to MTURP. BTURP probably results in little to no difference in bother, as measured by health-related quality of life (HRQoL) score at 12 months on a scale of 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting greater bother (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.02; participants = 2004; RCTs = 11; I² = 53%; moderate CoE, downgraded for study limitations), compared to MTURP. BTURP probably reduces transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome events slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30; participants = 6745; RCTs = 44; I² = 0%; moderate CoE, downgraded for study limitations), compared to MTURP. This corresponds to 20 fewer TUR syndrome events per 1000 participants (95% CI 22 fewer to 17 fewer). Secondary outcomes BTURP may carry a similar risk of urinary incontinence at 12 months (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; participants = 751; RCTs = 4; I² = 0%; low CoE, downgraded for study limitations and imprecision), compared to MTURP. This corresponds to four fewer events of urinary incontinence per 1000 participants (95% CI five fewer to 16 more). BTURP probably slightly reduces blood transfusions (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.59; participants = 5727; RCTs = 38; I² = 0%; moderate CoE, downgraded for study limitations), compared to MTURP. This corresponds to 28 fewer events of blood transfusion per 1000 participants (95% CI 34 fewer to 20 fewer). BTURP may result in similar rates of re-TURP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.40; participants = 652; RCTs = 6; I² = 0%; low CoE, downgraded for study limitations and imprecision). This corresponds to one more re-TURP per 1000 participants (95% CI 19 fewer to 48 more). Erectile function as measured by the International Index of Erectile Function score (IIEF-5) at 12 months on a scale from 5 to 25, with higher scores reflecting better erectile function, appears to be similar (MD 0.88, 95% CI -0.56 to 2.32; RCTs = 3; I² = 68%; moderate CoE, downgraded for study limitations) for the two approaches.

Authors' Conclusions

BTURP and MTURP probably improve urological symptoms, both to a similar degree. BTURP probably reduces both TUR syndrome and postoperative blood transfusion slightly compared to MTURP. The impact of both procedures on erectile function is probably similar. The moderate certainty of evidence available for the primary outcomes of this review suggests that there is no need for further RCTs comparing BTURP and MTURP.

### Acute severe iatrogenic hyponatremia [^112LWkx3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the neurologic symptoms seen in acute hyponatremia are due more to hypo-osmolality rather than hyponatremia itself. Low serum osmolality leads to cerebral edema, and in severe cases can result in brain herniation. However, since the irrigating fluids are not pure water, the serum osmolality is usually not as low as might be expected given the degree of hyponatremia. In this case, the patient's serum osmolality was 268 mOsm/kg; this could explain why he did not exhibit neurologic symptoms despite an extremely low serum sodium of 95 mmol/L. Of note, when glycine is used for irrigation, there may be independent neurotoxic effects related to its metabolites.

While the treatment of chronic hyponatremia requires a slow increase in serum sodium levels to avoid the feared risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome, hyponatremia secondary to TURP syndrome is acute. Since the brain has not had time to equilibrate, rapid correction is safe and especially indicated if the patient is exhibiting neurologic symptoms. If the hyponatremia is mild and the patient is asymptomatic, no aggressive intervention other than monitoring may be required. For severe TURP syndrome, 3% hypertonic saline given as a bolus and/or infusion is useful to correct hyponatremia and to counteract the osmotic diuresis caused by glycine, sorbitol, or mannitol, which further draws sodium into the urine. Frequent monitoring in an intensive care unit setting is recommended to assess neurologic changes and ensure the rapid correction of sodium. Other treatment modalities include the administration of loop diuretics if there are any clinical signs of volume overload such as pulmonary edema. Our patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with hourly neurologic monitoring and hourly whole blood sodium checks. He received 20 mg furosemide, with a repeat dose the following morning; he was able to wean from 10 L non-rebreather mask to room air overnight. In addition, he was given two 125 mL boluses of 3% hypertonic saline and was placed on a 3% hypertonic saline infusion overnight, at a rate that was titrated to achieve a slow and steady increase in sodium. Throughout the night, he had intermittent episodes of confusion that were attributed to mild cerebral edema, but never had a depressed mental status. The following morning, his intravenous line was found to have infiltrated, so the rise in sodium was slower than planned (figure 1). Twenty hours later, his sodium was 135 mmol/L (2 mmol/L/hour rise) and he was completely neurologically intact.

### Analysis of the efficacy of transurethral resection of prostate combined with transurethral incision of bladder neck when treating patients with small volume benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111pRpij]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of dysuria in middle-aged and elderly men. In recent decades, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has become a widely adopted and effective surgical treatment for this condition. However, some younger patients also present with severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) despite having prostate volumes below 30 mL, a condition classified as small-volume benign prostatic hyperplasia (SBPH). Studies have shown that SBPH is frequently associated with bladder neck fibrosis, which limits the efficacy of conventional TURP and can significantly impair quality of life if not properly managed.

SBPH presents a unique clinical challenge, as obstruction is driven more by fibrosis than glandular hyperplasia. Although TURP is considered the gold standard for larger prostates, its success in SBPH is often hindered by a higher risk of postoperative bladder neck contracture. Glandular hyperplasia in these cases often reflects smooth muscle fibrosis rather than nodular overgrowth. Several contributing factors have been implicated, including chronic inflammation (e.g. cystitis glandularis), recurrent prostatitis, and prior prostate treatments — all of which may lead to fibrotic remodeling and bladder neck obstruction.

Although transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) is guideline-recommended for prostates < 30 mL, it may be suboptimal for SBPH patients with bladder neck fibrosis. TUIP addresses lateral lobe obstruction but not the fibrotic annular narrowing of the bladder neck, which is central to SBPH pathophysiology. To overcome this limitation, we implemented a combined approach: TURP to address glandular hyperplasia and transurethral incision of the bladder neck (TUIBN) to directly release fibrotic obstruction.

This combination (TURP + TUIBN) has shown promise in previous reports, reducing the incidence of bladder neck contracture more effectively than TUIP alone. Histopathological evidence supports this approach, highlighting the predominance of smooth muscle fibrosis in SBPH and the need for targeted intervention at the bladder neck. Given the shortcomings of TUIP in this setting, TURP + TUIBN offers a more anatomically and pathophysiologically tailored strategy.

In this study, we conducted a clinical case-control analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TURP combined with TUIBN in treating SBPH. We aimed to determine whether this approach improves symptom scores, urodynamic outcomes, and reduces long-term complications such as bladder neck contracture.

### Is absorption of irrigation fluid a problem in thulium laser vaporization of the prostate? A prospective investigation using the expired breath ethanol test [^115CTBLP]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent entity, affecting over 50% of men older than 60 years. The clinical picture of the disease includes lower urinary tract symptoms such as interrupted and weak urinary stream, nocturia, urgency, leaking and even sexual dysfunction in some individuals. Medical therapy is usually the first-line treatment. However, the efficacy of drugs like alpha-blockers is limited, and as disease progresses, more invasive treatment options have to be taken into consideration.

In cases with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is still the standard treatment. Especially in frail patients, conventional TUR-P is associated with relevant and potentially deleterious complications.

The proportion of elderly patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy with cardiac comorbidities increases. Especially major bleeding and transurethral resection syndrome (TUR syndrome) put these high-risk patients at a relevant perioperative risk.

TUR syndrome is caused by absorption of electrolyte-free irrigating fluid (which has to be used in monopolar TUR-P), and consists of symptoms of the circulatory and nervous systems. Mild forms are common and often go undiagnosed, while severe forms of the TUR syndrome are potentially life-threatening.

Using isotonic saline, like in bipolar TUR-P and TUV-P, TUR syndrome can be prevented. Moreover, these techniques were thought to completely prevent influx of irrigation fluid into the vascular system due to their excellent coagulation properties.

However, significant intraoperative fluid absorption has been demonstrated in bipolar TUR-P and with the Greenlight-Laser. The authors concluded, that these techniques should be used with caution in patients with significant cardiovascular comorbidities.

Ethanol monitoring was first used in the late 1980's as an alternative to traditional methods of measuring fluid absorption (i.e. measuring volumetric fluid balance and serum sodium concentration). These techniques, however, are bothersome and must be carried out meticulously to yield a valid Figure of absorption. If ethanol is added to the irrigation fluid as a tracer, the volume of fluid absorbed can be estimated from the amount of ethanol measured in the patient's exspired breath.

### Transurethral resection syndrome in elderly patients: a retrospective observational study [^115KsZbg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

As many previous studies showed, significant risk factors for TUR syndrome were duration of operation > 1.5 h and weight of resected mass > 45 g. Despite all technical advances, resection speeds of between 0.5 and 0.9 g/min have not shown significant improvement. In contrast, Akata et al. reported that changes in serum sodium during TURP correlated with rapid absorption in cases when the capsular veins and the prostate sinus are injured, but not with resection times. Volume of plasma substitute ≥ 500 mL during the operation was found to be a significant risk factor for TUR syndrome in the present study. Plasma substitute contains colloids with a slightly higher osmotic pressure than Ringer's solution or saline and it is administered from the beginning of the surgery against hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia. Theoretically, excessive serum dilution should have been avoided.

More importantly, continuous drainage of irrigation fluid through a suprapubic cystostomy was found to be another risk factor in the present study. Continuous fluid drainage is useful for removing debris and blood in the operating field and in removing postoperative blood clots. This allows surgeons to continue the procedure without interruption. However, according to our observations, a number of patients had abdominal swelling owing to irrigation fluid leaking from the drainage point into the extraperitoneal space and abdominal cavity. Interestingly, Hahn et al. reported on evacuation of irrigation fluid from the bladder. Keeping the intravesical pressure below 2 kPa is the best strategy for reducing fluid absorption. The drainage catheter may not have been effective because it had a small diameter. Extracellular electrolytes diffuse into the deposited irrigating fluid. Abdominal pain, which may radiate to the shoulder, is a common first sign of extravasation. Then, even if a suprapubic cystostomy should be inserted into the extraperitoneal area, the peritoneum can absorb large amounts of leaked irrigation fluid. This can induce hyponatremia in the patients. This fall in serum electrolytes is commonly followed by hypovolemia, with bradycardia and arterial hypotension. Hyponatremia is most pronounced 2–4 h later, but this extravasation may go undetected until the next day.

### Change in serum sodium level predicts clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome: a retrospective review [^116LotEW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study defined clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome based on the appearance of cardiovascular and neurological manifestations, and assessed these symptoms relative to changes in serum sodium level. Because of the difficulty in scoring cardiovascular manifestations of TUR syndrome, a neurological score system that could indicate the symptomatic severity of hyponatremia was used.

Our ROC analyses found that decreases in serum sodium levels > 7.4 mmol/l and > 7.0% were predictive of the clinical manifestation of TUR syndrome. As normal serum sodium concentrations are about 135–145 mmol/l, clinical manifestations may occur even in patients with serum sodium levels > 125 mmol/l; this indicates that symptoms of TUR syndrome may develop even when serum sodium levels remain within a normal range. In addition, although the outcomes of TURP under general and local anesthesia were previously reported to be similar, patients who undergo TURP under general anesthesia may more readily develop dilutional hyponatremia owing to the slow absorption of irrigation fluid into blood vessels. Therefore, a long-acting diuretic able to maintain serum sodium levels, such as tolvaptan, may be optimal for preventing TUR syndrome.

Logistic regression analysis identified the risk factors of symptoms occurring as serum sodium level variables, operation time more than or equal to 90 min, and presence of continuous drainage from bladder. We evaluated three predictive variables of serum sodium concentration. A sodium level less than or equal to 125 mmol/l had the highest accuracy, therefore, it was the most appropriate predictive parameter. Change in sodium level and percent change in sodium level had similar predictive values.

In this study, we detected several neurological manifestations of TUR syndrome, including restlessness, nausea, vomiting, pain, and confusion. Visual changes, seizures, and encephalopathy caused by cerebral edema have been previously reported, but were not observed in this study. Pain was the most difficult symptom to categorize as being caused by hyponatremia, as it may be caused by the surgery itself. Patients reported vague abdominal pains, accompanied by restlessness or nausea.

### Prediction of clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome by preoperative ultrasonographic estimation of prostate weight [^113g5LcG]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

This is the first study to investigate the relationship between prostate weight and the development of clinical manifestations of TUR, regardless of serum sodium levels. Preoperative ultrasonography is commonly used to diagnose BPH and to estimate prostate weight. In this study, there was a strong correlation between the preoperative estimated prostate weight on ultrasonography and the resected prostate weight, indicating that preoperative estimation of prostate weight by ultrasonography may be useful for predicting the risk of TUR syndrome. The optimal cutoff value of estimated prostate weight to predict the development of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome was 75 g. However, there is also a risk of TUR syndrome when resecting prostates of lower weights. Akata et al. reported that changes in the serum sodium level during TURP correlated with incision of the capsular veins and prostatic sinuses, but not with operation time. It is important to carefully monitor patients for the development of TUR syndrome, especially patients with larger prostates, and we recommend measurement of the serum sodium level during and after surgery.

In this study, continuous drainage of irrigation fluid through a suprapubic cystostomy was found to be a risk factor for TUR syndrome. Our previous study also found this to be an important risk factor for TUR syndrome in older patients. Such continuous drainage of irrigation fluid facilitates the removal of debris, blood, and clots from the operating field. Blood clots and debris may obstruct the drainage catheter, thereby raising the fluid pressure and increasing the volume absorbed. Drainage catheters with small diameters may be less effective than catheters with larger diameters. A number of patients in this study were noted to have abdominal swelling caused by leakage of irrigation fluid through the drainage site into the extraperitoneal space and abdominal cavity. When this occurs, extracellular electrolytes diffuse into the accumulated irrigation fluid, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia and increasing the risk of TUR syndrome. The hyponatremia is most pronounced at 2–4 h after surgery, but may go undetected until the next day.

Inconsistencies were occasionally found between the narrative recommendations and those depicted in the guideline algorithms. For example, the EAU textually recommends transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) only for prostate sizes of 30–80 cc, but the visual algorithm suggests TURP for prostates smaller than 30 cc.

Furthermore, recommendations were not simply binary as 'recommended' or 'not recommended'; they exist on a spectrum where some procedures were preferred, differed in levels of evidence, or were provisionally endorsed despite being 'under investigation'.

The substantial interpretive latitude meant that not all authors uniformly interpreted the recommendations, necessitating in-depth discussions and the insertion of clarifying comments and cross-references to arrive at a consensus and an intelligible algorithm (Fig. 1).

### Transurethral resection syndrome in elderly patients: a retrospective observational study [^113FzTQ2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, weight of resected mass > 45 g, volume of plasma substitute ≥ 500 ml, and continuous irrigation were associated with a significantly increased risk for TUR syndrome. Our results suggest that the use of a plasma substitute and continuous irrigation through a suprapubic cystostomy must be avoided during TURP procedures in the elderly to reduce the risk of TUR syndrome.

### Bipolar versus monopolar TURP: a prospective controlled study at two urology centers [^113Jwmh8]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

We compared bipolar and monopolar TURP in a prospective controlled study at two urology centers. The objective of the study was to establish whether there were differences between the two methods with regard to frequency of the transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome, amount of fluid absorbed during surgery, risk of hemorrhage, duration of postoperative catheterization and duration of hospitalization. The duration of surgery, improvement in maximum flow rate (Q-max), residual urine volume, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Quality of Life (QoL) score were also compared. Overall, our study showed that there were no major differences between bipolar and monopolar TURP. During follow-up, the clinical efficacy of bipolar TURP has been maintained to the same degree as with the traditional method, with no significant differences for Q-max, IPSS and QoL scores after 1 year. Although the risk of developing TUR syndrome seemed to be smaller with bipolar resection (serum sodium change bipolar versus monopolar: +1.2 versus -0.1 mmol/L), the bleeding tendency with both methods was the same (14.0 g/L hemoglobin loss after 1 day in both groups). On the basis of our findings, we think that the monopolar technique has still a place in TURP.

### TURP syndrome and severe hyponatremia under general anaesthesia [^111PB9Gu]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) syndrome is a complication characterised by symptoms changing from an asymptomatic hyponatremic state to convulsions, coma and death due to absorption of irrigation fluid during TURP. The syndrome appears to be related to the amount of fluid that enters the circulation via the blood vessels in the resection area. The first step in the course of action for therapy is to control bleeding and suspend the operation. In the case presented, we aimed to emphasise the importance of an early diagnosis and treatment of TURP syndrome in a patient that developed hyponatremia (90 mmol/l) while under general anaesthesia during a TURP procedure. In addition, multiple cystoscopic applications in the same session may facilitate development of the TURP syndrome.

### Analysis of the efficacy of transurethral resection of prostate combined with transurethral incision of bladder neck when treating patients with small volume benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111oqxug]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Since the clinical development of TURP, it has gradually replaced open surgery and has become the "gold standard" to treat BPH. However, TURP still has many deficiencies: the absorption of too much irrigation fluid during the operation leads to blood volume expansion, which is easy to cause electrical resection syndrome (TURS). The incidence rate is about 2%, and with the increase of operation time, the risk of occurrence increases; Difficult to stop bleeding, easy to perforate the capsule, about 2–5% of patients require intraoperative blood transfusion; postoperative complications such as bladder spasm, urinary incontinence, urethral stricture, retrograde ejaculation dysfunction, etc.

According to the characteristics and pathogenesis of SBPH, the newly proposed addition of bladder neck incision (TURP + TUIBN) on the basis of TURP is undoubtedly a more targeted treatment, and it has been proved to have better therapeutic effect. While the EAU guidelines advocate TUIP for small-volume BPH, our study highlights the need to tailor surgical approaches to underlying pathology. In patients with concomitant bladder neck fibrosis a feature poorly addressed by TUIP alone TURP + TUIBN demonstrated superior urodynamic outcomes and reduced long-term complications. This supports the rationale for combining resection with targeted incision in select cases, particularly where fibrosis is a dominant contributor to obstruction. These findings also confirm the safety of the TURP + TUIBN technique. Despite adding an incision step, complication rates including bleeding, capsular perforation, transient LUTS, and incontinence were not significantly different from standard TURP. The low incidence of adverse intraoperative events further supports TURP + TUIBN as a safe surgical option in patients with small-volume BPH and bladder neck fibrosis.

### Is there an increase in genitourinary toxicity in patients treated with transurethral resection of the prostate and radiotherapy? A systematic review [^112mwww7]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is considered by some as a risk factor for genitourinary (GU) toxicity after radiotherapy (RT). However, there are conflicting results regarding the interaction between RT and TURP with respect to GU toxicity. The purpose of this report is to review the published data concerning TURP before or after RT and its effect on urinary complication.

Methods and Materials

A systematic literature review based on database searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, Ovid, and Chochrane Library. The eligibility criteria of final review were (1) definitive RT for prostate cancer is reported; (2) comparison of GU toxicities between patients with and without TURP is reported; (3) minimum 5 patients after TURP are included.

Results

Twelve articles regarding overall GU toxicity, 15 articles regarding urinary incontinence, and 13 articles regarding urinary or bladder neck stricture met eligibility criteria, and they were included in the final review. A quantitative synthesis from the data of selected articles was impossible because of variable grading systems and variable definitions in their comparisons between patients with and without TURP. However, most published articles demonstrated the increased risk of GU toxicity with TURP in patients treated with RT.

Conclusions

Our systematic review strongly suggests that TURP is one of the risk factors of GU toxicity after RT. This needs to be taken seriously when prostate cancer patients with TURP are considered for RT either external beam or brachytherapy.

### Prediction of clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome by preoperative ultrasonographic estimation of prostate weight [^115sPxrK]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common in elderly men. The risk of BPH increases with age, approaching 50% by the age of 60 years and 90% by the age of 85 years. Numerous therapeutic options are available for BPH, including pharmacological treatment, minimally invasive surgery, and open prostatectomy. Preoperative ultrasonography is often performed to confirm the diagnosis of BPH and to measure the shape, volume, and structure of the prostate.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a standard surgical treatment for BPH. Non-conductive irrigation fluid is used during TURP to maintain good visibility of the operating field during resection of the prostate with monopolar cutting diathermy. The non-conductive irrigation fluid contains no electrolytes, and absorption of this hypotonic solution into the bloodstream can cause fluid overload and dilutional hyponatremia, resulting in adverse cardiovascular and central nervous system effects. Transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome is usually defined as a serum sodium level of < 125 mmol/l combined with clinical cardiovascular or neurological manifestations. However, the clinical manifestations can also occur with a serum sodium level of > 125 mmol/l. Because of the multifactorial pathophysiology of TUR syndrome, few studies have used a clear and consistent definition of this condition. This study used the severity score for TUR syndrome proposed by Hahn, which is based on a checklist of central nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities (Table 1).

Table 1
Severity score checklist

A checklist used to define and score the clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome.

HR, heart rate; SAP, systolic arterial pressure.

The theoretical risk factors for TUR syndrome include patent prostatic sinuses, high irrigation pressure, prolonged operation time, and use of hypotonic irrigation fluid. It was reported that 77% of patients undergoing TURP had significant pre-existing medical conditions, and that resection time > 90 min, estimated prostate weight > 45 g, acute urinary retention, age > 80 years, and African descent were associated with increased morbidity. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for development of the clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome, and to investigate whether these clinical manifestations could be predicted by preoperative estimation of prostate weight by ultrasonography.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^116Y571o]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment — goals, medications, and procedural indications/classification are outlined as follows: Traditionally, the primary goal of treatment has been to alleviate bothersome LUTS that result from BPO, and more recently treatment has also focused on the prevention of disease progression and complications such as AUR; pharmacologic classes used to treat LUTS/BPH include alpha-adrenergic antagonists (alpha blockers), 5-ARIs, PDE5, and anticholinergics, which may be utilized alone or in combination to take advantage of their different mechanisms of action, and an additional class of agent that may be considered in combination with alpha blockers is beta-3 agonists; there exist clinical scenarios in which conservative or pharmacological management are either inadequate or inappropriate and long-term use of medications for LUTS/BPH have been implicated in cognitive issues and depression, and these situations merit consideration of one of the many invasive procedures available for the treatment of LUTS/BPH; indications include a desire by the patient to avoid taking a daily medication, failure of medical therapy to sufficiently ameliorate bothersome LUTS, intolerance to pharmaceutical side effects, and conditions for which medical therapy is insufficient such as acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, recurrent bladder stones, and recalcitrant gross hematuria; acute and chronic adverse events associated with each class of medical therapy can include cardiovascular and sexual effects; surgical treatment of symptomatic BPH may be classified into three general types: 1. MIST; 2. Simple prostatectomy; and 3. Transurethral surgery, with transurethral surgery involving removal of the obstructing adenomatous tissue via the transurethral route, classically with monopolar electrocautery TURP, and alternatives developed including bipolar TURP and various laser-based therapies to achieve similar clinical efficacy while reducing the risks of perioperative bleeding and short- and long-term complications; in appropriate patients for whom the physical size of the prostate cannot be addressed due to the expertise of the surgeon via a safe or efficacious transurethral approach, simple prostatectomy (i.e., adenoma enucleation) may be considered.

### Acute moderate hyponatraemia and its rapid correction: effects on striatal and pontine ultrastructure in an animal model of the TURP syndrome [^114owMyV]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

To investigate the effects of moderate hyponatraemia, induced by intravenous application of an electrolyte-free irrigation fluid, as a model of the human transurethral prostate resection syndrome and of its rapid correction by hypertonic saline infusion in rats.

Methods

Experimental animals received irrigation fluid (Purisole SM) 20 mL kg⁻¹ body weight, intravenously. In one group, hyponatraemia was subsequently rapidly corrected by infusion of hypertonic saline (NaCl 5.85%), while rats of group two were 'sham-corrected' by infusion of a balanced salt crystalloid solution. Plasma sodium concentrations were analysed during and at the end of the experiments. After 10 days, experimental and untreated control animals were killed humanely, fixed by perfusion and the brains were prepared for electron microscopic investigation of myelin sheets and glial cell numbers in the striatum and pons.

Results

The myelin appearance was unaltered in experimental groups compared to controls, but glial cell numbers were distinctly altered in the pons but not in the striatum. In the pons, oligodendrocytes were significantly reduced in number upon rapid correction of hyponatraemia, while astrocyte numbers were increased in rats with uncorrected hyponatraemia.

Conclusions

Our electron microscopic data demonstrate that the effects of hyponatraemia and of its rapid correction are multifarious in animals. This may also apply for human patients during transurethral prostate resection.

### Updates to incontinence after prostate treatment: AUA / GURS / SUFU guideline (2024) [^1145XkSX]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Climacturia after radical prostatectomy (RP) — mechanisms, overlap with SUI, and risk factors — has a pathophysiology that is not completely understood and is thought to relate to removal of the internal sphincter during RP, with bladder contraction at orgasm and external sphincter insufficiency resulting in leakage. Climacturia and SUI overlap, with 30% of patients with climacturia not experiencing SUI and 30% of patients with SUI not reporting climacturia. The main risk factor is time since surgery, with shorter time associated with a higher rate of leakage, and recovery of continence during sexual activity appears faster following robotic RP compared to open or pure laparoscopic RP. Improvement can occur postoperatively but may take several years and typically persists in one-third of patients; other risk factors include prior TURP and shorter functional urethral and penile length, while age, pre-operative erectile function, and nerve sparing status do not appear to significantly affect risk of sexual arousal or orgasm-related incontinence.

### Technological advances in transurethral resection of the prostate: bipolar versus monopolar TURP [^117FFwtZ]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most significant recent advancements in transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the incorporation of bipolar technology. Bipolar circuitry allows TURP to be performed in a normal saline environment, which addresses a fundamental concern of conventional monopolar TURP (i.e., the use of hypo-osmolar irrigation). As a result, the risks of dilutional hyponatremia and transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome are eliminated, allowing for longer and safer resection. This review discusses the principles and applications of electrosurgery in conventional monopolar as well as new bipolar saline-based TURP systems. This review also addresses the positive impact on patient safety and resident training.

### Intravesical pressure and the TUR syndrome [^111xKT7p]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Intravesical pressure was measured continuously during 35 transurethral prostate resections using a fine suprapubic catheter. Absorption of irrigating fluid was detected by tagging it with ethanol and sampling the expired breath using an alcohol meter. Higher mean (SD) intravesical pressure was demonstrated in those patients who absorbed irrigating fluid (19.1 (7.7) mmHg) than in those who did not (12.4 (6.5) mmHg; p = 0.00004). Higher peak pressures were also demonstrated among absorbing patients. Traditional risk factors for fluid absorption, such as operator experience and resectate mass, were found to correlate with pressure exposure over time. Exposure to supranormal bladder pressure over time is the final common path for all causes of absorption. Vesical pressure monitoring may be a valuable feedback tool during difficult resections or operator training.

### Prediction of clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome by preoperative ultrasonographic estimation of prostate weight [^113ouTRD]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of TUR syndrome was higher in our cohort than in previous studies, which reported rates from 0.5% to 10.5%. This can be explained by the varying definitions of TUR syndrome used. Many previous studies defined TUR syndrome as a serum sodium level of ≤ 125 mmol/l after TURP with two additional abnormalities such as nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension, chest pain, mental confusion, anxiety, paresthesia, or visual impairment. The proportion of patients in our study that met this definition based on the sodium level was 13.2%. This study focused on the clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome, regardless of the serum sodium level. The clinical manifestations included central nervous system abnormalities such as nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and coma, and intra- and postoperative cardiovascular abnormalities, according to the checklist proposed by Hahn. Some of our patients with neurological and cardiovascular manifestations of TUR syndrome did not have a serum sodium level of < 125 mmol/l. Patients with a severity score of 1 were treated to avoid further deterioration, regardless of the serum sodium level.

Our results show an optimal cutoff value for estimated prostate weight of 75 g to predict the development of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome, which is heavier than previously suggested weights. Previous studies reported that the most significant risk factors for TUR syndrome were an operation time of > 90 min, a heavier prostate weight such as > 45 g, acute urinary retention, and age > 80 years. These factors increase the risk of TUR syndrome because of the larger quantity of irrigation fluid absorbed. Technical advances and resection speeds of 0.5–0.9 g/min have not resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of TUR syndrome. This study was conducted in our specialized college hospital that is associated with satellite hospitals, and the patients who undergo TURP at our hospital tend to have relatively large prostate glands, resulting in longer operation times and a higher incidence of TUR syndrome. Some centers may perform open prostatectomy in patients with large prostate glands, but TURP is the standard procedure for such cases in Japan.

### Prediction of clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome by preoperative ultrasonographic estimation of prostate weight [^117UjLQM]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 167 patients were included in this study, of which 42 developed clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome (24.2%; 95% confidence interval, 18.5%–31.8%). The majority of initial cardiovascular abnormalities were either hypertension with reflex bradycardia, or sudden hypotension. There were no significant differences in preoperative characteristics between patients with and without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome, except for the preoperative estimated prostate weight (Table 2). There were significant differences in the duration of surgery, resected prostate weight, intravenous infusion volume, blood transfusion volume, and continuous drainage of irrigation fluid via suprapubic cystostomy between patients with and without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome (Table 3). The postoperative serum sodium level and hemoglobin concentration were significantly lower in patients with than without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome. All patients who developed clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome had a severity score of ≥ 2 according to Hahn's checklist at the end of surgery (Table 1). Patients with a score of ≥ 3 required additional intravenous anesthetic agents such as propofol or midazolam. One patient developed severe hyponatremia and required tracheal intubation to manage his cardiovascular and neurological abnormalities. One patient without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome developed postoperative esophageal hemorrhage from ruptured esophageal varices, which was judged to be unrelated to the TURP procedure. One patient without intraoperative manifestations of TUR syndrome developed postoperative nausea and vomiting. All blood transfusions were autologous, except in one of the patients who developed clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome who received an allogeneic transfusion. The preoperative estimated prostate weight was correlated with the resected prostate weight (Spearman's correlation coefficient, 0.749; Figure 2). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff value of estimated prostate weight for the prediction of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome was 75 g (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.69; area under the curve, 0.73; Figure 3).

### TURP inpatient with underactive bladder with BOO |… [^115YSGrW]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

TURP Inpatient With Underactive Bladder With BOOClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Introduction: Aging men frequently develop lower urinary tract symptoms. These symptoms are commonly attributed to bladder outlet obstruction by benign prostatic hyperplasia and the clinical condition is termed BPH. However, recent studies have implicated many factors in the pathogenesis of LUTS in addition to BPH. These include prostate inflammation and fibrosis, increased serum estrogen/testosterone ratio, diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, polyuria and changes in bladder function. Detrusor Under activity is defined by the International Continence Society as "a contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span". Detrusor underactivity was demonstrated in 17% men presenting with LUTS after urodynamic evaluation.

DUA is a common association for persistence of symptoms after TURP in such patients. Projected isovolumetric pressure was proposed by Schäfer, who used a straight line to represent the Bladder Outlet Relation and then "projected" back to the y-axis from the point representing pdet@Qmax to obtain the isovolumetric pressure. This projection is calculated by the formula PIP = Pdet@Qmax + KQmax where K is a fixed constant representing the steepness of the angle of the BOR to x-a axis.
- < 50
- very weak contractility Surgical failure is more likely to occur in patients with detrusor dysfunction and lower baseline Bladder outlet obstruction index. It has also been found that the degree of preoperative BOO is positively associated with improvement and QoL after TURP. Therefore, a preoperative Pressure Flow Study is recommended for optimal selection of patients who are more suitable for surgery by measuring BOOI and assessing detrusor function.

BOOI. Urodynamic Predictors:

- Detrusor contractility.
- Bladder outlet obstruction.
- Functional bladder capacity.
- **UAB severity**: Mild/moderate.

### Transurethral resection syndrome in elderly patients: a retrospective observational study [^115GwUqu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) involves the risk of transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome owing to hyponatremia. Irrigation fluid type, duration of operation, and weight of resected mass have been evaluated as risk factors for TUR syndrome. The purpose of the present study was to identify risk factors related to TUR syndrome in the elderly.

Methods

After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board, data on all elderly males (aged 70 years and older) who underwent TURP under regional anesthesia over a 6-year period at our institution were retrospectively reviewed.

TUR syndrome was defined as evidence of a central nervous system disturbance such as nausea, vomiting, restlessness, confusion, or even coma with a circulatory abnormality both intra- and post-operatively. Patients were divided into two groups, positive and negative, for the occurrence of the syndrome. Data such as previous medical history, preoperative and postoperative serum data, weight of resected mass, duration of operation, irrigation fluid drainage technique, anesthetic technique, operative infusion and transfusion volume, and neurological symptoms were collected. Only observational variables with p < 0.05 on univariate analyses were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to ascertain their independent effects on TUR syndrome.

Results

Of the 98 patients studied, 23 had TUR syndrome (23.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.9–32.0%). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that volume of plasma substitute ≥ 500 mL (odds ratio [OR] 14.7, 95% CI 2.9–74.5), continuous irrigation through a suprapubic cystostomy (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.3–16.7), and weight of resected mass > 45 g (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.2–14.7) were associated with significantly increased risks for TUR syndrome (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p = 0.94, accuracy 84.7%).

Conclusions

These results suggest that the use of a plasma substitute and continuous irrigation through a suprapubic cystostomy must be avoided during TURP procedures in the elderly.

### Transurethral resection syndrome detected and managed using transesophageal Doppler [^1116wLpA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Transurethral resection syndrome during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) results from excessive absorption of electrolyte-free irrigation fluids causing acute hypervolemia and hyponatremia. Neuraxial anesthesia is often recommended for TURP procedures because early signs of neurological deterioration can be detected. However, in patients requiring general anesthesia, other continuous and noninvasive measures are needed. Acute intravascular hypervolemia should be reflected by changes in hemodynamic values. Transesophageal Doppler ultrasonography of the aorta allows determination of stroke volume and other advanced hemodynamic variables related to intravascular volume status. We describe the first case of intraoperative detection of a TURP syndrome by noninvasive Doppler monitoring of hemodynamic variables during TURP.

### A randomized comparison between three types of irrigating fluids during transurethral resection in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113YPVKm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Glucose 5% is relatively more physiological than glycine because it can be given intravenously and with lower incidence of complication. A solution of glucose 5% is metabolized throughout the body, it requires 13 L to be given/absorbed intravenously to expand the intravascular compartment by 1 L.

Normal serum osmolality is ≈ 290 mOsm/L. The osmolality of normal saline 0.9% is about 300 mOsm/L, and that of glucose 5% is 285 mOsm/L, as opposed to the osmolality of glycine 1.5%, which is 190 mOsm/L. This higher osmolality provided by both normal saline 0.9% and glucose 5% solution may be beneficial in reducing the possible side effects of cerebral edema.

Issa et al. in a case study concluded that bipolar saline is a safe and eliminates the risk of TUR syndrome in high-risk patients with large prostates. Michielsen et al. concluded in his study that a bipolar transurethral resection in saline system is as efficacious as monopolar transurethral prostate resection but it is safer than the latter because of the lesser changes in post-operative sodium, and the smaller risk of transurethral resection syndrome.

Two studies done by Collins et al, the first study concluded that an increase in serum glycine was associated with TUR syndrome; there were large variations in the amounts of glycine absorbed, reaching levels many times the upper limit of normal, and although there was immediate postoperative hyperglycemia in patients used glucose 5% as irrigation fluid during TURP, it was not associated with either ECG changes nor elevated serum troponin I. In the second study, glycine was reportedly toxic, producing ECG changes and increase in the serum troponin I. Unrecognized blood loss or glycine absorption may explain the increase in morbidity and mortality reported in patients who undergo TURP.

### Transurethral resection of the prostate [^112LvXbY]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Transuretheral resection of prostate (TURP) is a common operation in most hospitals. The patients are elderly and usually have concomitant diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac and respiratory ailments that increase their perioperative risk. Perioperative morbidity and mortality approaches 20% and 1% respectively. Regional anesthesia, notably spinal anesthesia, offers many advantages over general anesthesia for TURP with some evidence of lower morbidity even though similar mortality rates and overall outcomes are reported for both groups. Procedure-specific complications include TURP syndrome, bladder perforation, primary fibrinolysis, bacteremia, and septicemia. All are associated with significant morbidity and mortality but amenable to early and aggressive therapeutic intervention.

### Sudden occurence of hypotension and bradycardia during greenlight laser transurethral resection of prostate: case report of two cases [^116R46Aa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Greenlight laser transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) is a standard surgical method used to treat patients with prostate gland enlargement, it is safe and effective.

Case presentation

We report two cases of sudden occurence of hypotension and bradycardia during greenlight laser TURP. Two patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy were scheduled for greenlight laser TURP under spinal anesthesia. Hypotension and bradycardia were suddenly occurred during the operation. The blood gas analysis revealed no hyponatremia (indicating TURP syndrome) or anemia (indicating hemorrhage). Operation was suspended and inotropic agents were administrated intravenous immediately, then blood pressure and heart rate increased to normal level within some minutes. The patients were discharged from hospital without any complications. We considered parasympathetic reflex was occurred during greenlight laser TURP.

Conclusion

Apart from TURP syndrome, hemorrhage, bladder perforation and high spinal anesthesia, the parasympathetic reflex which is caused by operative process can also induce hypotension and bradycardia during TURP.

TURBT resection may be complicated with bladder perforation associated with intraperitoneal extravasation of irrigant fluid, which may rarely evolve in specific hydroelectrolyte imbalance characterized with hyponatremia, intravascular volume deficit, and renal impairment. We report four cases of TURBT syndrome during bladder surgery complicated by bladder perforation and discuss issues relevant to pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare condition.

### Bipolar transurethral resection versus monopolar transurethral resection for benign prostatic hypertrophy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158vPae]. Journal of Endourology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of monopolar (M-TURP) and bipolar (B-TURP) transurethral resection of the prostate in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) patients.

Materials and Methods

Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from electronic databases without language restrictions. Database search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed. The primary postoperative outcomes of topical M-TURP and B-TURP were maximum flow rate (Qmax) and/or International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Safety was estimated by TUR syndrome; need for transfusion; clot retention; bladder neck contracture (BNC); urethral stricture (US); and catheter removal time. Efficacy and safety were investigated using the Review Manager.

Results

Thirty-one trials met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis revealed significant difference in efficacy between the M-TURP and B-TURP groups. Safety analysis revealed significant improvement in the TUR syndrome with B-TURP than with M-TURP. Pooled analysis revealed that clot retention was significantly higher in M-TURP than in B-TURP. Moreover, pooled analysis revealed no significant difference between both groups in the blood transfusion frequency or late complications (urethral strictures) and bladder neck constriction.

Conclusions

This systematic review indicates that B-TURP was significantly better in the result of Qmax and for decreasing the incidence of TUR syndrome and clot retention. No significant differences were observed in the nature of adverse events such as transfusions, retention after catheter removal, and urethral complications between both groups. Thus, B-TURP is the next generation "gold standard" for benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) because it is associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant complications such as TUR syndrome and clot retention.

### Could transurethral resection of the prostate using the TURis system take over conventional monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate? A randomized controlled trial and midterm results [^112C9ubn]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate using the TURis (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) system demonstrates comparable efficacy and safety reporting 36 months of follow-up findings.

Methods

The trial was registered at University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry in Japan (trial number UMIN 000010801). Patients were randomly selected to undergo transurethral resection of the prostate using either the TURis or the conventional monopolar technique. Primary end points were safety according to operation time, decline of sodium and hemoglobin levels, clot retention, and catheterization time. Secondary end points were efficacy findings for patients after 36 months of follow-up.

Results

A total of 136 patients were enrolled. Mean operation times were significantly prolonged in the TURis group (68.4 and 79.5 minutes for monopolar and TURis groups, respectively; p = 0.048). No significant differences in the decline of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and perioperative transfusion rates between groups were seen, whereas clot retention (grade 2) after the treatment seemed to occur more often in the monopolar group (7 of 62 [12.3%] in monopolar group vs 1 of 63 [1/8%] in TURis group; p = 0.061). No case presented symptomatic transurethral resection syndrome in either groups.

Conclusion

Continued efficacy at 36 months after the treatment could be confirmed for the first time in TURis system, which also seems to be preferable as they produced more clinically favorable outcomes. Nevertheless, the TURis system required significantly more resection time, which might not entirely be a panacea for the treatment of benign prostatic obstruction, especially for patients having larger prostatic volumes.

### Recognition and management of Tourette's syndrome and tic… [^115w5Vt1]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

In most cases, tics peak in severity between nine and 11 years of age. In one study, 10 73 percent of patients reported that their tics had disappeared or considerably decreased at follow-up. In another follow-up study, 11 only 9 percent of study subjects had severe symptoms after five to 15 years. In our experience, about 85 percent of patients have remission or improve considerably as adults. Pathophysiology The precise etiology of Tourette's syndrome is unknown. Tics are believed to result from a tripartite dysfunction in the central nervous system. Imaging techniques have implicated the basal ganglia and frontal cortex in the pathogenesis of Tourette's syndrome. 12–14 The second source of abnormality is thought to be inappropriate regulation of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine.

15 Strong evidence indicates that dopamine excess or supersensitivity of the postsynaptic dopamine receptors is the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of Tourette's syndrome. 16–19 The third hypothesis of dysfunction is a neurophysiologic deficit secondary to neurotransmitter abnormalities, resulting in failure of inhibition of the frontal-subcortical motor circuits. 23, 24 In our experience, comorbid conditions have a multiple effect on overall severity. As a result, it will often be necessary to develop intervention plans for these comorbid conditions, even if the severity of each individually is low. The phenotypic variation that is also seen in monozygotic twins may be associated with differences in dopamine D 2-receptor binding in the caudate nucleus.
25. Walkup and associates 26 reject the autosomal dominant theory and propose a mixed model of inheritance that includes an additive major locus combined with a multifactorial background.

Male offspring are more prone to express tic syndromes, and female offspring are more prone to have obsessive-compulsive disorder without tics. This observation supports the theory that obsessive-compulsive disorder and chronic tic disorder are alternate phenotypes of a putative Tourette's syndrome gene. The correlation of microbiologic and serologic evidence of streptococcal infection with a single occurrence of tic exacerbation is insufficient to make a diagnosis of streptococcus-induced, autoimmune-caused Tourette's syndrome. Such findings are likely to be nonspecific, especially in a pediatric population. A pattern of correlation that varies over time with the presence or absence of symptoms would be more convincing.

### Transurethral resection syndrome in elderly patients: a retrospective observational study [^113F6k3t]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Generally, regional anesthesia should be performed during operations in which TUR syndrome might occur, because spinal anesthesia allows early detection of changes in mental status. However, the effectiveness of this approach is still controversial. Symptoms of TUR syndrome may not be directly related to hyponatremia. Nevertheless, frequent blood sampling is required to accurately monitor serum sodium levels. Adding ethyl alcohol to the irrigation fluid may allow early detection of the absorption of irrigation fluid by permitting analysis of the alcohol content in the exsufflated air.

Hypotension during TURP can be caused by three factors: adopting a combination of epidural and spinal anesthesia; hyponatremia; and vagovagal reflex caused by filling of the bladder. It is difficult to distinguish between these phenomena. We carefully used the epidural anesthesia to avoid a sudden reduction in blood pressure. Continuous epidural anesthesia was used mostly with 5 ml/h of 0.2% ropivacaine. Vagovagal reflex may be judged as a cardiovascular abnormality.

Recently, the advent of bipolar electrodes for coagulation has allowed the use of electrolytic irrigation fluid. Although this can decrease the risk of TUR syndrome, researchers have reported longer operative times owing to smaller and finer resection loops and a higher rate of postoperative urethral stricture. Likewise, Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) may become an alternative to standard TURP in the future. However, despite the reported decreases in bleeding, TUR syndrome remains a possibility with HoLEP.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112sZjn1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Transurethral resection of the prostate syndrome: almost gone but not forgotten [^113bW6mm]. Journal of Endourology (2009). Low credibility.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal syndrome with multifactorial pathophysiology that is now better understood. Unfortunately, despite this improved understanding, it is not yet obsolete and still remains a risk. Many reviews of TURP syndrome have been presented from an anesthetic perspective; this review reflects more the urologic perspective with emphasis on the importance of multidisciplinary management of this complex syndrome. We present a review of TURP syndrome that specifically assesses advances in the understanding of risk factors, pathophysiology, and techniques used to prevent this syndrome. The databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were systematically reviewed from inception to April 2009 for the keywords TUR (P), TUR (P) syndrome, and transurethral resection of prostate. There was no language restriction for our search. Randomized controlled trials, review articles and case series were included in our search. Our review showed a declining trend in the incidence of TURP syndrome despite TURP remaining the gold standard for the management of benign prostatic obstruction. Technologic advances using an array of laser techniques, the use of bipolar circuitry, together with advances in training techniques have helped minimize the risk of development of this syndrome. This review demonstrates the complexity of TURP syndrome. Even with a greater understanding of the pathophysiology, it highlights the unpredictability of the syndrome from presenting symptoms, preventative measures, and management. TURP syndrome cannot be protocol driven and the need for vigilance, a high index of suspicion, intensive monitoring, and a multidisciplinary approach is vital.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^114NwZaW]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.

### Dilutional hyponatremia of TURP syndrome: a historical event in the 21st century [^1153MhYc]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the risk of hyponatremia and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) syndrome after bipolar saline TURP in patients with large-volume, benign prostatic hyperplasia and statistically significant comorbidities.

Methods

Five patients with large symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and significant comorbidities underwent saline TURP. Data were collected regarding patient profile, prostate weight, operative time, and perioperative events. In particular, we studied and compared the preoperative and postoperative serum sodium concentrations and hematocrit.

Results

The mean age was 68 years (range 57 to 76). The mean resection weight of the prostatic chips was 49.6 g (range 37 to 62). Senior urology residents under the supervision of the university faculty performed all procedures. The average operative time was 2 hours, 22 minutes (range 98 to 175 minutes). The mean serum sodium concentration decreased by 1.6 mg/dL (from 138.4 mg/dL preoperatively to 136.8 mg/dL postoperatively). The mean hematocrit decreased by 5.60% (from 40.24% preoperatively to 34.64% postoperatively). Postoperative recovery was uneventful in all 5 patients.

Conclusions

Bipolar saline TURP is safe and eliminates the risk of TURP syndrome in high-risk patients with large prostates that require lengthy resection. In addition, the system permits the faculty to spend the time needed for teaching and training urology residents without compromising patient safety.

Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) — comparative outcomes versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in men with small prostates are as follows: TUIP has been used to treat small prostates, usually defined as ≤ 30g. A meta-analysis found lower retrograde ejaculation with TUIP (18.2% versus 65.4%) and lower need for blood transfusion (0.4% versus 8.6%) after a minimum 6‑month follow-up. For the guideline period, 1 RCT (n = 86; 80 completers) with 4‑year follow-up in men with small prostates (≤ 30g) reported mean age 65 years, baseline IPSS 19 and prostate size 28g; long‑term change in IPSS was similar (WMD: 0.5; 95%CI: -0.2, 1.2). Erectile dysfunction occurred in 8% with TUIP versus 20% with TURP and was not significant (RR: 0.4; 95%CI: 0.1, 1.3), whereas retrograde ejaculation occurred in 30 participants overall (9 TUIP, 21 TURP).

### The effect of irrigation solution volume on electrolytes and… [^112xbbMe]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

The Effect of Irrigation Solution Volume on Electrolytes and Acid-Base BalanceClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Background: There are several surgical procedures in which irrigation fluids are used to enable vision and treatment in body cavities, such as hysteroscopy, arthroscopy and cystoscopy. Several solutions are used for irrigation: normal saline, glycin, mannitol, sorbitol and others. Post-operative complications, as visual disturbances, confusion and other neurologic symptoms were attributed to irrigation fluid absorption, water intoxication and hyponatremia, and are refered to as "TURP syndrome" when appearing following transurethral prostatectomy. Historically, a reduced serum sodium concentration has been used to diagnose absorption of electrolytes-free irrigating fluid during urologic procedures.

However, neurologic symptoms following transurethral prostatectomy do not correlate with blood sodium level, moreover, Hyponatremia may not be the sole or even the primary cause of the neurological manifestations of TURP syndrome. Other techniques were suggested for evaluating the volume of irrigation solution absorption though none is used routinely in the clinical setting. Percutaneous Lithotripsy is a procedure used to treat patients with nephrolithiasis. In this procedure irrigation fluid is administered into the kidney and urinary tract collecting system. The solution used is normal saline. In earlier studies there was no evidence for absorption of the irrigation fluids, though medical literature on this issue is limited. However, minute changes in electrolytes and acid-base balance may indicate the opposite is true. Indeed, the volume of irrigation and duration of the procedure may have an effect as well.

According to the investigators hypothesis, the change in Ph and reduction in base content in patients undergoing PCNL may be the result of irrigation fluid absorption, since chloride from the normal saline is known to cause such effect. Methods This is an observational prospective study of consecutive 200 adult patients undergoing elective surgery of PCNL in the investigators operating rooms. The investigators will collect data that is taken from the patient's file and routine management of these patients: age, gender, weight, pre-operative blood tests including: electrolytes, creatinine, hematocrit, ph, bicarbonate, base, length of the procedure, volume and type of irrigation fluids used, volume and type of intravenous fluids used. Post-operative blood tests will be recorded.

### Change in serum sodium level predicts clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome: a retrospective review [^111iyqC8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Records of patients who underwent TURP under local anesthesia at our hospital from 2006 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Osaka Medical College (reference number 898), which waived the requirement for informed consent due to the retrospective design of the study.

Preoperative spinal anesthesia was achieved via administration of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride (2.0–3.0 ml) at L3/4 or L4/5, resulting in analgesia up to thoracic level 10 (T10). If spinal anesthesia was ineffective, the patient was removed from the study. If the anesthetized region was lower than the T10 sensory levels or operation time was longer than 1.5 h, 0.375% ropivacaine hydrochloride (3.0–5.0 ml) was administrated as epidural anesthesia through a catheter at L1/2 or L2/3, followed by continuous administration of 0.2% ropivacaine hydrochloride (2–5 ml/h) through the postoperative period. Patients with preoperative urethral bleeding disorders, renal insufficiency, or contraindications to spinal anesthesia were excluded.

### Acute abdominal compartment syndrome as a complication of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: a case report [^117J7SJL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Transurethral prostatic resections are very common procedures, and the most frequent complication, which is of concern for the anaesthesiologist, is TUR syndrome due to hypotonic hyperhydration. One advantage of the HoLEP technique is that an isotonic irrigant solution is used and TUR syndrome is impossible. During the procedure, the irrigant solution is allowed to flow continuously without intermittent vesicular pressure relief. Typically, the irrigation bag is only lifted 50–80 cm above the patient's level. The mean surgical time is longer compared to TURP and the number of catheterisations, the length of hospital stay and the risk of adverse events are lower. Typical complications include bleeding, capsular perforation, superficial bladder mucosal injury and bladder perforation, which can occur during different phases of the procedure. The coagulative properties of the holmium laser seal the vessels and prevent absorption of the irrigant.

### Bipolar versus monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117SxFbV]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Incorporation of bipolar technology in transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate (TURP) potentially offers advantages over monopolar TURP (M-TURP).

Objective

To evaluate the evidence by a meta-analysis, based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bipolar TURP (B-TURP) with M-TURP for benign prostatic obstruction. Primary end points included efficacy (maximum flow rate [Q(max)], International Prostate Symptom Score) and safety (adverse events). Secondary end points included operation time and duration of irrigation, catheterization, and hospitalization.

Evidence Acquisition

Based on a detailed, unrestricted strategy, the literature was searched up to February 19, 2009, using Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library to detect all relevant RCTs. Methodological quality assessment of the trials was based on the Dutch Cochrane Collaboration checklist. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.0.

Evidence Synthesis

Sixteen RCTs (1406 patients) were included. Overall trial quality was low (eg, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors were poorly reported). No clinically relevant differences in short-term (12-mo) efficacy were detected (Q(max): weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.72 ml/s; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08–1.35; p = 0.03). Data on follow-up of > 12 mo are scarce for B-TURP, precluding long-term efficacy evaluation. Treating 50 patients (95% CI, 33–111) and 20 patients (95% CI, 10–100) with B-TURP results in one fewer case of TUR syndrome (risk difference [RD]: 2.0%; 95% CI, 0.9–3.0%; p = 0.01) and one fewer case of clot retention (RD: 5.0%; 95% CI, 1.0–10%; p = 0.03), respectively. Operation times, transfusion rates, retention rates after catheter removal, and urethral complications did not differ significantly. Irrigation and catheterization duration was significantly longer with M-TURP (WMD: 8.75 h; 95% CI, 6.8–10.7 and WMD: 21.77 h; 95% CI, 19.22–24.32; p < 0.00001, respectively). Inferences for hospitalization duration could not be made. PlasmaKinetic TURP showed an improved safety profile. Data on TUR in saline (TURis) are not yet mature to permit safe conclusions.

Conclusions

No clinically relevant differences in short-term efficacy exist between the two techniques, but B-TURP is preferable due to a more favorable safety profile (lower TUR syndrome and clot retention rates) and shorter irrigation and catheterization duration. Well-designed multicentric/international RCTs with long-term follow-up and cost analysis are still needed.

### Does an electronic cognitive aid have an effect on the management of severe gynaecological TURP syndrome? A prospective, randomised simulation study [^116ygAha]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lack of familiarity with the content of current guidelines is a major factor associated with non-compliance by clinicians. It is conceivable that cognitive aids with regularly updated medical content can guide clinicians' task performance by evidence-based practices, even if they are unfamiliar with the actual guideline. Acute hyponatraemia as a consequence of TURP syndrome is a rare intraoperative event, and current practice guidelines have changed from slow correction to rapid correction of serum sodium levels. The primary objective of this study was to compare the management of a simulated severe gynaecological transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) syndrome under spinal anaesthesia with either: an electronic cognitive aid, or with management from memory alone. The secondary objective was to assess the clinical relevance and participant perception of the usefulness of the cognitive aid.

Methods

Anaesthetic teams were allocated to control (no cognitive aid; n = 10) or intervention (cognitive aid provided; n = 10) groups. We identified eight evidence-based management tasks for severe TURP syndrome from current guidelines and subdivided them into acute heart failure (AHF)/pulmonary oedema tasks (5) and acute hyponatraemia tasks (3). Implementation of the treatment steps was measured by scoring task items in a binary fashion (yes/no). To assess whether or not the cognitive aid had prompted a treatment step, participants from the cognitive aid group were questioned during debriefing on every single treatment step. At the end of the simulation, session participants were asked to complete a survey.

Results

Teams in the cognitive aid group considered evidence-based treatment steps significantly more often than teams of the control group (96% vs. 50% for 'AHF/pulmonary oedema' p < 0.001; 79% vs. 12% for 'acute hyponatraemia' p < 0.001). Without the cognitive aid, performance would have been comparable across both groups. Nurses, trainees, and consultants derived equal benefit from the cognitive aid.

Conclusions

The cognitive aid improved the implementation of evidence-based practices in a simulated intraoperative scenario. Cognitive aids with current medical content could help to close the translational gap between guideline publication and implementation in acute patient care. It is important that the cognitive aid should be familiar, in a format that has been used in practice and training.

### Acute abdominal compartment syndrome as a complication of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: a case report [^114rmDcd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been developed over the years and can be performed using different techniques. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) allows resection of large prostatic hyperplasias. During the procedure, the laser fibre dissects the prostatic lobes off the surgical capsule similar to how a surgeon's finger would during an open, transvesicular prostatectomy. First, the enucleated lobes are pushed back into the bladder. At the end of the procedure, the large prostatic tissue chunks are reduced to small pieces using a soft tissue morcellator to allow evacuation from the bladder. The HoLEP technique was introduced in 1996 and has been shown to be safe and highly effective. One rare complication is capsular perforation, but no case of intra-abdominal compartment syndrome has been reported thus far. Here, we present a case of massive irrigant fluid leakage into the retroperitoneal space leading to intestinal paralysis and intra-abdominal hypertension.

### A randomized comparison between three types of irrigating fluids during transurethral resection in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112Q4NWU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Many endoscopic surgical procedures require the use of an irrigating fluid to dilate the operating field and to wash away debris and blood. A potential complication of such irrigation is a systemic absorption of the fluid to the extent that overt symptoms are produced. The ideal irrigant for endoscopic resection would be a user-friendly, non-conductor medium that does not interfere with diathermia, has a high degree of translucency, has similar osmolarity to the serum and causes only minimal side effects when absorbed. There are several different irrigating fluids available commercially and it may be difficult to know which one to use. The choice tends to be governed largely by tradition, although the price and properties of the fluid (e.g. stickiness and transparency) also play a role. The pharmacological effects of the fluid become important whenever it is absorbed by the patient. Glycine is an endogenous amino acid without an allergic reaction potential. It is transparent and reasonably inexpensive. However, the solution is unphysiological because it lacks electrolyte and excessive absorption is a recognized complication. Nausea, vomiting, confusion and arterial hypotension occur significantly more often when between 1.000 and 2.000 mL of glycine solution are absorbed. Severe forms of TUR syndrome are more rare but they require treatment in the intensive care unite (ICU) at least over night. The incidence and severity of symptoms of TUR syndrome increase progressively as more glycine solution is absorbed during TURP and the severity of symptoms is markedly aggravated when more than 3,000 mL are absorbed. Deaths have been reported in patients undergoing TURP. Laboratory studies in animals showed that glycine has direct and indirect cardiotoxic effects.

Unlike glycine, glucose is a physiological solution that is readily metabolized when absorbed in most patients. The aim of this study is to compare perioperative morbidity, operation time, and length of hospital stay for glycine 1.5% versus glucose 5% and saline 0.9% as irrigating solutions during TURP in patients with moderate to severe bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

### Transurethral resection syndrome in elderly patients: a retrospective observational study [^113Lm8Au]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, TUR syndrome was defined as the presence of one or more cardiovascular symptoms and one or more neurological symptoms. In previous reports, the occurrence of TUR syndrome varied, with a range of 0.5 to 10.5%, because few studies used a clear definition. Many previous studies defined TUR as sodium concentrations of 125 mmol/l or less after TURP with two of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting bradycardia, hypotension, chest pain, mental confusion, anxiety, paresthesiae, and visual disturbance. According to our clinical data and experience, not all patients with dynamic cardiovascular and neurological symptoms have serum sodium levels of 125 mmol/l or less. When a patient has only one symptom, the serum sodium level can be more than 135 mmol/l. In the present study, the rate of incidence of TUR syndrome was higher than in past reports. There are two possible reasons for this. One is the advanced age of the patients in the present study, because circulatory abnormalities are a greater risk in elderly patients. Another possible reason is that serum sodium levels were not included in the present definition of TUR syndrome. As mentioned, the serum sodium level is even more than 135 mmol/l at the beginning of TUR syndrome. If the patient's status deteriorated, treatment was performed to avoid the occurrence of more severe symptoms. With respect to other conditions, D-sorbitol 3% was used as the nonconductive irrigation fluid. Bags were placed 90 cm above the operating table. Hahn et al. reported no significant differences in the volume of irrigation fluid absorbed at different bag heights. The safe height for the irrigation fluid during TURP remains controversial, but it may affect the quantity of fluid absorbed.

### Metabolic acidemia due to saline absorption during transurethral and transcervical surgery: a report of 2 cases [^111u3Arh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In conventional TUR or TCR surgery with monopolar electrocautery, TUR syndrome caused by nonelectrolyte IFA has been a major concern for surgeons and anesthesiologists. In recent years, endoscopic systems that allow bipolar electrocautery have been developed, which therefore allow irrigation with normal saline. This new endoscopic system has eliminated the occurrence of TUR syndrome caused by nonelectrolyte IFA. However, there have been reports of other intraoperative complications caused by saline irrigation, namely, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

Intravascular or intraperitoneal absorption of a large volume of normal saline can lead to acidemia due to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and disruption of the acid–base balance can cause a crisis in anesthetic management. Acute metabolic acidosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates as a result of significant hemodynamic deterioration, cardiac arrhythmias, increased inflammation, and an impaired immune response. In addition to electrolyte and acid‒base imbalances, anesthesiologists should be aware of the potential development of head and neck edema and pulmonary edema as a result of volume overload. Like in the present case, saline IFA during HoLEP (holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) has been reported to cause notable head and neck edema, which requires subsequent tracheal intubation. Additionally, pulmonary edema during TCR has been reported.

There are 2 principal routes of absorption into the body: the vascular bed into blood vessels and through extravasation into the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space via the site of organ perforation. According to the British Society for Gynecological Endoscopy and European Society for Gynecological Endoscopy guidelines, the deficit of irrigated fluid should be closely monitored and the maximum limit of saline absorption in healthy patients should be set at 2500 mL. For elderly patients with cardiovascular, renal, or other comorbidities, the maximum saline absorption volume should be decreased and set to 1500 mL. In the present study, 5 L of saline leaked into the peritoneum mainly via a perforation in the bladder (patient 1), whereas 4 L of saline was absorbed via the vascular bed of the uterus (patient 2), leading to significant acidemia. Risk factors for IFA syndrome include a prolonged surgery duration, large irrigation volume, height of the irrigation solution bag exceeding 60 cm, and high intravesical or intrauterine pressure.

### Prediction of clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome by preoperative ultrasonographic estimation of prostate weight [^112kbJyA]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between preoperative estimated prostate weight on ultrasonography and clinical manifestations of transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome.

Methods

The records of patients who underwent TUR of the prostate under regional anesthesia over a 6-year period were retrospectively reviewed. TUR syndrome is usually defined as a serum sodium level of < 125 mmol/l combined with clinical cardiovascular or neurological manifestations. This study focused on the clinical manifestations only, and recorded specific central nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities according to the checklist proposed by Hahn. Patients with and without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome were compared to determine the factors associated with TUR syndrome. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff value of estimated prostate weight for the prediction of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome.

Results

This study included 167 patients, of which 42 developed clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome. There were significant differences in preoperative estimated prostate weight, operation time, resected prostate weight, intravenous fluid infusion volume, blood transfusion volume, and drainage of the suprapubic irrigation fluid between patients with and without clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome. The preoperative estimated prostate weight was correlated with the resected prostate weight (Spearman's correlation coefficient, 0.749). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff value of estimated prostate weight for the prediction of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome was 75 g (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.69; area under the curve, 0.73).

Conclusions

Preoperative estimation of prostate weight by ultrasonography can predict the development of clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome. Particular care should be taken when the estimated prostate weight is > 75 g.

### Change in serum sodium level predicts clinical manifestations of transurethral resection syndrome: a retrospective review [^117B99h7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 229 patients included in this study, 60 (26.2%) developed clinical manifestations of TUR syndrome and 169 (73.8%) did not. Most cardiovascular abnormalities were hypertension with reflex bradycardia, or sudden hypotension, which is in agreement with our previous findings. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, except for preoperatively estimated prostatic grand size (Table 2). However, the two groups showed significant differences in the duration of surgery, weight of resected specimen, volumes of intravenous infused liquid and transfused blood volume, continuous drainage of irrigation fluid via suprapubic cystostomy, minimum serum sodium concentrations, and postoperative blood sampling (Table 3). Minimum serum sodium level means the smallest amount of sodium detected in each patient in the intraoperative and postoperative period. Eight patients required sedatives, diuretic drugs, and/or sodium to alleviate these symptoms and correct their hyponatremia. Patients with severe symptoms such as confusion required additional intravenous anesthetic agents with appropriate airway management. In addition, of the 195 patients who maintained a normal sodium level in the intra- and post-operative period, 31 patients showed symptoms. Of the 34 patients with sodium level less than or equal 125 mmol/l, five patients did not show any symptoms.

### Another feature of TURP syndrome: hyperglycaemia and lactic acidosis caused by massive absorption of sorbitol [^115xcZmZ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Endoscopic transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be complicated by absorption of a large volume of irrigation fluid. The clinical features of this complication are referred as the TURP syndrome. We report a case where hyperglycaemia and lactic acidosis complicated the TURP syndrome caused by the massive absorption (approximately 15 litres) of a sorbitol- mannitol irrigation solution. The proposed mechanism is a type B lactic acidosis related to the metabolism of sorbitol.

### Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate versus transurethral resection of the prostate for men with lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention (UNBLOCS): a randomised controlled trial [^113iPhw6]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic obstruction is a common condition resulting from prostate enlargement, and can cause lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention, with a substantial effect on men's quality of life. Surgery to relieve the obstruction is indicated after failure of medication to improve voiding and to prevent the complications associated with benign prostatic obstruction. Bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction affect around 3% of men aged 45–49 years in the UK, increasing to more than 30% of men aged 85 years and older. With an ageing population in the UK, the number of patients with benign prostatic obstruction is expected to grow, increasing the need for surgery.

Around 25 000 prostate operations are done annually in the UK to relieve benign prostatic obstruction. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the gold standard of surgery for over 40 years, accounting for around 80% of operations. TURP is generally a successful procedure but is associated with small but significant mortality (0.3% within 30 days) and morbidity risks including transurethral resection syndrome (absorption of irrigating fluid causing confusion and collapse), haemorrhage during the operation, and subsequent urinary tract infections.

### A randomized comparison between three types of irrigating fluids during transurethral resection in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117MCMSj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized single blinded trail was performed in patients with prostatic hyperplasia admitted for endoscopic resection of the prostate using three different types of irrigating fluids during resection, demonstrated high incidence of TUR syndrome in patients used glycine 1.5% solution, while non in neither glucose nor saline groups developed TUR syndrome. Elevated glycine levels was observed in patients in glycine group of whom the highest values suffered TUR syndrome and was associated with ischemic ECG changes and elevated troponin I in these patients.

The use of an irrigating fluid during many endoscopic surgical procedures is mandatory to dilate the operating field and to wash away debris and blood. The systemic absorption of such an irrigating fluid may be associated with serious complications. Large-scale fluid absorption is rare but leads to symptoms severe enough to require intensive care. Patho-physiological mechanisms consist of pharmacological effects of irrigant solutes, the volume effect of irrigant water, dilutional hyponatraemia and brain edema.

Glycine solution is the most commonly used irrigant in TURP. Many studies performed on human denoting that glycine absorption causes echocardiogram changes and it is associated with increased troponin I. Another experimental studies showed that glycine has a cardio-toxic properties and fluid absorption during TURP has devitalizing effect on the heart. High glycine levels are suspected of causing cerebral edema, visual disturbances and even transient blindness.

Hyper-ammonaemic encephalopathy may develop as ammonia is an intermediate product in glycine metabolism. Another disorder of glycine metabolism characterized by episodes of ketosis and metabolic acidosis that may proceed to coma had been reported. Potentially safer alternatives to glycine irrigation are normal saline 0.9% and glucose 5% to be used as irrigating fluid during TURP. Normal saline is the ideal irrigation fluid for TURP; however its electrical conducting properties prohibit its use with conventional monpolar TURP system in the past. The advance of using bipolar resectoscope that allows resection using normal saline allows us to use it safely with no risks of precipitating hyponatreamia which is the main pathology in TUR syndrome. However, it is rapid infusion of normal saline 0.09% that can cause hypercholeramic metabolic acidosis.

### Fluid absorption in endoscopic surgery [^1123XjQt]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Fluid absorption is an unpredictable complication of endoscopic surgery. Absorption of small amounts of fluid (1–2 litre) occurs in 5–10% of patients undergoing transurethral prostatic resection and results in an easily overlooked mild transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome. Large-scale fluid absorption is rare but leads to symptoms severe enough to require intensive care. Pathophysiological mechanisms consist of pharmacological effects of the irrigant solutes, the volume effect of the irrigant water, dilutional hyponatraemia and brain oedema. Other less widely known factors include absolute losses of sodium by urinary excretion and morphological changes in the heart muscle, both of which promote a hypokinetic circulation. Studies in animals, volunteers and patients show that irrigation with glycine solution should be avoided. Preventive measures, such as low-pressure irrigation, might reduce the extent of fluid absorption but does not eliminate this complication. Monitoring the extent of absorption during surgery allows control of the fluid balance in the individual patient, but such monitoring is not used widely. However, the anaesthetist must be aware of the symptoms and be able to diagnose this complication. Treatment should be based on administration of hypertonic saline rather than on diuretics. New techniques, such as bipolar resectoscopes and vaporizing instead of resecting tissue, result in a continuous change of the prerequisites for fluid absorption and its consequences.

### Does an electronic cognitive aid have an effect on the management of severe gynaecological TURP syndrome? A prospective, randomised simulation study [^115j2MGg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

As participants were familiarised with the CAs immediately prior to the simulation it is conceivable that we introduced confirmation bias in favour of the use and importance of CAs in practice. This bias may have increased the utilization in the scenario as compared to real perioperative emergencies and may have affected responses in the survey.

Another limitation of the study is the fact that both the CA used in the study, as well as the scoring system for the primary outcome were generated from the same material. Although action items were selected in an iterative process by the authors, it is possible that the scoring system might be scoring adherence to itself, thereby creating an inherent bias.

The comparison of tasks performed from memory alone is based on information participants from the CA group gave during debriefing. This approach inevitably carries the risk that the respondents from the CA group might have made biased statements. As an alternative, we could have tested participants' knowledge concerning the current treatment recommendations of acute hyponatraemia with a written questionnaire prior to the simulation course. However, we decided against this approach because we did not want to give participants a clue about which emergency scenario to expect.

Although a team of experienced simulation instructors developed the post-simulation survey, it did not undergo validation testing. In addition, the small sample size precluded statistical analysis for the majority of questions. Nonetheless, we believe that the questions were context-relevant and were suited to elicit the perception of participants on the usefulness and clinical relevance of the CA.

### Metabolic syndrome and smoking are associated with persistence of nocturia after transurethral resection of the prostate [^116UpRzT]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between smoking, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and persistence of nocturia in patients with moderate/severe nocturia (nocturia episodes ≥ 2), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

Methods

From 2015 onward, a consecutive series of patients with moderate/severe nocturia (nocturia episodes ≥ 2), LUTS, and BPE undergoing TURP were prospectively enrolled. Medical history, physical examination, and smoking status were recorded. MetS was defined according to Adult Treatment Panel III. Moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP was defined as nocturia episodes ≥ 2. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk of persisting nocturia.

Results

One hundred two patients were enrolled with a median age of 70 years (interquartile range: 65/73). After TURP, moderate/severe nocturia was reported in 43 of 102 (42%) of the patients. Overall 40 of 102 (39%) patients presented a MetS, and out of them, 23 of 40 (58%) presented a moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP (P = 0.001). Overall 62 of 102 (61%) patients were smokers, and out of them, 32 of 62 (52%) presented moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP (P = 0.034). On multivariate analysis, prostate volume, MetS, and smoking were independent risk factors for moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP.

Conclusion

In our single-center study, MetS and smoking increased the risk of moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP in patients with LUTS-BPE. Although these results should be confirmed, and the pathophysiology is yet to be completely understood, counseling smokers and MetS patients about the risk of postoperative persistent nocturia is warranted.
