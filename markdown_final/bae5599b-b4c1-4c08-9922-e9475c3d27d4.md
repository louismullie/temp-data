## Question

What are the long-term outcomes of patients receiving gene therapy for sickle cell disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the long-term outcomes of patients receiving gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary evidence base and the specific products studied, especially HGB-206 lovo-cel cohorts and what changed over time [^111yVfK3]. Then, I should examine efficacy stratified by manufacturing generations, including vector copy number (VCN), hemoglobin A-T87Q expression, and clinical outcomes like VOEs and hemolysis markers. Next, I will assess long-term safety with attention to busulfan toxicity, insertional oncogenesis, and clonal hematopoiesis risks. After that, I should compare outcomes and trade-offs with allogeneic HSCT, including the mixed chimerism analogy. Then, I will verify current approvals and guideline positioning, followed by integrating patient preference and quality-of-life data [^114niW12] [^111QL5Pd]. Finally, I will synthesize success factors, highlight remaining uncertainties, and state an evidence-based conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the primary evidence source and the product details, because I need to ensure I am citing the most mature dataset before drawing conclusions [^111e1Xts]. The core data derive from the phase 1/2 HGB-206 study of lovo-cel (bb1111; lovotibeglogene autotemcel), an autologous lentiviral gene addition approach encoding βA-T87Q to produce anti-sickling hemoglobin, with treatment process evolution across cohorts A, B1/B2, and later optimized groups that informed subsequent manufacturing refinements [^111e1Xts] [^111yVfK3]. Wait, let me verify the framing of cohort evolution and endpoints: VCN, HbA-T87Q, HbS fraction, hemolysis markers, and clinical VOE resolution were consistently tracked, and durability beyond 5 years has been reported for earlier cohorts, establishing the foundation for assessing long-term benefit [^111e1Xts].

> I will now examine efficacy stratified by treatment generation, because the generation-dependent outcomes are central to the "long-term outcomes" question [^111e1Xts]. In Group A, VCN and HbA-T87Q were low and clinically inadequate, yet stable over 5.5 years, demonstrating engraftment but minimal clinical benefit and persistent stress erythropoiesis [^111e1Xts]. Hold on, I should verify the later cohorts: process refinements in B1/B2 and subsequent optimized groups drove markedly higher VCN and HbA-T87Q expression, with HbA-T87Q contributing over 40% of total hemoglobin by around 6 months and sustained thereafter, accompanied by VOE resolution, reduction in HbS proportion, and normalization of bilirubin, LDH, and haptoglobin, while reticulocytes improved but did not fully normalize, implying residual low-level hemolysis from uncorrected cells [^115f4ddH]. Let me consider the clinical analogy: this residual hemolysis profile parallels the clinically silent state seen with stable mixed-donor chimerism after HSCT, supporting the concept that a certain fraction of corrected erythropoiesis is sufficient for functional cure phenotypes [^113EEzpa].

> Next, I should review long-term safety, because conditioning risks and leukemogenesis concerns drive clinical decision-making and post-approval surveillance requirements [^111NJ5nU]. The observed toxicity largely reflects busulfan myeloablation and SCD comorbidities rather than vector-related events, and in HGB-206, AML cases in early Group A prompted extensive investigation but were not attributed to insertional oncogenesis, aligning with broader data indicating a higher baseline prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis in SCD that may predispose to therapy-related myeloid malignancy after stem cell manipulation, mandating vigilant surveillance beyond 10 years [^111e1Xts] [^111NJ5nU]. Wait, let me verify consistency across platforms: similar vigilance is emphasized across lentiviral and gene editing strategies, given potential amplification of underlying CH under cytotoxic stress and engraftment dynamics, reinforcing the need for longitudinal registries [^114niW12].

> But wait, what if allogeneic HSCT remains superior in some settings; I need to compare reference outcomes thoughtfully and not jump to conclusions about equivalence without contextualizing risks, availability, and long-term sequelae [^111ug5A7]. Matched sibling donor HSCT has long-standing curative outcomes with high event-free survival, but is limited by donor availability and risks like GVHD, rejection, and chronic immunosuppression, whereas autologous gene therapy avoids GVHD and donor constraints yet still requires myeloablation and carries uncertain late malignancy risks, cost, and access barriers [^111ug5A7] [^112SV8yD]. Let me check the chimerism threshold analogy: sustained HbA-T87Q contributions near or above 40% and corresponding HbS reduction emulate the clinically quiescent state seen with mixed-donor chimerism, supporting "functional cure" at these expression levels in gene therapy recipients [^113EEzpa].

> I should confirm the regulatory status and guidelines to accurately position therapy choices today, because approval and guidance inform real-world adoption and patient selection [^111QL5Pd]. In December 2023, two autologous gene therapies were FDA-approved for severe SCD, including the lentiviral βA-T87Q addition product Lyfgenia and the CRISPR BCL11A enhancer–edited product Casgevy, expanding access beyond trial settings while retaining the necessity for specialized centers and long-term follow-up infrastructures [^114niW12]. Hold on, I should verify current guideline posture: ASH 2021 continues to prioritize matched sibling donor HSCT for eligible severe cases given its track record, suggesting gene therapy primarily for patients lacking suitable donors or when individualized risk-benefit favors autologous approaches, especially at younger ages where transplant outcomes may be optimized with myeloablative conditioning when feasible [^111QL5Pd] [^1163LzYr] [^111e1Xts].

> Let me consider patient preferences and quality-of-life impacts, because acceptability and patient-centered outcomes strongly influence shared decision-making in a risk-tolerant yet uncertain evidence space. Discrete-choice experiments indicate that adults with more severe symptoms accept higher early mortality risks for gene therapy and require lower minimum acceptable benefits than those with milder disease, illustrating how baseline symptom burden modulates risk tolerance and perceived value, while parents of pediatric patients show distinct patterns that also evolve with hypothetical symptom worsening [^113CzR2B] [^1134pubx]. I should double-check HRQOL evidence: systematic data, albeit limited, suggest meaningful improvements across physical and emotional domains after curative therapies like HSCT and emerging gene therapy, reinforcing the salience of patient-reported outcomes in evaluating long-term benefit [^113vJbrd].

> Now, I need to ensure I articulate the key technical success factors, because translational details like VCN thresholds and manufacturing advances underpin durable efficacy and generalizability across centers [^111e1Xts]. Higher VCN and robust, near-pancellular HbA-T87Q expression correlate with sustained clinical remission; iterative manufacturing improvements in HGB-206, including optimized cell collection and processing, appear to set a practical floor for efficacy around VCN greater than 2 with HbA-T87Q contributions exceeding roughly 40% of total hemoglobin, though this threshold remains a pragmatic, cohort-derived signal rather than a formalized universal cutoff, so I should be cautious in over-specifying it [^115f4ddH] [^111WqFSP]. Hold on, I should verify enabling technologies: vector engineering that boosts transduction efficiency and titers, and optimized mobilization such as plerixafor-based collection in SCD, support consistent production of potent autologous products, albeit still within the constraints of myeloablative busulfan conditioning that contributes to fertility and organ toxicity risks [^111UYdff] [^117JrCGH] [^113ehF9Y] [^112w9MBC].

> Let me reconsider the remaining uncertainties and potential mitigations, because these will shape long-term practice patterns and patient counseling [^112vC2h1]. Durability beyond 10 years remains to be proven in large cohorts, and while vector-mediated insertional oncogenesis has not been implicated in the later lovo-cel cohorts, clonal hematopoiesis and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms remain plausible late risks necessitating prolonged surveillance and pre-treatment genomic risk assessment paradigms as they evolve [^111NJ5nU]. I need to check alternatives and innovation paths: efforts toward non-genotoxic conditioning and next-generation editing or gene addition strategies, including erythroid-restricted BCL11A silencing and precise HBB correction, aim to reduce toxicity and broaden eligibility, particularly for younger patients where lifetime benefit may be maximized if safety improves [^114cMGzK] [^111e1Xts] [^115kzFAr]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated the certainty around "curative endpoints" — we still need validated, composite physiological and clinical endpoints to define functional cure across modalities, which is an active area of consensus development [^112vC2h1].

> Synthesis-wise, I should verify that my bottom line aligns with the totality of evidence and the practical constraints health systems face, including affordability and infrastructure, before concluding [^112imCrV]. Modern lovo-cel manufacturing achieves durable biological correction with sustained HbA-T87Q expression, VOE resolution, hemolysis normalization, and stable gene marking at 5+ years in later cohorts, translating to a functional cure phenotype in most treated individuals, while safety signals align with conditioning and baseline SCD marrow biology rather than vector insertion, though very long-term leukemogenic risk remains uncertain and mandates ongoing follow-up [^111e1Xts] [^115f4ddH]. Gene therapy is now a viable curative option, particularly for patients without matched sibling donors or those for whom GVHD risks are unacceptable, but decisions should integrate age, comorbidities, fertility considerations, patient preferences, center expertise, and payer constraints given the high upfront costs and the need for specialized programs and registries for lifelong surveillance [^111ug5A7] [^112imCrV]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: allogeneic HSCT remains appropriate first-line curative therapy for eligible patients with matched sibling donors per ASH guidance, and gene therapy should be framed as complementary rather than universally substitutive, with ongoing data collection to refine long-term comparative effectiveness and safety profiles [^111QL5Pd].

Gene therapy for sickle cell disease demonstrates **durable clinical benefit** with **sustained hemoglobin correction** and marked reductions or elimination of vaso-occlusive events over 3–5 years of follow-up [^111e1Xts]. Most patients achieve stable engraftment and long-term HbA T87Q or HbF expression, with normalization of hemolysis markers and improved quality of life [^115f4ddH] [^113PK36K] [^113vJbrd]. However, there is a **low but significant risk of myeloid malignancy** (AML/MDS) after gene therapy, likely related to conditioning and pre-existing clonal hematopoiesis rather than vector insertion [^111NJ5nU] [^114niW12]. It is essential to conduct **long-term monitoring** to detect late complications [^112vC2h1]. Broader access remains limited by cost, infrastructure, and the need for myeloablative conditioning [^112imCrV] [^116RgsKm] [^114bksoZ] [^111ug5A7].

---

## Clinical efficacy and durability

Gene therapy for SCD demonstrates **significant clinical efficacy**, with sustained correction of the underlying genetic defect and **durable hematologic improvements**:

- **HbA T87Q expression**: In the HGB-206 study, patients treated with lovo-cel achieved sustained HbA T87Q expression, with median levels of 5.2 g/dL at 24 months and 5.4 g/dL at 36 months, corresponding to 40% and 41% of total hemoglobin, respectively.

- **Reduction in vaso-occlusive events**: Gene therapy has resulted in significant reductions or complete elimination of severe vaso-occlusive events (VOEs), with 97% of patients experiencing no severe VOEs after treatment.

- **Normalization of hemolysis markers**: Hemolysis markers, including bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and haptoglobin, normalized in most patients, indicating improved red blood cell survival and reduced hemolysis [^115f4ddH] [^113PK36K].

- **Stable engraftment**: Long-term follow-up (up to 5.5 years) has demonstrated stable engraftment of gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells, with sustained therapeutic hemoglobin production [^111e1Xts] [^115f4ddH].

---

## Quality of life and functional outcomes

Gene therapy is associated with **significant improvements** in quality of life and functional outcomes [^114cMGzK]. Quality of life **improves substantially**, with patients reporting better physical, emotional, and social functioning, reduced pain frequency and severity, improved mobility, and enhanced overall well-being [^113vJbrd] [^112vC2h1]. Many patients achieve **functional independence**, with reduced reliance on chronic transfusions, analgesics, and other supportive therapies [^111e1Xts].

---

## Long-term safety and adverse events

While gene therapy demonstrates significant clinical benefits, **long-term safety concerns remain**, particularly regarding the risk of myeloid malignancies:

- **Myeloid malignancies**: Cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been reported following gene therapy. These malignancies appear to be associated with conditioning regimens and pre-existing clonal hematopoiesis rather than vector insertional mutagenesis [^111NJ5nU] [^114niW12].

- **Clonal hematopoiesis**: Pre-existing clonal hematopoiesis may predispose patients to malignant transformation following conditioning and transplantation, necessitating careful pre-treatment screening and long-term monitoring [^111NJ5nU] [^115DT23i].

- **Other adverse events**: Acute adverse events related to conditioning chemotherapy, such as cytopenias, infections, and mucositis, have been reported but are generally manageable with supportive care [^111e1Xts] [^114nbHZ9].

---

## Comparison with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)

Gene therapy offers several advantages over allogeneic HSCT, including **avoidance of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)** and the use of autologous cells, which eliminates the need for matched donors. However, both approaches carry risks of myeloid malignancies and require myeloablative conditioning [^111NJ5nU] [^114bksoZ] [^111ug5A7].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite promising outcomes, several **limitations and challenges remain**:

- **Limited long-term data**: Follow-up periods are relatively short (3–5 years), and longer-term data are needed to fully assess durability and late adverse events [^114F9GqH] [^116XZBnk] [^112vC2h1].

- **High cost and accessibility**: Gene therapy is expensive and resource-intensive, limiting accessibility, particularly in low-resource settings [^112imCrV] [^116RgsKm] [^111ug5A7].

- **Need for myeloablative conditioning**: Conditioning regimens carry significant risks and may limit eligibility for some patients [^114bksoZ] [^111e1Xts] [^111ug5A7].

### In vivo measurement of RBC survival in patients with sickle cell disease before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^113PK36K]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Currently, there are multiple ongoing clinical trials investigating various methodologies for gene therapy in patients with SCD. Early results from the first group of patients with SCD treated with gene therapy (NCT02140554 using LentiGlobin BB305 [bb1111, lovotibeglogene autotemcel]) (group A, n = 7) demonstrated low peripheral blood vector copy numbers and HbA T87Q production with minimal clinical benefit given sustained stress erythropoiesis. Subsequent improvements to the trial design were made, many of which have been implemented across clinical trials for gene therapy in SCD. Such improvements for those who have received LentiGlobin BB305 (bb1111, lovotibeglogene autotemcel) (group C; N = 35) now demonstrate high and sustained near-pancellular expression of HbA T87Q that was greater than 40% of total Hb by six months after treatment.

Clinically, there was a reduction in HbS, a reduction in the propensity of RBCs to sickle, and resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events. Although total bilirubin, LDH, and haptoglobin levels normalized, ARCs improved but did not normalize, suggesting ongoing host-derived hemolysis from uncorrected or under-corrected RBCs. Despite this, previous data suggest fraction sickled RBCs in patients with HbA T87Q are near those observed in this study in participants with SCD after HSCT with mixed-donor chimerism and similarly remain clinically asymptomatic, suggesting the feasibility of identifying a target chimerism or gene modification level that results in decreased sickling, improved RBC lifespan, and a lack of clinical symptoms after HSCT.

### To pursue gene therapy or not? Is it feasible after graft failure in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^114bksoZ]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Autologous genetically modified hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)–based therapies are now available for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT). These therapies involve the collection of CD34+ HSCs and HSC progenitors (HSCPs) via apheresis from the patient after mobilization into the peripheral blood. The collected HSCPs are then genetically modified with a lentiviral vector or site-directed nucleases. Ultimately, the genetically modified HSCPs are infused back into the patient after bone marrow–ablating chemotherapy. Overall, this is a resource-intensive and high-risk, high-reward therapy that, if successful, can potentially cure certain individuals with severe SCD or TDT.

Although two HSC-based gene therapies are commercially available for individuals with severe SCD who experience frequent vaso-occlusive crises and for those with TDT, respectively, the detailed characteristics that define ideal candidacy for these therapies remain the subject of debate, especially regarding the absolute contraindications. At the time of writing, clinical trials of gene therapy for SCD and TDT have strictly excluded patients who have received a previous HSC-based therapy, such as an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or previous gene therapy. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of a subsequent autologous HSC-based gene therapy for patients who experience graft failure after an allogeneic HCT remain unclear. In this article, we discuss the various factors that may influence shared decision-making regarding whether an individual who has previously undergone…

### A systematic review of quality of life in sickle cell disease and thalassemia after stem cell transplant or gene therapy [^113vJbrd]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia experience several complications across their lifespan that lead to impairment in different health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains. There is increasing interest in curative therapies for patients with SCD and thalassemia, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy; however, the effect of these therapies on various HRQOL domains remains unclear.

Our objective was to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence for the effect of HSCT and gene therapy on HRQOL in patients with SCD and thalassemia. A systematic search of medical literature databases was conducted. A total of 16 studies (thalassemia, n = 9; SCD, n = 6; both, n = 1) involving 517 participants met inclusion criteria (thalassemia, n = 416; SCD, n = 101).

- **HSCT effects**: HSCT was associated with small to large positive effects in most HRQOL domains (Cohen's d; mean = 0.47; median = 0.37; range, 0.27–2.05). In thalassemia, HSCT was frequently associated with large positive effects in physical and emotional HRQOL domains (median d = 0.79 and d = 0.57, respectively). In SCD, HSCT was associated with large positive effects in all HRQOL domains.

- **Gene therapy outcomes**: Emerging data suggest improvement in HRQOL outcomes across different domains following gene therapy in thalassemia and SCD.

The quality of evidence was moderate in 13 studies (81%). HSCT has a positive impact on several HRQOL domains in patients with SCD and thalassemia; however, more longitudinal studies are warranted to assess the sustainability of these effects. Reporting HRQOL outcomes from ongoing studies is crucial to provide a more comprehensive understanding of long-term impacts.

### Knowledge to date on secondary malignancy following hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease [^111NJ5nU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2022). Low credibility.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, gene therapy, and gene editing offer a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Unfortunately, the development of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia has been higher than expected after graft rejection following nonmyeloablative conditioning and lentivirus-based gene therapy employing myeloablative busulfan for SCD. Somatic mutations discovered in 2 of 76 patients who rejected their grafts were identified at baseline at much lower levels. While whole-genome sequencing analysis reported no difference between patients with SCD and controls, a study including whole-exome sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis in individuals with SCD compared with controls.

Genetic risk factors for myeloid malignancy development after curative therapy for SCD are currently being explored. Once discovered, decisions could be made about whether gene therapy may be feasible versus allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, which results in full donor chimerism. In the meantime, care should be taken to perform a benefit/risk assessment to help patients identify the best curative approach for them. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for myeloid malignancies and other adverse effects of curative therapies for SCD.

### Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study [^111e1Xts]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

Lovo-cel (bb1111; LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease [SCD]) gene therapy (GT) comprises autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified β-globin gene (βA-T87Q) to produce anti-sickling hemoglobin (HbA T87Q). The efficacy and safety of lovo-cel for SCD are being evaluated in the ongoing phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02140554). The treatment process evolved over time, using learnings from outcomes in the initial patients to optimize lovo-cel's benefit-risk profile.

- **Group A findings**: Following modest expression of HbA T87Q in the initial patients (Group A, n = 7), alterations were made to the treatment process for patients subsequently enrolled in Group B (n = 2, patients B1 and B2), including improvements to cell collection and lovo-cel manufacturing. After six months, median Group A peripheral blood vector copy number (≥ 0.08 c/dg) and HbA T87Q levels (≥ 0.46 g/dL) were inadequate for a substantial clinical effect but stable and sustained over 5.5 years.

- **Group B improvements**: Both metrics markedly improved in Group B (patient B1: ≥ 0.53 c/dg and ≥ 2.69 g/dL; patient B2: ≥ 2.14 c/dg and ≥ 6.40 g/dL, respectively) and generated improved biologic and clinical efficacy in Group B, including higher total hemoglobin and decreased hemolysis.

- **Safety assessment**: The safety of the lovo-cel for SCD treatment regimen largely reflected the known side effects of HSPC collection, busulfan conditioning regimen, and underlying SCD. Acute myeloid leukemia was observed in two patients in Group A and deemed unlikely related to insertional oncogenesis.

### A budget impact analysis of gene therapy for sickle cell disease: an updated analysis [^112imCrV]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

To the editor:

In December 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two gene therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD). The data demonstrated substantial short-term clinical improvement. Approximately half of the 100,000 individuals in the United States with SCD are Medicaid enrollees. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a well-described cure for the hemoglobinopathy, although its use is limited due to donor availability and toxicity.

Prices for gene therapies have made headlines, whereas the payment timing and uncertainty in treatment durability compound the challenge for payers. The two new approvals for SCD apply to a population far larger than any existing commercial gene therapy.

We previously published a model exploring the budget impact of a gene therapy for SCD for ten Medicaid plans, projecting an affordability challenge. Even cost-effective therapies with exceptional clinical benefit may prove unaffordable for payers balancing short-term budgets.

### Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease - current practice and new approaches [^112SV8yD]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that affects over 5 million people worldwide. Maintenance therapy has been successful in reducing complications and enhancing life expectancy, yet subclinical complications persist. At the time of writing, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) remains the only available curative therapy for sickle cell disease. With declining incidences of rejection and transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival after human leucocyte antigen-identical sibling transplant exceeds 90%. However, the majority of individuals with sickle cell disease do not have a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling; therefore, research is expanding to focus on new approaches to alternative donor transplant.

Advances in supportive care and conditioning regimens have led to the expansion of the pool of donors to unrelated donors and haploidentical donors. Challenges remain in improving the safety and efficacy of HSCT from alternate donors. Early results from gene therapy may provide another curative option in patients with sickle cell disease. These approaches show early promise, but larger, longitudinal studies are needed to better determine the optimal clinical circumstances for transplant in sickle cell disease.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease [^117SK1BT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele and a second abnormal allele that can allow abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as sickle cell disease, are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease; and to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 15 August 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2, or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found.

- **Main results**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported.

### Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease [^11285UC6]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Several factors may be contributing to the high-risk tolerances observed in our study. First, it is possible that respondents considered the level of uncertainty around efficacy measures. In the survey, we presented scenarios of efficacy and risks out of 10 patients treated with gene therapy. Respondents could have reasonably surmised that the level of efficacy could vary dramatically as the number of patients treated increased beyond 10. This is potentially a real issue given the currently limited evidence collected through trials for gene therapy.

Second, respondents in group B who reported that the patient experienced a stroke at baseline were asked to suppose the patient experienced another stroke with sequelae. Previous work suggests such an event is very impactful and potentially more so than death.

Third, media attention to successful gene-therapy interventions around the time of data collection could have triggered some level of hope for better outcomes among respondents. Finally, caregivers could have been reacting to the issues experienced when their child's SCD symptoms were most severe. Although short-term survival among children with SCD is not as big of a concern, the stress and pain of VOCs could have led caregivers to focus on avoiding serious quality-of-life issues through gene therapy.

### Safe and efficient peripheral blood stem cell collection in patients with sickle cell disease using plerixafor [^113ehF9Y]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is potentially curative for sickle cell disease (SCD); however, options for HSC collection are limited in this population, and investigation of the collection, efficiency, and safety of peripheral blood (PB) mobilization with plerixafor from start to finish is needed. Here we describe consistent, safe, and sufficient PB HSC collection and processing after plerixafor mobilization from the greatest number of participants reported at the time of writing and the first two-institutional study. Our data suggest plerixafor mobilized HSC in SCD are enriched for long-term engrafting HSC, which is not true of HSC from SCD bone marrow (BM), supporting a paradigm shift in the optimal HSC source for patients with SCD.

This open-label phase I study was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03226691). All participants provided written informed consent for a protocol approved by each institution's Institutional Review Board. Hydroxyurea (HU) was stopped at least two weeks prior to mobilization, and all participants received red blood cell exchange the day prior to mobilization and collection to target < 30% sickle hemoglobin (HbS).

Participants received a single subcutaneous dose (240 mg/kg) of plerixafor (Mozobil™ Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) four hours before leukapheresis. Participants in the NIH cohort also received 325 mg aspirin. If the minimum target CD34+ cell collection was not achieved, additional interventions were considered.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease [^111w1DVw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele, and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal hemoglobin polymerization leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders (such as sickle cell disease) are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease, and to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register was 21 July 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2, or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found.

- **Main results**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported.

### American society of hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: transfusion support [^117C35qV]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sickle cell disease, specifically concerning technical considerations for transfusion, the ASH 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining an extended red cell antigen profile by genotype or serology, instead of only ABO/RhD typing, in all patients with SCD (all genotypes) at the earliest opportunity, optimally before the first transfusion.

### Post-transcriptional genetic silencing to treat sickle cell disease [^114nbHZ9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, pain, and progressive organ damage. A high level of erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin (HbF), comprising α- and γ-globins, may ameliorate these manifestations by mitigating sickle hemoglobin polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. BCL11A is a repressor of γ-globin expression and HbF production in adult erythrocytes. Its down-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for inducing HbF.

- **Methods**: We enrolled patients with sickle cell disease in a single-center, open-label pilot study. The investigational therapy involved the infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BCH-BB694 lentiviral vector, which encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting BCL11A mRNA embedded in a microRNA (shmiR). This allows erythroid lineage-specific knockdown. Patients were assessed for primary endpoints of engraftment and safety, and for hematologic and clinical responses to treatment.

- **Results**: As of October 2020, six patients had been followed for at least 6 months after receiving BCH-BB694 gene therapy, with a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 7 to 29). All patients had engraftment, and adverse events were consistent with the effects of the preparative chemotherapy. All the patients who could be fully evaluated achieved robust and stable HbF induction (percentage HbF/(F+S) at most recent follow-up, 20.4 to 41.3%), with HbF broadly distributed in red cells (F-cells 58.9 to 93.6% of untransfused red cells) and HbF per F-cell of 9.0 to 18.6 pg per cell. Clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease were reduced or absent during the follow-up period.

### Gene therapy for HbSC disease and other compound heterozygous sickle hemoglobinopathies: A time for inclusion [^116x2Qp5]. Blood (2025). Low credibility.

Two gene therapy products have been FDA approved for sickle cell disease. Nearly all patients in the clinical trials that led to approval were either sickle hemoglobin gene homozygotes (sickle cell anemia) or had HbS-β0 thalassemia. HbSC disease, caused by compound heterozygosity for HbS and HbC genes, is the second most common genotype of sickle cell disease. Gene therapy has not been tested in HbSC disease patients who are severely symptomatic. We discuss the pathophysiology and clinical features of HbSC disease and how gene therapy is likely to provide a curative option for some individuals. We also discuss the mechanism through which HbF and HbF-like HbA (HbAT87Q) might mitigate adverse clinical outcomes and end-organ damage in HbSC disease and other compound heterozygous sickle hemoglobinopathies.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease [^116XZBnk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal hemoglobin polymerization leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as sickle cell disease, are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease, and to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries. The date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register was 21 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2, or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found.

- **Main results**: No trials of gene therapy have been conducted for sickle cell disease.

### Development of a forward-oriented therapeutic lentiviral vector for hemoglobin disorders [^111UYdff]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Reverse-oriented globin vectors can drive phenotypic correction in mouse models for both β-thalassemia and SCD. Although initial gene therapy trials for β-thalassemia and SCD are encouraging, they also demonstrate the need to improve these results by optimizing target cell collection, processing, and transduction. Indeed, lower than anticipated gene transfer levels in preliminary gene therapy trials are likely the result of reduced vector copy number (VCN), as reverse-oriented globin vectors have lower vector titers and lower transduction efficiency in primary human HSCs, which limits their clinical prospects. We hypothesized that reverse orientation impedes both viral preparation and vector transduction.

In this report, we describe a forward-oriented globin-expressing vector that retains intron 2, achieves high vector titers, and results in efficient transduction of human HSCs in vitro and in xenograft mice and rhesus HSCs in vivo.

### Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease [^113CzR2B]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Proclivity for gene therapy can be evaluated through the relative preference weights for positive chances of eliminating SCD symptoms. The distance between these weights and the weight for a 0% chance of eliminating symptoms conveys the intensity of preference for treatment. Adult patients in group A (i.e. mild symptom severity) were less likely to accept gene therapy at Baseline compared to group B adults. Interest in gene therapy increased substantially as adult respondents in group A were asked to suppose they experienced worse symptoms (i.e. had chronic pain, ≥ 5 pain crises, and a stroke without long-term sequelae). Adult patients in group B were more likely than those in group A to accept gene therapy with any of the efficacy levels presented in the choice questions. Among parents of patients, we found no difference in their proclivity for gene therapy across Baseline levels (i.e.g.roup A at baseline vs. group B at baseline). The likelihood of choosing gene therapy with the supposed worsened state increased more for group B than group A among parents, and more for group A than group B among adult patients.

- **Minimum acceptable benefits (MAB)**: Figure 4 reports the MABs required of gene therapies with 10% and 30% chances of death within 1 year after treatment by adult patients and parents. The MABs corresponded to respondents' choices assuming their symptoms and with "worsened" symptoms. To accept a 10% chance of death, adult patients with their symptoms in group A required a MAB of 67% (95% CI, 20–97) whereas those in group B only required 34% (95% CI, 16–77).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sickle cell disease, specifically concerning stem cell transplantation, the ASH 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of HLA-identical sibling cord blood when available. This is preferred if it is associated with an adequate cord blood cell dose and good viability over bone marrow.

### Allogeneic cellular gene therapy in hemoglobinopathies — evaluation of hematopoietic SCT in sickle cell anemia [^116uupxp]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Many patients with thalassemia have been cured with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) since the first successful transplant in 1981. Allogeneic stem cell gene therapy is currently the only treatment option for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). A total of 11 patients, with a median age of 12 years (ranging from 2 to 16), affected by SCA, received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from HLA-identical related donors following a myeloablative-conditioning regimen. Indications for transplantation included vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, avascular bone necrosis, chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, or hemorrhagic stroke.

All patients experienced sustained engraftment. One patient became a stable mixed chimera, with 25% of donor cells at four years after transplantation. One patient died one year post-transplantation. The probability of survival, SCA-free survival, and treatment-related mortality (TRM) at five years post-transplant were 90%, 90%, and 10%, respectively. All 10 surviving patients remained free of any SCA-related events following transplantation.

In conclusion, these data confirm that SCT from a suitable HLA-matched related donor should become the primary option for curing children with SCA due to its excellent survival rates and the potential for a return to normal life, free from SCA-related events.

### Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease [^1134pubx]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Of the 266 adult patients and 114 parents of pediatric patients screened, 180 (68%) and 114 (100%) met the study inclusion criteria, respectively. The DCE survey was completed by 178 (99%) adult patients and 111 (97%) parents. Four adult patients and 2 parents were regarded as inattentive to the content of the choice questions as they always chose "Gene Therapy A" or "Gene Therapy B" across all 13 questions. These individuals were excluded from data analysis.

- **Characteristics of the study samples**: Table 3 reports characteristics of the study samples representing 174 adult patients and 109 parents. The average age of adult patients was 34 years. Approximately 73% were female, 97% were Black or African American, and 40% held at least a bachelor's degree. The average age of parents was 40 years. Approximately 79% were female, 94% were Black or African American, and 31% held at least a bachelor's degree.

Adult patients reported an average of 3 pain crises that required medical attention in the 12 months before the survey. Fifty-eight percent of patients experienced some level of continued pain for at least 6 months. Approximately 20% of the patients had an ACS episode at some point in the past. Seven adults (4%) reported having had a stroke in the 12 months before taking the survey, of which 2 resulted in permanent mental disability and/or physical disability.

The average age of the pediatric patients was approximately 9 years, and 47% were female. Parents of these patients reported that their children had experienced an average of 1 pain crisis that required attention.

### Globalization in clinical drug development for sickle cell disease [^115xEdDs]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Clinical research issues**: The rationale for testing a new medicine in different geographical settings is strong, particularly for polygenic disorders, as other genes may come into play in various populations. However, there is also rationale in the case of a monogenic disorder like sickle cell disease (SCD), because multiple factors in different environments can influence the clinical course of the disease. Therefore, in principle, the response to certain treatments may vary.

Hydroxyurea was approved in 1998 by the US FDA for "symptomatic sickle cell anemia (SCA) in adults", and it has since become the standard of care for both adults and children with SCD. Initially, there was some reluctance to introduce hydroxyurea into geographical regions where SCD is most prevalent, and where conditions such as malnutrition, endemic malaria, and other infectious diseases coexist. This paradoxical reluctance was due in part to excessive and misplaced fear of treatment-related side effects, including drug toxicities, malignancies, sterility, and insufficient education of health workers. The need to provide evidence for the benefits of hydroxyurea in such settings led to the conception of the NOHARM (NCT01976416) and REACH (NCT01966731) trials. These two prospective studies have assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of hydroxyurea in Africa. They have proven that, as expected, hydroxyurea is both safe and efficacious for the management of patients with SCD, wherever they live.

The choice of study endpoints also merits attention. In the case of voxelotor, a significant increase in hemoglobin was demonstrated.

### Investigational curative gene therapy approaches to sickle cell disease [^112e1b6K]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood condition resulting from abnormal hemoglobin production. It is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. The clinical manifestations are variable and range from acute and debilitating painful crises to life-threatening pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic complications. The only curative treatment of SCD at this time is bone marrow transplantation (also called hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) using healthy blood stem cells from an unaffected brother or sister, or from an unrelated donor if one can be identified who is a match in tissue typing. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients with sickle cell disease has such a donor available.

Use of autologous hematopoietic stem cells and alternative types of genetic modifications is currently under study in clinical research trials for this disease. The approaches include the use of viral vectors to express globin genes that are modified to prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization, or to express interfering RNAs to "flip the switch" in adult red cells from adult β-sickle hemoglobin to fetal hemoglobin using a physiologic switch. Several gene-editing approaches aim to induce fetal hemoglobin or correct/modify the actual sickle mutation.

In this audio review, we will discuss these different approaches and review the progress of curative therapy for SCD using gene therapy.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease [^114F9GqH]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT, including the lack of suitable donors, graft-versus-host disease, the need for immune suppression, and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for SCD has been made over the past several decades, with a growing number of clinical trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising as a potentially curative strategy. Efforts are focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of SCD.

### Development of a forward-oriented therapeutic lentiviral vector for hemoglobin disorders [^115EwGVN]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is being evaluated for hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapeutic globin vectors have demanding requirements, including high-efficiency transduction at the HSC level and high-level, erythroid-specific expression with long-term persistence. The requirement of intron 2 for high-level β-globin expression dictates a reverse-oriented globin-expression cassette to prevent its loss from RNA splicing. Reverse-oriented globin vectors can drive phenotypic correction, but they are limited by low vector titers and low transduction efficiencies.

Here we report a clinically relevant forward-oriented β-globin-expressing vector, which has sixfold higher vector titers and four to tenfold higher transduction efficiency for long-term hematopoietic repopulating cells in humanized mice and rhesus macaques. The insertion of the Rev response element (RRE) allows intron 2 to be retained, and β-globin production is observed in transplanted macaques and human SCD CD34+ cells. These findings bring us closer to a widely applicable gene therapy for hemoglobin disorders.

### Best practices in gene therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^1134S19H]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) are inherited blood disorders caused by pathogenic variants of the β-globin gene. Historically, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors has been the only curative option. However, as most patients with SCD or TDT lack HLA-matched donors, autologous or patient-derived HSCT can provide an alternative, transformative option. Gene therapy-based autologous HSCT for the treatment of SCD and TDT entails a complex patient journey and requires the careful implementation of numerous policies and procedures. As gene therapies for these diseases are now commercially available, there is great value in institutions with developed and implemented approaches sharing their best practices. Here, we describe standardized approaches and best practices for the optimized implementation of gene therapies based on our experience in administering this novel class of medicines.

### Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^111Xy4x5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders, resulting from the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), which often involves a single transfusion episode. Alternatively, RBC transfusions can be part of a regular long-term transfusion program to prevent SCD complications.

- **Objectives**: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews regarding the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.

- **Methods**: We included Cochrane Reviews of randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.

- **Main results**: We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions, and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomized to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews, only 10 participants were randomized with no usable data.

### Extensive multilineage analysis in patients with mixed chimerism after allogeneic transplantation for sickle cell disease: Insight into hematopoiesis and engraftment thresholds for gene therapy [^113EEzpa]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the majority of our patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) will develop mixed chimerism, as defined in the Methods section. This condition is associated with a sufficient level of disease control and represents an ideal setting for investigating the reconstitution of the hematopoietic lineages following HSCT and the minimum level of correction required to prevent the recurrence of clinical signs of SCD.

Chimerism analysis of total white blood cells (WBC) is frequently used to evaluate donor cell engraftment following HSCT. However, in the context of mixed chimerism, this tool does not provide an exhaustive analysis of donor engraftment. The present study is the first to feature detailed, simultaneous analyses of chimerism in several different mature myeloid and lymphoid subpopulations, as well as erythroid and myeloid progenitors/precursors and peripheral red blood cells (RBC) in a large cohort of patients who have undergone myeloablative conditioning.

When simultaneously analyzing the donor/recipient origin of different hematologic lineages, we observed a linear correlation between CD15+/CD14+, CD15+/CD19+, and CD14+/CD19+ cells; this was also observed in our gene therapy trials (unpublished data). Chimerism of CD3+ cells was not correlated with other cell populations. With the exception of the subgroup of patients with the lowest levels of recipient chimerism, which included the three symptomatic patients, individuals had a lower percentage of donor cells in the CD3+ population than in the other lineages. Hence, T-cell reconstitution appears to be independent of the other lineages. An alternative explanation could be considered for these observations.

### Sickle cell anaemia therapy in 2025 [^114ymG29]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

New pharmacological therapies for sickle cell anaemia have not proven as efficacious as hoped, while the widespread application of curative stem cell and gene therapies is not likely to occur soon. This situation raises the question of whether more attention should now be devoted to the use of hydroxyurea in this disease.

### Gene replacement therapy for sickle cell disease and other blood disorders [^111o4c9B]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated that sickle cell disease (SCD) can be corrected in mouse models by transduction of hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors containing anti-sickling globin genes, followed by transplantation of these cells into syngeneic recipients. Although self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors, with or without insulator elements, should provide a safe and effective treatment in humans, some concerns about insertional mutagenesis persist. An ideal correction would involve the replacement of the sickle globin gene (betaS) with a normal copy of the gene (betaA).

We recently derived embryonic stem (ES) cells from a novel knockin mouse model of SCD and tested a protocol for correcting the sickle mutation by homologous recombination. Animals derived after gene replacement produced high levels of normal human hemoglobin (HbA), and the pathology associated with SCD was corrected. These experiments provided a foundation for similar studies in which our group collaborated with Rudolf Jaenisch's laboratory to correct SCD by gene replacement in iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells derived by direct reprogramming of sickle skin fibroblasts.

Corrected iPS cells were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitors that were transplanted into irradiated sickle recipients. The transplanted animals produced high levels of normal human HbA, and the pathology of SCD was corrected. These proof-of-principle studies provide a foundation for the development of gene replacement therapy for human patients with SCD and other blood disorders.

### Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease [^115ViPKS]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Another limitation is that some respondents had to self-report the severity of the symptoms, and we cannot ascertain with certainty if what they reported was reflective of their actual clinical severity. Nonetheless, the questions used in the survey to classify baseline severity were reviewed by clinical experts and further tested with patients during in-person interviews before fielding the survey. Furthermore, we used a convenience sample for this study, and the sample may not be completely generalizable to the US SCD population. Yet, our study sample generally reflects a greater prevalence of chronic pain and disability among adults compared to children with SCD.

Although pediatric patients can have serious and life-threatening complications, their incidence has decreased compared to historical levels owing to effective screening and prevention measures. Thus, our study provides preliminary insights into risk tolerance toward gene therapy, especially among caregivers of pediatric patients who are less likely to manifest the chronic complications of SCD associated with end organ damage and have lower health care use.

Finally, our survey included information about gene therapy based on knowledge available at the time of the study. Understanding of gene therapy outcomes is continually evolving, and our study findings may not capture the full spectrum of differences between gene therapies and other treatment options. For example, a description of the possibility of infertility as a result of myeloablative conditioning was included, but we did not alter the likelihood of future outcomes based on this information.

### Stem cell therapy for sickle cell disease: transplantation and gene therapy [^116XdJRF]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) has a strong track record of efficacy, and there is growing appreciation that its benefits exceed its risks in selected individuals. In contrast, the clinical utility of replacement gene therapy for sickle cell disease remains unproven. Its challenge is to ensure viral transduction into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and to generate safe, stable, erythroid-specific replacement gene expression at a level that is sufficient to have a clinical effect.

The clinical necessity for fulfilling all these criteria may make this genetic disorder among the most complex to treat successfully by gene therapy. However, the experience with HCT for SCD has proven that eliminating the beta(S)-globin gene is curative when the transfer is stable. Thus, replacement gene therapy for sickle cell disease remains a subject of intense interest and investigation.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for sickle cell disease: Stem cell transplantation [^112w9MBC]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sickle cell disease, specifically in relation to stem cell transplantation, the ASH 2021 guidelines recommend considering myeloablative conditioning over reduced-intensity conditioning that includes melphalan or fludarabine regimens. This recommendation applies to pediatric patients with SCD who have an indication for allogeneic HSCT and a matched sibling donor.

### Is allogeneic transplantation for sickle cell disease still relevant in the era of gene therapy [^111ug5A7]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disease. Disease-modifying therapy and supportive care have improved the survival of children with SCD in the United States and Europe. Yet, adults with SCD continue to face high risks of morbidity and early death. Recently, two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved genetic therapies offer the potential for a short-term decrease in acute vaso-occlusive pain events, if not complete cure. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is also curative but, until recently, was constrained by limited donor availability and the risks of graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection, and death. Importantly, recent advances have attenuated these barriers.

Here, we discuss the state of therapies with curative intent for SCD. Both genetic therapy and allo-HCT offer the potential for curing most individuals with SCD. However, the cost (approximately five times higher), the need for myeloablation, and associated late-health effects may make genetic therapies less favorable choices than allo-HCT.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Where we are now [^1132kz2k]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

The landscape of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD. Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative or highly disease-modifying option for abating the complications of the disease. Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their endpoints, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the long-term use of this therapy.

### Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study [^111yVfK3]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

- **Study design and overview**: HGB‐206 is an ongoing phase 1/2, non‐randomized, open‐label, multi‐site, single‐dose clinical study of lovo‐cel for SCD and is the largest study of GT in SCD at the time of writing. HGB‐206 is being conducted at 11 sites across the United States in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Enrolled patients completed a written informed consent form prior to screening.

HGB‐206 was initiated as a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) of lovo‐cel, and to assess the risk–benefit profile in patients with SCD. The study has been subsequently updated to a phase 1/2 registrational study to evaluate efficacy endpoints (NCT02140554; Trial: HGB‐206).

### Is allogeneic transplantation for sickle cell disease still relevant in the era of gene therapy [^117P8zGH]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

In contrast, the need for myeloablation, cost, insurance company restrictions on its use, and the (at the time of writing) poorly defined risk of posttransplant AML/MDS may significantly limit the availability of genetic therapy approaches. It is certainly possible that future advancements, such as the development of noncytotoxic conditioning that will allow the engraftment of autologous stem cells, could make gene therapies less toxic.

The optimal curative therapy choice for an individual with SCD remains to be defined. Moving forward, the curative therapy selection is not likely to be based on the 2-year survival or amelioration of acute vaso-occlusive pain events. The clinical decision as to which curative therapy for an individual with SCD is selected will likely be determined based on the individual's age, the family's choice, insurance coverage, the ability to tolerate myeloablative therapy, and the yet-to-be-determined late health effects. Late health effects may include infertility, AML/MDS, and progressive heart, lung, and kidney disease, which are the major causes of death in adults with SCD.

Questions also remain regarding which individuals should be considered for curative approaches as well as the optimal timing. For example, most children with SCD currently do well with supportive care. Ongoing development of new disease-modifying approaches could also influence decisions regarding therapies with curative potential. Moreover, ongoing advances will continue to lessen complications and improve availability.

### Non-viral DNA delivery and TALEN editing correct the sickle cell mutation in hematopoietic stem cells [^113tKQeW]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease is a devastating blood disorder that originates from a single point mutation in the HBB gene coding for hemoglobin. Here, we develop a GMP-compatible TALEN-mediated gene editing process enabling efficient HBB correction via a DNA repair template while minimizing risks associated with HBB inactivation. Comparing viral versus non-viral DNA repair template delivery in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vitro, both strategies achieve comparable HBB correction and result in over 50% expression of normal adult hemoglobin in red blood cells without inducing β-thalassemic phenotype.

In an immunodeficient female mouse model, transplanted cells edited with the non-viral strategy exhibit higher engraftment and gene correction levels compared to those edited with the viral strategy. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that non-viral DNA repair template delivery mitigates P53-mediated toxicity and preserves high levels of long-term hematopoietic stem cells. This work paves the way for TALEN-based autologous gene therapy for sickle cell disease.

### Reduction in vaso-occlusive events following stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease [^113uFf7a]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Early preliminary data after autologous gene therapy for SCD suggest a similar significant reduction and/or elimination of SCD-related clinical events after gene therapy; however, a direct comparison with the patients included in this study is cautioned. The nonmyeloablative protocols at the NIH were specifically designed to broaden the scope of patients with SCD who are eligible for curative therapy and included older, sicker patients with increased comorbid conditions who would otherwise be unable to tolerate myeloablative therapy. In the allogeneic setting, frequent pain despite hydroxyurea treatment and other SCD supportive care is an acceptable indication for HSCT in patients with an HLA-matched sibling donor. However, the pain was often not the sole indication for HSCT in this study, and the rates of pre-HSCT pain in patients referred to the NIH may not be reflective of the general adult sickle cell population.

Patients treated at the NIH often had multiple comorbid conditions in addition to frequent pain, whereas patients treated at the CNH were younger and had less pain, presumably due to less accumulation of organ injury resulting from repeated VOEs. This is in contrast to autologous gene therapy trials, which are currently limited to patients who meet strict inclusion criteria, are primarily characterized by severe recurrent vaso-occlusive events as an easily measurable efficacy endpoint, and often exclude sicker patients who may otherwise meet the eligibility criteria for allogeneic curative strategies. For example, patients who were eligible and underwent HSCT at NIH often…

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease [^1118gqna]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as sickle cell disease, are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease, and to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and from searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register was conducted on 21 June 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials, including any relevant phase 1, 2, or 3 trials, of gene therapy for individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found.

- **Main results**: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported.

- **Authors' conclusions**: No randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials were available.

### Gene therapy of hemoglobinopathies: progress and future challenges [^116f8QWb]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Recently, gene therapy clinical trials have been successfully applied to hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia. Among the significant discoveries that led to the development of genetic approaches to cure these disorders is the identification of the β-globin locus control region and several associated transcription factors that determine hemoglobin switching and enable high-level, erythroid-specific expression of genes at the β-globin locus. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that lentiviral vectors are efficient tools for inserting large DNA elements into non-dividing hematopoietic stem cells, demonstrating reassuringly safe integration profiles. Alternatively, genome editing could restore the expression of fetal hemoglobin or target specific mutations to restore the expression of the wild-type β-globin gene.

The most recent clinical trials for β-thalassemia and SCD are showing promising outcomes; patients were able to discontinue transfusions or had reduced transfusion requirements. However, toxic myeloablation and the high cost of ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy platforms present a barrier to the widespread application of these approaches. In this review, we summarize these gene therapy strategies and ongoing clinical trials. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to improve outcomes, reduce myeloablative regimens, and address future challenges to decrease the cost of gene therapy platforms.

### Um171 enhances fitness and engraftment of gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells from patients with sickle cell disease [^114niW12]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a challenge in the landscape of genetic disorders, affecting millions worldwide. SCD is characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin that leads to acute and chronic pain, hemolytic anemia, and end-organ damage with significantly reduced life expectancy. Autologous gene therapy has emerged as a promising disease-modifying therapy with significant strides in recent years, including two recently approved commercial products using distinct approaches to treatment (Casgevy and Lyfgenia).

Ex vivo gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) involves harvesting a patient's HSCs, genetically modifying these cells to mitigate the erythrocyte cellular phenotype of sickle hemoglobin polymerization, and subsequently transplanting them back into the patient. Several different lentiviral vectors (LVVs)-based approaches have proven effective in clinical trials. However, the occurrence of myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, seemingly unrelated to vector insertional mutagenesis, has prompted further scrutiny and adjustments in the manufacturing process. This emphasizes the critical importance of rigorous safety measures in advancing genetic therapies for complex diseases such as SCD. Notably, the occurrence of oncogenesis has highlighted the still undefined possibility of an underlying predisposition to cancer in patients with SCD that may be amplified with the stress of ex vivo manipulation and in vivo reconstitution. In the present work, we used a lentiviral shmiR vector targeting BCL11A.

### Sickle cell anaemia therapy in 2025 [^116KrwS8]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients might also benefit from developing other oral agents to increase fetal haemoglobin, as noted in a recent commentary in Science, accompanying the report of a potential new relevant epigenetic pathway. It is now understood that such agents are only likely to be efficacious if they can achieve fairly pan-cellular levels of fetal haemoglobin, above about 25% of red cell haemoglobin species, at acceptably safe dosing. Studies of other ways to directly improve the flow of sickle haemoglobin polymer-containing cells in the microcirculation also deserve high priority. Continued primary attention to the many other abnormal phenomena that can be detected in the blood of sickle cell patients is much less likely to result in strong therapeutic results compared to approaches that interfere with the primary pathophysiological mechanisms.

Indeed, the use of pain, namely, vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), as the prime or even sole parameter for judging the success of an agent for approval as a medication, in contrast to measures of organ damage or mortality itself, has not been validated. First, the persistence of pain has been noted even in individuals apparently genetically 'cured' of their disease. Second, it is not clear that various clinical attributes always track together or that lowering the frequency or duration of VOCs will correct many of the other serious manifestations of this disease. Further studies on the relationships among these disease manifestations — stroke, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, renal failure, etc. — with VOCs are also necessary.

### The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease [^114cMGzK]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy. Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), continue to play a critical role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents also show promise.

In the past five years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this review, we discuss the treatment landscape for pediatric sickle cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income and middle-income countries.

### Development of β-globin gene correction in human hematopoietic stem cells as a potential durable treatment for sickle cell disease [^115kzFAr]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common serious monogenic disease, with 300,000 births annually worldwide. It is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from a single point mutation in codon six of the β-globin gene (HBB). Ex vivo β-globin gene correction in autologous patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) may potentially provide a curative treatment for SCD. We previously developed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting strategy that uses high-fidelity Cas9 precomplexed with chemically modified guide RNAs to induce recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV6)-mediated HBB gene correction of the SCD-causing mutation in HSPCs.

Here, we demonstrate the preclinical feasibility, efficacy, and toxicology of HBB gene correction in plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells from healthy and SCD patient donors (gcHBB-SCD). We achieved up to 60% HBB allelic correction in clinical-scale gcHBB-SCD manufacturing. After transplantation into immunodeficient NSG mice, 20% gene correction was achieved with multilineage engraftment. The long-term safety, tumorigenicity, and toxicology study demonstrated no evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis, genotoxicity, or tumorigenicity from the engrafted gcHBB-SCD drug product. Together, these preclinical data support the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of this gene correction strategy for the initiation of a phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with SCD.

### Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease compared to the United States population [^113N2Zjn]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative but is associated with life-threatening complications, most of which occur within the first two years after transplantation. In the era of interest in gene therapy and gene editing, we felt it timely to report on sickle cell disease transplant recipients who were alive for at least two years after transplantation, a group not previously reported.

Our objectives were to:

- **Report the conditional survival rates**: Patients who were alive for two or more years after transplantation.
- **Identify risk factors**: Determining risk factors for death beyond two years after transplantation.
- **Compare all-cause mortality risks**: Comparison with an age-, sex-, and race-matched general population in the United States.

By focusing on two-year survivors, we exclude deaths occurring as a direct consequence of the transplantation procedure. De-identified records of 1,149 patients were reviewed from a publicly available data source, with 950 patients deemed eligible. All analyses were conducted in a secure cloud environment using the available statistical software packages. The validity of the public database was confirmed by reproducing results from an earlier publication.

Conditional survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method for the sub-cohort that survived a given length of time after transplantation. Cox regression models were constructed to identify risk factors associated with mortality beyond two years post-transplantation.

### Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study [^115f4ddH]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

- **Biologic efficacy**: PB VCN stabilized in all patients by 6 months after lovo-cel infusion and remained stable through to the date of last follow-up, suggesting that vector-positive, long-term repopulating stem cells are capable of sustaining long-term erythropoiesis with HbA T87Q production (Figure 2A). From 6 months through the last visit, there were marked improvements in biologic efficacy parameters in the Group B1 patient, and to a greater extent in the Group B2 patient, compared with Group A.

	- First, PB VCN was ≥ 0.08, ≥ 0.53, and ≥ 2.14 c/dg from Month 6 through to the last visit in Groups A, B1, and B2, respectively (Figure 2A); a similar trend was observed in the percentage of LVV+ cells over time (Figure S3). Second, the improved PB VCN generated an increase in HbA T87Q production of ≥ 0.46, ≥ 2.69, and ≥ 6.40 g/dL from Month 6 through to the last visit in Groups A, B1, and B2, respectively (Figure 2B). Third, HbA T87Q expression was durable across Groups A, B1, and B2, contributing to 12%, 35%, and 54% of total Hb, respectively, at the last visit (independent of transfusion) (Figure 2C).

	- Fourth, increased HbA T87Q production reduced the HbS fraction to 69%, 55%, and 46% of total Hb in non-transfused patients at the last visit in Groups A, B1, and B2, respectively (Figure 2C). Finally, increased HbA T87Q production also corresponded with increased total Hb of ≥ 8.90, ≥ 9.80, and ≥ 12.30 g/dL from Month 6 through to the last visit in Groups A, B1, and B2, respectively (Figure 2D). Of interest, HbF levels increased by as much as 1.42, 1.36, and 0.11 g/dL within 2–6 months after lovo-cel infusion in Groups A, B1, and B2.

### Gene therapy for sickle cell disease [^112Wgeaw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

### Defining curative endpoints for sickle cell disease in the era of gene therapy and gene editing [^112vC2h1]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based treatments for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are entering clinical trials. These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of SCD, have the potential to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

However, as these novel approaches advance from early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional cure for SCD. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of SCD and treatment options, review ongoing SCD clinical trials using gene therapy or gene editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the attainment of a functional cure for SCD.

### The challenge of eliciting opinions of gene therapy for SCD [^113HhSXA]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

In this issue of Blood Advances, Gonzalez Sepulveda et al. describe respondents' preferred treatment options as they pertain to gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). Gene therapy, an autologous form of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in which a patient with SCD serves as their stem cell donor, is a curative strategy in several ongoing clinical trials. There is a wave of enthusiasm for gene therapy for SCD. In this report, the authors use a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to tackle the challenge of understanding how adult patients and parents of patients with SCD approach the risk-benefit analysis and make decisions regarding the acceptability of gene therapy. The authors' aim is twofold: first, to understand patient acceptance of potential risks and benefits early in gene therapy technology development, presumably to ensure gene therapy can be designed with knowledge of an acceptable risk-benefit ratio, and second, to understand how disease severity affects risk assessment and risk aversion.

A DCE survey instrument was administered to adult patients with SCD and parents of pediatric patients with SCD. The survey asked study participants to choose between pairs of hypothetical gene therapies, which were defined by varying degrees of effectiveness and risk of toxicity. A third option, "no gene therapy", was also available for participants to choose, representing outcomes of standard-of-care therapy. Respondents also answered questions about their symptom severity and, based on their answers, were categorized as either group A (mild SCD symptoms) or group B.

### To pursue gene therapy or not? Is it feasible after graft failure in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^114sLGbc]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Two autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapies (GTs) are now commercially available for severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT). However, the safety and efficacy of a subsequent autologous HSC-based GT after graft failure with a previous allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains unclear. Some individuals who have experienced a failed first attempt at a potentially curative therapy might seek a second opportunity for cure via GT.

In this article, various factors related to patient and HSC health that may influence feasibility are discussed, along with shared decision-making processes regarding whether an individual who has previously received an allogeneic HCT and experienced graft failure could consider an autologous GT. Exposure to chronic inflammatory stress and conditioning chemotherapy may compromise HSC fitness, reduce hematopoietic reserve, accelerate HSC aging, and promote the accumulation of deleterious genetic mutations, all of which may adversely affect the safety and efficacy of the GT.

### A budget impact analysis of gene therapy for sickle cell disease: The Medicaid perspective [^116RgsKm]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Hundreds of gene therapies are undergoing clinical testing and are likely to be priced at more than $1 million per course of treatment. The association between high prices and insurance coverage of gene therapy remains unclear. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease has shown early success and could be one of the first gene therapies available for a relatively large population.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the budget impact and affordability of gene therapy for severe sickle cell disease from the perspective of US Medicaid programs with the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease while exploring the impact of an annuity payment model.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A budget impact analysis was performed from January 1 to May 31, 2020, for sickle cell disease gene therapy from the perspective of 10 state Medicaid plans with a 5-year time horizon, using state-level disease prevalence data from 2012. Disease prevalence, Medicaid enrollment, and expenditures were derived from the available literature. The eligible population was based on modified clinical trial inclusion criteria, including individuals aged 13 to 45 years with severe disease.

- **Exposures**: The gene therapy was assumed to be administered to 7% of the eligible population annually and was considered curative (no subsequent disease-related expenditures). The gene therapy price was $1.85 million in the base case, and baseline disease-related expenditures were $42,200 per year.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcomes were total budget impact and budget impact per member per month in years 1 through 5.

### Development of a forward-oriented therapeutic lentiviral vector for hemoglobin disorders [^117JrCGH]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Currently, reverse-oriented globin vectors are used in all gene therapy trials for hemoglobin disorders, including β-thalassemia and SCD. In preliminary gene therapy trials, partial therapeutic effects, such as the reduction of RBC transfusion, were observed for β-thalassemia patients. However, once higher levels of gene transfer were obtained, attributed to improved transduction efficiency among individuals, improvements were seen in β-thalassemia and in a single SCD subject. This demonstrates the importance of efficient transduction for improving the prospects of gene therapy in hemoglobin disorders. Improving transduction efficiency of HSCs is even more critical in gene therapy for SCD compared to β-thalassemia, as marking levels have thus far been lower in SCD gene therapy trials. Furthermore, β-globin protein levels achieved by reverse-oriented vectors at the time of writing may be insufficient to overcome the pathogenic effects of sickle globin, which are not mitigated by the gene addition approach.

The more efficient transduction of CD34+ cells in vitro and in vivo achieved with our forward-oriented globin vector should advance gene therapy for hemoglobin disorders by allowing us to achieve transduction levels required for broad success in SCD. In parallel, we, along with others, are investigating other promising strategies to increase transduction efficiency in gene therapy for SCD. We previously optimized conditions for CD34+ cell transduction with lentiviral vectors using a xenograft mouse model and demonstrated efficient long-term gene expression.

### Is allogeneic transplantation for sickle cell disease still relevant in the era of gene therapy [^115DT23i]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Leukemia after potentially curative therapy for SCD:

Two patients in the lovo-cel trial exhibited findings consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), such as anemia, abnormal erythroid precursors on bone marrow examination, and trisomy 8 chromosomal abnormality. However, neither patient officially received that diagnosis at the time of publication. Moreover, in initial studies with lovo-cel, 2 out of 9 patients developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These cases of AML/MDS after SCD gene therapy do not appear to be directly related to prior hydroxyurea therapy, myeloablative busulfan conditioning, or insertional mutagenesis after ex vivo manipulation. Alternatively, the marrow cells from patients with SCD may have an increased propensity for malignant transformation after transplantation.

Several reports indicate that donor cell AML/MDS after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) usually arises from clonal hematopoiesis (CH) present in the donor. This is often observed in patients undergoing allo-HCT with older donors, frequently with a CH variant allele frequency below the standard detection level of 2%-5%. Similarly, AML/MDS that occurs after autologous transplantation for lymphomas appears to arise from CH clones present in the patient's marrow before transplant. The cumulative incidence of AML/MDS after autologous transplantation for patients with lymphomas and pretransplant CH is nearly 20%. The median time to the development of AML/MDS is 3 to 4 years post-transplant, but the risk persists for at least 10 years. CH is a common age-related condition but is unusual before age.
