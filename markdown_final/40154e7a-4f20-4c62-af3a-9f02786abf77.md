## Question

Effexor and lexapro to help anxiety

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Effexor (venlafaxine) and Lexapro (escitalopram) can be used together for anxiety, and if so, how to approach dosing, efficacy, tolerability, and safety, including monitoring and tapering considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indications of each drug. Then, I should verify the interaction risk, especially serotonin syndrome. Next, I will review comparative efficacy and tolerability from head-to-head and meta-analytic data. After that, I need to check dosing ranges and titration schedules for each agent. Finally, I should confirm boxed warnings, monitoring requirements, and a practical, stepwise clinical recommendation with contingencies for switching versus augmentation, and tapering strategies if needed.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Lexapro is an SSRI with FDA-labeled indications for generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, and it is commonly used off-label for panic disorder and social anxiety disorder, with typical adult dosing of 10–20 mg daily and a usual starting dose of 10 mg daily, titrated after at least 1 week based on response and tolerability [^1132W2Sg] [^115XmvMt] [^115KGbLg] [^115WpDH7] [^111NNuem]. Effexor XR is an SNRI with FDA-labeled indications for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and major depressive disorder, with typical adult dosing starting at 37.5–75 mg daily and titrating up to 225 mg daily in 75 mg increments at intervals of at least 4 days, often with food to improve tolerability [^116Q9yoq] [^114QdbLZ] [^112FvFTa] [^111JvhoV] [^116ZeAkh].

> Wait, let me verify the key interaction before anything else. Combining an SSRI and an SNRI increases serotonin activity and raises the risk of serotonin syndrome; DrugBank explicitly flags venlafaxine plus escitalopram as increasing the risk or severity of serotonin syndrome, so co-administration is not routine and requires a compelling rationale and close monitoring if considered at all [^113XpKLx]. I should also confirm that both agents carry boxed warnings for suicidality, especially in younger adults, mandating vigilant monitoring during initiation and dose changes, which further complicates dual serotonergic therapy decisions [^111biMkr] [^111Qvi8A] [^111rgZMo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy differences without data. Head-to-head randomized data in generalized anxiety disorder show both escitalopram and venlafaxine XR are effective versus placebo, with venlafaxine XR showing a numerically larger mean HAM-A reduction and statistical separation on some analyses, while escitalopram demonstrated better tolerability with fewer discontinuations for adverse events, supporting the notion that venlafaxine may have a slight efficacy edge but at the cost of tolerability [^114wq6aw]. Let me double-check broader syntheses: network meta-analyses and contemporary reviews consistently place SSRIs and SNRIs among first-line pharmacotherapies for GAD, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder, with modest-to-moderate effect sizes versus placebo, reinforcing that either monotherapy is reasonable depending on patient factors [^116gFJxg] [^115bhSGJ].

> I need to check tolerability profiles carefully. Escitalopram's most common adverse effects include nausea, insomnia, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and somnolence, and pooled analyses suggest relatively favorable discontinuation rates compared with several comparators, including venlafaxine, which aligns with clinical experience of better overall tolerability for many patients on SSRIs [^116ZootJ] [^114dNRWi]. Venlafaxine XR commonly causes nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, somnolence, sweating, and dose-dependent blood pressure elevation; discontinuation for adverse events is more frequent than with placebo and can exceed escitalopram's discontinuation rates in comparative studies, which matters when considering long-term adherence [^115Q6vaw] [^111AEZ9N] [^111feSLP].

> Let me consider dosing and titration specifics to avoid errors. For escitalopram, start 10 mg once daily, consider 5 mg in sensitive patients, and titrate to 20 mg after at least 1 week if needed; in older adults or those with hepatic impairment, 10 mg daily is typically sufficient, and renal impairment generally does not require adjustment except at very low creatinine clearance where data are limited [^112yaUQo]. For venlafaxine XR, start 37.5–75 mg once daily with food, increase by up to 75 mg at intervals of at least 4 days, and titrate to 75–225 mg daily for anxiety indications; for GAD, 75 mg is often effective, though some patients require higher doses, and for SAD, 75 mg is the usual target with no clear added benefit above that dose [^116ZeAkh] [^114QdbLZ] [^112FvFTa] [^116Q9yoq].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is about combining them rather than choosing one. I should confirm that routine co-prescription is not recommended due to serotonin syndrome risk and the absence of robust evidence supporting SSRI+SNRI augmentation for anxiety disorders; if a patient has failed multiple adequate monotherapy trials, a cautious, off-label augmentation could be considered only with specialist oversight, explicit informed consent, and a clear monitoring plan, recognizing that this remains a high-risk strategy without definitive supportive data for anxiety outcomes [^113XpKLx]. If combination is contemplated, I would ensure no other serotonergic agents are present, start low and go slow, and monitor closely for autonomic changes, clonus, hyperreflexia, agitation, and mental status shifts that could herald serotonin toxicity [^113XpKLx].

> Next, I should review safety monitoring and boxed warnings. Both drugs carry suicidality warnings, so I need to monitor mood, sleep, agitation, and suicidal ideation, especially in patients under 25 and during dose changes; family education and early follow-up are essential, and any emergent suicidality warrants immediate reassessment and potential medication modification [^111biMkr] [^111Qvi8A] [^111rgZMo]. I should also confirm that venlafaxine can elevate blood pressure and heart rate, so baseline and periodic BP/HR checks are prudent, and I must avoid abrupt discontinuation of either agent to mitigate discontinuation symptoms, planning gradual tapers when stopping therapy [^114NrLAU] [^116hn1Vy].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First-line should be monotherapy selection tailored to comorbidity, prior response, and patient preference: escitalopram is often favored for tolerability and simplicity, whereas venlafaxine may be preferred when there is coexisting depression with prominent psychic anxiety or when prior SSRI trials have failed, acknowledging its higher propensity for adverse effects and BP effects [^115bhSGJ] [^114wq6aw]. If a patient fails an adequate SSRI trial, switching to an SNRI (or vice versa) is generally preferred over combination due to safety; if multiple adequate monotherapy trials fail, augmentation with non-serotonergic agents or psychotherapy should be prioritized before considering dual serotonergic therapy, which remains a last-resort, high-supervision strategy [^113XpKLx].

> I should double-check tapering guidance to avoid common pitfalls. For escitalopram, taper over at least 1–2 weeks, longer if higher doses or longer durations, adjusting to tolerability and symptom recurrence risk; for venlafaxine XR, taper by 75 mg decrements at weekly intervals or slower to reduce discontinuation symptoms, with longer tapers at higher doses or prolonged use, and monitor for rebound anxiety or mood symptoms during dose reductions [^111absYG] [^114NrLAU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. Effexor and Lexapro are both effective first-line options for anxiety disorders, but they should not be combined routinely due to serotonin syndrome risk; choose one based on individual patient factors, monitor closely for adverse effects and suicidality, and reserve any dual serotonergic strategy for exceptional circumstances with specialist oversight and explicit risk–benefit documentation [^113XpKLx] [^115bhSGJ] [^116gFJxg].

---

Effexor (venlafaxine) and Lexapro (escitalopram) are both **first-line treatments** for anxiety disorders, with **distinct mechanisms and side-effect profiles** [^115bhSGJ]. Venlafaxine (SNRI) may offer faster relief and greater efficacy in severe anxiety or treatment-resistant cases [^116f2kT2], but it carries a higher risk of discontinuation symptoms and blood pressure elevation [^114NrLAU]. Escitalopram (SSRI) is **better tolerated**, with fewer discontinuation symptoms and less impact on blood pressure, making it a preferred first choice for many patients, especially those with cardiovascular risk or sensitivity to side effects [^114dNRWi] [^113PKWUq]. Both require **careful monitoring** for suicidal ideation, serotonin syndrome, and withdrawal symptoms, and the choice should be individualized based on patient characteristics and preferences [^115Xjo3o].

---

## Mechanisms of action

| **Attribute** | **Venlafaxine (effexor)** | **Escitalopram (lexapro)** |
|-|-|-|
| Class | Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) | Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) |
| Primary mechanism | Inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their levels in the brain | Selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake, increasing serotonin levels |
| Clinical implication | Dual action may provide broader anxiolytic effects, particularly in patients with coexisting depression or treatment-resistant anxiety | Highly selective serotonin action, often associated with fewer side effects and better tolerability |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Both venlafaxine and escitalopram have **demonstrated efficacy** in treating anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and panic disorder (PD) [^115bhSGJ].

- **Venlafaxine**: Clinical trials have consistently shown venlafaxine to be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, with some studies suggesting a faster onset of action compared to SSRIs. Venlafaxine has also demonstrated efficacy in treatment-resistant cases and in patients with coexisting depression.

- **Escitalopram**: Escitalopram has also shown significant efficacy in treating anxiety disorders, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. It is particularly effective in patients with coexisting depression and anxiety.

---

## Side effects and tolerability

| **Side effect** | **Venlafaxine (effexor)** | **Escitalopram (lexapro)** |
|-|-|-|
| Common side effects | - Nausea <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Dry mouth <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Headache <br/> - Sexual dysfunction <br/> - Increased blood pressure | - Nausea <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Sexual dysfunction <br/> - Headache <br/> - Dry mouth |
| Discontinuation symptoms | Higher risk of withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, irritability, dizziness, and electric shock sensations | Lower risk of discontinuation symptoms, generally better tolerated during withdrawal |
| Cardiovascular effects | - Elevated blood pressure <br/> - Increased heart rate <br/> - Caution advised in patients with cardiovascular conditions | Minimal cardiovascular effects <br/> - Generally safer for patients with cardiovascular risk factors |

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Comorbid depression**: Both medications are effective in treating coexisting depression and anxiety. Venlafaxine may be preferred in patients with more severe depressive symptoms due to its dual mechanism of action.

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Escitalopram is generally preferred for patients with cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing hypertension, as venlafaxine can elevate blood pressure and heart rate.

- **Tolerance and side effects**: Escitalopram is often preferred for patients who are sensitive to side effects or have experienced significant discontinuation symptoms with other antidepressants.

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Both medications have been associated with potential risks during pregnancy and lactation. Escitalopram may be preferred due to a more favorable safety profile, but decisions should be individualized and made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines generally recommend both venlafaxine and escitalopram as **first-line treatments** for anxiety disorders [^notfound]. The choice between the two should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and preferences [^115bhSGJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Venlafaxine and escitalopram are both effective treatments for **anxiety disorders**, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Venlafaxine may be more suitable for patients with severe anxiety, coexisting depression, or treatment-resistant cases, while **escitalopram** is generally better tolerated and preferred for patients with cardiovascular risk factors or sensitivity to side effects. The choice between the two should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, and both medications require careful monitoring for side effects, withdrawal symptoms, and **suicidal ideation**.

17.1 Information for Patients

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Lexapro.

General Information about Medication Guide

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Lexapro and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Lexapro. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Lexapro.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lexapro® is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for:

Acute and Maintenance Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents aged 12–17 years (1.1)
Acute Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults (1.2)

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Lexapro (escitalopram) is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Lexapro is indicated for the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^111absYG]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers [see also Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Prescriptions for Lexapro should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

14.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The efficacy of Lexapro in the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was demonstrated in three, 8-week, multicenter, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies that compared Lexapro 10–20 mg/day to placebo in adult outpatients between 18 and 80 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD. In all three studies, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).

There were too few patients in differing ethnic and age groups to adequately assess whether or not Lexapro has differential effects in these groups. There was no difference in response to Lexapro between men and women.

14.2	Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The efficacy of Effexor XR as a treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (75 to 225 mg per day), one 6-month, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study (75 to 225 mg per day), and one 6-month, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day) in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD.

In one 8-week study, Effexor XR demonstrated superiority over placebo for the 75, 150, and 225 mg per day doses as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. However, the 75 and 150 mg per day doses were not as consistently effective as the highest dose (study 1). A second 8-week study evaluating doses of 75 and 150 mg per day and placebo showed that both doses were more effective than placebo on some of these same outcomes; however, the 75 mg per day dose was more consistently effective than the 150 mg per day dose (study 2). A dose-response relationship for effectiveness in GAD was not clearly established in the 75 to 225 mg per day dose range studied.

Two 6-month studies, one evaluating Effexor XR doses of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day (study 3) and the other evaluating Effexor XR doses of 75 to 225 mg per day (study 4), showed that daily doses of 75 mg or higher were more effective than placebo on the HAM-A total, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the CGI scale during 6 months of treatment. While there was also evidence for superiority over placebo for the 37.5 mg per day dose, this dose was not as consistently effective as the higher doses.

Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.

14.3	Social Anxiety Disorder (Also Known as Social Phobia)

The efficacy of Effexor XR as a treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) was established in four double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies (studies 1–4) and one double-blind, parallel-group, 6-month, placebo-controlled, fixed/flexible-dose study, which included doses in a range of 75 to 225 mg per day in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD (study 5).

In these five studies, Effexor XR was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score. There was no evidence for any greater effectiveness of the 150 to 225 mg per day group compared to the 75 mg per day group in the 6-month study.

Examination of subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of age or race on outcome in these studies.

14.4	Panic Disorder

The efficacy of Effexor XR as a treatment for Panic Disorder (PD) was established in two double-blind, 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for PD, with or without agoraphobia. Patients received fixed doses of 75 or 150 mg per day in one study (study 1) and 75 or 225 mg per day in the other study (study 2).

Efficacy was assessed on the basis of outcomes in three variables: (1) percentage of patients free of full-symptom panic attacks on the Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale (PAAS); (2) mean change from baseline to endpoint on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) total score; and (3) percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale. In these two studies, Effexor XR was statistically significantly more effective than placebo (for each fixed dose) on all three endpoints, but a dose-response relationship was not clearly established.

Examination of subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of age or race on outcome in these studies.

In a longer term study (study 3), adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for PD who had responded during a 12-week open phase with Effexor XR (75 to 225 mg per day) were randomly assigned to continue the same Effexor XR dose (75, 150, or 225 mg) or switch to placebo for observation for relapse under double-blind conditions. Response during the open phase was defined as ≤ 1 full-symptom panic attack per week during the last 2 weeks of the open phase and a CGI Improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as having 2 or more full-symptom panic attacks per week for 2 consecutive weeks or having discontinued due to loss of effectiveness as determined by the investigators during the study. Randomized patients were in response status for a mean time of 34 days prior to being randomized. In the randomized phase following the 12-week open-label period, patients receiving continued Effexor XR experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse.

Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment

Combined across short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for all indications, 12% of the 3,558 patients who received Effexor XR (37.5–225 mg) discontinued treatment due to an adverse experience, compared with 4% of the 2,197 placebo-treated patients in those studies.

The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in ≥ 1% of the Effexor XR treated patients in the short-term studies (up to 12 weeks) across indications are shown in Table 7.

Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-controlled Studies

The number of patients receiving multiple doses of Effexor XR during the premarketing assessment for each approved indication is shown in Table 8. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in all development programs varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient (Effexor only) and outpatient studies, fixed-dose, and titration studies.

The incidences of common adverse reactions (those that occurred in ≥ 2% of Effexor XR treated patients [357 MDD patients, 1,381 GAD patients, 819 SAD patients, and 1,001 PD patients] and more frequently than placebo) in Effexor XR treated patients in short-term, placebo-controlled, fixed- and flexible-dose clinical studies (doses 37.5 to 225 mg per day) are shown in Table 9.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Escitalopram oral solution should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.

2.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adolescents

The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution (10 mg/day to 20 mg/day) demonstrated the effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks.

Adults

The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of escitalopram oral solution, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of continuing escitalopram oral solution 10 mg/day or 20 mg/day in adult patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking escitalopram oral solution during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use escitalopram oral solution for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adults

The recommended starting dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week.

Maintenance Treatment

Generalized anxiety disorder is recognized as a chronic condition. The efficacy of escitalopram oral solution in the treatment of GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. The physician who elects to use escitalopram oral solution for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Escitalopram Oral Solution

Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram oral solution or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

14.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults was demonstrated in three, 8-week, multicenter, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies that compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients between 18 and 80 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD. In all three studies, Lexapro showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).

There were too few patients in differing ethnic and age groups to adequately assess whether or not Lexapro has differential effects in these groups. There was no difference in response to Lexapro between men and women.

Pediatric Patients 7 years of age and older

The efficacy of Lexapro in the treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-V criteria for GAD. The primary outcome was change from baseline to Week 8 in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) severity score for GAD. In this study, Lexapro showed a statistically significant treatment difference when compared to placebo on the PARS severity score for GAD (Least squares mean difference: −1.42, 95% confidence interval [−2.69, −0.15]).

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Escitalopram is excreted in human breast milk. Limited data from women taking 10–20 mg escitalopram showed that exclusively breast-fed infants receive approximately 3.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of escitalopram and 1.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of desmethylcitalopram. There were two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a racemic citalopram-treated mother; in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of racemic citalopram by its mother and, in the second case, no follow-up information was available. Caution should be exercised and breastfeeding infants should be observed for adverse reactions when Lexapro is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has not been established in pediatric patients (less than 12 years of age) with Major Depressive Disorder. Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has been established in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) for the treatment of major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients with Major Depressive Disorder has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.

Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Decrease appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as Lexapro.

### Venlafaxine ER as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: pooled analysis of five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^114U3ZVA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Concerns about the safety of benzodiazepines in older adults may have led investigators and clinicians to underestimate the importance of adequately treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in later life. To evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of an alternative treatment in older patients, we conducted a secondary analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of extended release venlafaxine (venlafaxine ER, Effexor XR) for adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of GAD.

Design

The five multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials used similar designs to evaluate short-term efficacy after 8 weeks. In addition, two studies evaluated efficacy and safety over 24 weeks under double-blind conditions.

Setting

Outpatients from both primary care and specialty mental healthcare settings were included. Three studies were conducted in the United States and two in Europe.

Participants

Intention-to-treat analyses included 1,839 adult outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD and total scores of ≥ 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA). Ten percent of the patients were aged 60 and older and 5.0% were aged 65 and older.

Intervention

Fixed or flexible doses of venlafaxine ER in the dose range of 37.5 to 225 mg/day or matched placebo were used for 8 weeks in all studies and for 24 weeks in two studies.

Measurements

Primary efficacy variables included the HAMA total score and psychic anxiety factor, the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). Secondary efficacy variables included the HAMA somatic anxiety factor, the depression subscale of the HAD, CGI-3 severity, the Covi Scale for Anxiety, and the Raskin Scale for Depression.

Results

On the CGI, 66% of older patients (≥ 60 years) responded to venlafaxine ER, compared with 41% for placebo (P < .01 by logistic regression). For younger patients (< 60 years), comparable figures were 67% and 44%, respectively (P < .001). Analysis of variance showed no main effects for age and no age-by-treatment interactions for any of the primary or secondary efficacy outcome measures for either the 8- or 24-week analyses. Within the older adults subgroup, increasing age did not influence responses. In this cohort of GAD patients, higher levels of depression were associated with decreased responses of anxiety symptoms. In older adults, 23% of venlafaxine ER patients discontinued treatment prematurely versus 31% of those who received placebo; comparable figures for younger adult patients were 27% and 28%, respectively. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 15% versus 14% for venlafaxine ER and placebo, respectively, in older adults compared with 15% versus 8%, respectively, for younger adults.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine ER is equally safe and well tolerated by and shows similar efficacy in younger and older patients in the treatment of GAD.

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Lexapro, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Venlafaxine extended-release tablets should be administered in a single dose with food either in the morning or in the evening at approximately the same time each day. Each tablet should be swallowed whole with fluid and not divided, crushed, chewed, or placed in water.

2.1 Initial Treatment

Major Depressive Disorder

For most patients, the recommended starting dose for venlafaxineextended-release tablets is 75 mg/day, administered in a single dose. In the clinical trials establishing the efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in moderately depressed outpatients, the initial dose of venlafaxine was 75 mg/day. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 37.5 mg/day for 4 to 7 days to allow new patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 75 mg/day. While the relationship between dose and antidepressant response for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules has not been adequately explored, patients not responding to the initial 75 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg/day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg/day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 4 days, since steady state plasma levels of venlafaxine and its major metabolites are achieved in most patients by day 4. In the clinical trials establishing efficacy, upward titration was permitted at intervals of 2 weeks or more; the average doses were about 140 to 180 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14)].

It should be noted that, while the maximum recommended dose for moderately depressed outpatients is also 225 mg/day for venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets, more severely depressed inpatients in one study of the development program for that product responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day (range of 150 to 375 mg/day). Whether or not higher doses of venlafaxineextended-release tablets are needed for more severely depressed patients is unknown; however, the experience with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule doses higher than 225 mg/day is very limited.

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

The recommended dose is 75 mg/day, administered in a single dose. There was no evidence that higher doses confer any additional benefit.

### Screening for anxiety disorders in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115Xjo3o]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — Two randomized clinical trials (n = 918) directly evaluated screening for anxiety disorders in primary care adults, and neither trial found differences in anxiety, depressive, or general psychological symptom severity at 13 to 22 weeks of follow-up. Regarding treatment, 24 RCTs (n = 5307) and 8 systematic reviews (44 RCTs; n = 11 030) assessed psychological interventions; in primary care patients with anxiety disorders they showed a small but statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptom severity (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.41 [95%CI, −0.58 to −0.23]) but not in mixed anxiety/depression populations (SMD, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.39 to 0.03]). Existing systematic reviews reported reduced anxiety symptoms, including SMD among persons with generalized anxiety disorder of −0.80 [95% CI, −0.93 to −0.67], and functional status improvements (SMD, −0.63 [95% CI, −0.83 to −0.43]; 33 RCTs [n = 3063]). In older adults, only 7 RCTs (n = 215) were found with a pooled SMD of −0.66 (95% CI, −0.94 to −0.38). Pharmacotherapy evidence in primary care included only 2 RCTs (venlafaxine and escitalopram), both showing a benefit; broader reviews reported improved outcomes with antidepressants versus placebo, with generalized anxiety disorder SMD for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors of −0.66 (95% CI, −0.90 to −0.43; 23 studies [n = 2142]).

### Escitalopram (Lexapro) [^111CJ4qm]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of Lexapro as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg daily Lexapro and 20 mg daily Lexapro to placebo and 40 mg daily citalopram. The 10 mg daily and 20 mg daily Lexapro treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg Lexapro groups were similar on this outcome measure.

In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg daily Lexapro and placebo, the 10 mg daily Lexapro treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

In a flexible-dose study, comparing Lexapro, titrated between 10 mg and 20 mg daily, to placebo and citalopram, titrated between 20 mg and 40 mg daily, the Lexapro treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro for the treatment of major depressive disorder have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of Lexapro for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of Lexapro was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open- label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for Lexapro.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have been established in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older. Use of Lexapro for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared Lexapro 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with GAD [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety of Lexapro was similar to adult patients with GAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.1 General Administration Information

Administer venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules as a single dose with food, either in the morning or in the evening at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Swallow capsules whole with fluid. Do not divide, crush, chew, or place in water.

The capsule may also be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a spoonful of applesauce. This drug/food mixture should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of water to ensure complete swallowing of the pellets (spheroids).

2.2 Major Depressive Disorder

For most patients, the recommended starting dose for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 37.5 mg per day for 4 to 7 days to allow new patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 75 mg per day. Patients not responding to the initial 75 mg per day dose may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of 225 mg per day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 4 days. In the clinical studies establishing efficacy, upward titration was permitted at intervals of 2 weeks or more.

2.3 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

For most patients, the recommended starting dose for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 37.5 mg per day for 4 to 7 days to allow new patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 75 mg per day. Patients not responding to the initial 75 mg per day dose may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of 225 mg per day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 4 days.

2.4 Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

The recommended dose is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose. There was no evidence that higher doses confer any additional benefit.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram and venlafaxine XR in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [^114wq6aw]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent and disabling condition. Escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR) both are indicated for the treatment of GAD. Outpatients (ages 18–65 years) with DSM-IV-defined GAD (Hamilton Anxiety Scale [HAMA] ≥ 20) were eligible to participate in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, flexible-dose trial. Following randomization, patients received 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram (10–20 mg/day; N = 127), venlafaxine XR (75–225 mg/day; N = 129), or placebo (N = 136). The primary efficacy parameter was mean change from baseline at week 8 in HAMA total score, using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach. Secondary efficacy parameters were HAMA psychic anxiety subscale, Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Treatment was completed by 77% of patients. The least square mean difference for change from baseline at week 8 in HAMA total score for escitalopram and venlafaxine XR versus placebo were -1.52 (P = 0.09) and -2.27 (P = 0.01), respectively, for LOCF, and -1.92 (P = 0.033) and -3.02 (P = 0.001), respectively, for Observed Cases (OC). On all secondary parameters, both active treatments were significantly superior to placebo on the LOCF and OC analyses. Discontinuation due to adverse events was not different for escitalopram versus placebo (7 versus 5%, P = 0.61), but was significantly greater for venlafaxine XR (13%) versus placebo (P = 0.03). Venlafaxine XR, but not escitalopram, separated from placebo on the primary efficacy measure, using the LOCF approach. However, overall efficacy analyses suggest that escitalopram and venlafaxine XR are both effective treatments for GAD. Escitalopram was better tolerated.

### Venlafaxine: a 2003 update [^116dYuBh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

venlafaxine has been available for use as an antidepressant in the United States for a decade.

Objective

Comprehensive reviews of venlafaxine have been published elsewhere; thus, this update focuses on newer issues of treatment remission in depression, treatment-resistant depression, and extended-release venlafaxine for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Methods

Relevant clinical literature from 1993 through 2003 was identified from database searches of MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and from manual searches of reference lists of the identified papers. Search terms included venlafaxine extended-release, venlafaxine XR, treatment-resistant depression, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and antidepressive agents second generation.

Results

With its dual action of serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, venlafaxine has been shown to be superior in efficacy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for severe major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and depressive symptom remission. Its demonstrated efficacy for both short- and long-term treatment of GAD has led to its use for obsessive-compulsive disorder and chronic pain syndromes, although inadequate clinical literature currently exists to support these latter 2 uses. In the past decade, no new or unexpected adverse events have been identified with venlafaxine therapy, except a possibly greater risk of fatal overdose compared with other serotonergic drugs, suggesting the need for caution in patients with suicidal ideation. Because venlafaxine is a potent serotonin agonist, caution must also be exercised to prevent the possibility of serotonin syndrome when used with other serotonin agonists, and its dose should be tapered very gradually to minimize the risk of a serotonin withdrawal reaction.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine has emerged as a successful post-SSRI-era antidepressant with an expanded range of uses since it was first marketed.

### Specific SSRIs and birth defects: Bayesian analysis to interpret new data in the context of previous reports [^117CPjoG]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

SSRI use

During the interview for the NBDPS, no specific question addressed depression. Mothers were asked if they had any illnesses other than the ones already discussed (for example, hypertension or diabetes) and whether they took any medication for the illness. Women could report depression here, which would then be followed by a question about any medications taken for the illness. There were also specific medication related questions: "between three months before conception and [the baby's] date of birth, did you take any of the following medications? Prozac? Paxil? Zoloft? Celexa?" There was no specific question for Lexapro. For this analysis, we considered women exposed if they reported taking citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft) at least once in the period from one month before conception through the third month of pregnancy. Women who reported taking more than one type of SSRI were only included in the multiple SSRI category. We considered women as unexposed if they did not take any antidepressants in the period from three months before to the end of the pregnancy and did not report any depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder. Women who did not answer all medication related questions, used SSRIs in a period other than the period of interest, or took antidepressants other than SSRIs (for example, bupropion and venlafaxine) were excluded.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets should be administered in a single dose with food either in the morning or in the evening at approximately the same time each day. Each tablet should be swallowed whole with fluid and not divided, crushed, chewed, or placed in water.

2.1 Initial Treatment

Major Depressive Disorder

For most patients, the recommended starting dose for Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets is 75 mg/day, administered in a single dose. In the clinical trials establishing the efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in moderately depressed outpatients, the initial dose of venlafaxine was 75 mg/day. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 37.5 mg/day for 4 to 7 days, to allow new patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 75 mg/day. While the relationship between dose and antidepressant response for venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules has not been adequately explored, patients not responding to the initial 75 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg/day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg/day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 4 days, since steady state plasma levels of venlafaxine and its major metabolites are achieved in most patients by day 4. In the clinical trials establishing efficacy, upward titration was permitted at intervals of 2 weeks or more; the average doses were about 140 to 180 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14)].

It should be noted that, while the maximum recommended dose for moderately depressed outpatients is also 225 mg/day for venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets, more severely depressed inpatients in one study of the development program for that product responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day (range of 150 to 375 mg/day). Whether or not higher doses of Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are needed for more severely depressed patients is unknown; however, the experience with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule doses higher than 225 mg/day is very limited.

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

The recommended dose is 75 mg/day, administered in a single dose. There was no evidence that higher doses confer any additional benefit.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116BnShD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anxiety and depressive disorders

What do I do if a young person has depression and has not responded to two SSRIs and CBT?

National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines currently recommend CBT as a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe depression, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line antidepressant and, if that is not effective, sertraline or citalopram. There is limited evidence for other treatments beyond this, other than interpersonal psychotherapy, which is often not available.

The first thing to do when a patient is treatment-resistant is to revisit the formulation and diagnosis. Is this really depression, or does the pattern of symptoms since you started seeing the patient suggest a personality disorder as a more appropriate diagnosis? Are there any social factors that have not been addressed?

Then review whether the patient has indeed had all the treatments to which they appear to be 'resistant'. Did they stop fluoxetine after a few days of mild side effects and would they be prepared to try again? Did they have a good number of sessions of evidence-based psychological therapy from a fully trained and supervised therapist? If they stopped after a few sessions, was this due to a problem in the therapy or the therapist and would they consider trying a different therapist?

If the patient truly does have depression, and you have tried all the evidence-based treatments, there is no evidence to guide you. It would be reasonable to try two SSRIs up to the maximum tolerated dose, within BNF limits: although there is no evidence in favour of or against this, there is some evidence for a dose increase in adult depression; and there is plenty of safety data from paediatric OCD studies which use high doses of SSRIs. If the patient is nearly 18, it may be reasonable to try antidepressants shown to work in studies of 18–64 years old but not in studies of 12–17 years old, such as mirtazapine (adrenergic alpha-2 auto receptors and heteroceptors antagonist and 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors blocker) or venlafaxine (serotonin and norepinephrine inhibitor); caution should be used with the latter due to possible increased risk of suicidal ideation, and for that reason it is especially important to seek peer advice. It may be worth trying an augmenting agent that has evidence in adults such as lamotrigine, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, or-thyroxine.

### Escitalopram (Lexapro) [^115dy71s]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with escitalopram treatment.

Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs.

While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.

Vital Sign Changes

Lexapro and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with Lexapro treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving Lexapro indicated that Lexapro treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.

Weight Changes

Patients treated with Lexapro in controlled trials did not differ from placebo-treated patients with regard to clinically important change in body weight.

Laboratory Changes

Lexapro and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with Lexapro treatment.

### Escitalopram therapy for major depression and anxiety disorders [^114dNRWi]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that escitalopram is efficacious in a range of mood and anxiety disorders, but the individual trials are insufficiently large to allow a full exploration of its tolerability.

Objective

To assess the tolerability and safety of escitalopram through analysis of all randomized controlled clinical trials in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.

Methods

Analyses of tolerability were based on data from all available randomized, double-blind, controlled studies completed by December 2006 in which escitalopram was compared with placebo or active compounds (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine). Adverse events (AEs) that occurred more frequently with escitalopram than with placebo were listed, and tolerability and safety were evaluated.

Results

Nausea was the only AE with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and 5 percentage points greater than with placebo during short-term treatment. In general, AEs were mild to moderate in severity. AEs related to sexual dysfunction were similarly frequent with escitalopram and citalopram, but were higher with paroxetine. No suicide occurred among escitalopram-treated patients, and there were no significant differences between escitalopram and placebo in incidence of suicidal behavior, measured by self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The 8 week withdrawal rate due to AEs was higher with escitalopram than with placebo (7.3% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001) but lower than with paroxetine (6.6% vs 9.0%; p < 0.01) or venlafaxine (6.1% vs 13.2%; p < 0.01) (Fisher's Exact test, 2 tailed). Compared with paroxetine, escitalopram resulted in significantly fewer discontinuation symptoms (average increase in Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale of 1.6 vs 3.9; p < 0.01). There were no clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory values in patients treated with escitalopram. Mean weight change after 6 months of treatment with escitalopram (0.58 ± 2.63 kg) was similar to that with placebo (0.15 ± 2.33 kg). The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar to that with placebo. The risk of AEs was no higher in special patient populations, such as the elderly (≥ 65 y of age) or those with hepatic dysfunction.

Conclusions

Based on data from randomized controlled trials involving more than 4000 escitalopram-treated patients, escitalopram (10–20 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated in short- and long-term treatment.

### Anxiety disorders: a review [^115bhSGJ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning.

Observations

Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.55 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.76 to -0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, -0.30 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39 [small to medium effect[[95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65]), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.

14.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules as a treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (75 to 225 mg per day), one 6-month, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study (75 to 225 mg per day), and one 6-month, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day) in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD.

In one 8-week study, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo for the 75, 150, and 225 mg per day doses as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. However, the 75 and 150 mg per day doses were not as consistently effective as the highest dose (study 1). A second 8-week study evaluating doses of 75 and 150 mg per day and placebo showed that both doses were more effective than placebo on some of these same outcomes; however, the 75 mg per day dose was more consistently effective than the 150 mg per day dose (study 2). A dose-response relationship for effectiveness in GAD was not clearly established in the 75 to 225 mg per day dose range studied.

Two 6-month studies, one evaluating venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules doses of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day (study 3) and the other evaluating venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules doses of 75 to 225 mg per day (study 4), showed that daily doses of 75 mg or higher were more effective than placebo on the HAM-A total, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the CGI scale during 6 months of treatment. While there was also evidence for superiority over placebo for the 37.5 mg per day dose, this dose was not as consistently effective as the higher doses.

Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of escitalopram and desmethylescitalopram in human milk (see Data). There are reports of excessive sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to escitalopram, through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of escitalopram or its metabolites on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for escitalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from escitalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to escitalopram should be monitored for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Data

A study of 8 nursing mothers on escitalopram with daily doses of 10 to 20 mg/day showed that exclusively breast-fed infants receive approximately 3.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of escitalopram and 1.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose of desmethylcitalopram.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution have been established in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) for the treatment of major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients with major depressive disorder has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution have not been established in pediatric (younger than 12 years of age) patients with major depressive disorder. In a 24-week, open-label safety study in 118 children (aged 7 to 11 years) who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram oral solution.

Safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram oral solution.

Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Venlafaxine

During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride were administered to 2897 patients in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. In addition, in premarketing assessment of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, multiple doses were administered to 705 patients in Phase 3 major depressive disorder studies and venlafaxine hydrochloride was administered to 96 patients. During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were also administered to 1381 patients in Phase 3 GAD studies and 277 patients in Phase 3 Social Anxiety Disorder studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in both development programs varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient (venlafaxine hydrochloride only) and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.

In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 5356 patients exposed to multiple doses of either formulation of venlafaxine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving venlafaxine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 2 and those events for which a drug cause was remote. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with venlafaxine, they were not necessarily caused by it.

### Efficacy of drug treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117SVCCb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To appraise the evidence for comparative efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments in patients with generalised anxiety disorder.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Primary Bayesian probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses allowed pharmacological treatments to be ranked for effectiveness for each outcome measure, given as percentage probability of being the most effective treatment. Secondary frequentist mixed treatment meta-analyses conducted with random effects model; effect size reported as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, Health Economic Evaluations Database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects via DataStar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library (January 1980 to February 2009). Eligibility criteria Double blind placebo controlled randomised controlled trials; published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Randomised controlled trials including adult participants (aged ≥ 18) receiving any pharmacological treatment for generalised anxiety disorder. Data abstraction methods Titles or abstracts reviewed initially, followed by review of full text publications for citations remaining after first pass. A three person team conducted screening; an independent reviewer checked a random selection (10%) of articles screened. Data extracted for meta-analysis were also independently reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of participants experiencing ≥ 50% reduction from baseline score on Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) (response), proportion with final HAM-A score ≤ 7 (remission), proportion withdrawing from trial because of adverse events (tolerability).

Results

The review identified 3249 citations, and 46 randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria; 27 trials contained sufficient or appropriate data for inclusion in the analysis. Analyses compared nine drugs (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, lorazepam, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline, tiagabine, and venlafaxine). In the primary probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses, fluoxetine was ranked first for response and remission (probability of 62.9% and 60.6%, respectively) and sertraline was ranked first for tolerability (49.3%). In a subanalysis ranking treatments for generalised anxiety disorder currently licensed in the United Kingdom, duloxetine was ranked first for response (third across all treatments; 2.7%), escitalopram was ranked first for remission (second across all treatments; 26.7%), and pregabalin was ranked first for tolerability (second across all treatments; 7.7%).

Conclusions

Though the frequentist analysis was inconclusive because of a high level of uncertainty in effect sizes (based on the relatively small number of comparative trials), the probabilistic analysis, which did not rely on significant outcomes, showed that fluoxetine (in terms of response and remission) and sertraline (in terms of tolerability) seem to have some advantages over other treatments. Among five UK licensed treatments, duloxetine, escitalopram, and pregabalin might offer some advantages over venlafaxine and paroxetine.

14.2 Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules as a treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder (also known as Social Phobia) was established in two double-blind, parallel group, 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder. Patients received doses in a range of 75 to 225 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). In these two trials, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the LSAS total score.

Examination of subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of age or race on outcome in these studies.

### Pharmacological treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116gFJxg]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder is a disease that can be associated with substantial dysfunction. Pharmacological treatment is often the first choice for clinicians because of the cost and resource constraints of psychological alternatives, but there is a paucity of comparative information for the multiple available drug choices.

Methods

A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomised trials in adult outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang data, Drugs@FDA and commercial pharmaceutical registries. Placebo and active control trials were included. Data were extracted from all manuscripts and reports. Primary outcomes were efficacy (mean difference [MD] in change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale Score) and acceptability (study discontinuations for any cause). We estimated summary mean treatment differences and odds ratios using network meta-analyses with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018087106.

Findings

Studies were published between Jan 1, 1994 and Aug 1, 2017, in which 1992 potential studies were screened for inclusion. This analysis is based on 89 trials, which included 25441 patients randomly assigned to 22 different active drugs or placebo. Duloxetine (MD -3·13, 95% credible interval [CrI] -4·13 to -2·13), pregabalin (MD -2·79, 95% CrI -3·69 to -1·91), venlafaxine (MD -2·69, 95% CrI -3·50 to -1·89), and escitalopram (MD -2·45, 95% CrI -3·27 to -1·63) were more efficacious than placebo with relatively good acceptability. Mirtazapine, sertraline, fluoxetine, buspirone, and agomelatine were also found to be efficacious and well tolerated but these findings were limited by small sample sizes. Quetiapine (MD -3·60 95% CrI -4·83 to -2·39) had the largest effect on HAM-A but it was poorly tolerated (odds ratio 1·44, 95% CrI 1·16–1·80) when compared with placebo. Likewise, paroxetine and benzodiazepines were effective but also poorly tolerated when compared with placebo. Risk of reporting bias was considered low, and when possible all completed studies were included to avoid publication bias.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest contemporary review of pharmacological agents for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder by use of network analysis. There are several effective treatment choices for generalised anxiety disorder across classes of medication. The failure of initial pharmacological therapy might not be a reason to abandon a pharmacological treatment strategy.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1	Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Effexor XR

7.2	Other Drug Interactions with Effexor XR

Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Drugs

The risk of using venlafaxine concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs (including alcohol) has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when Effexor XR is taken concomitantly in combination with other CNS-active drugs.

Weight Loss Agents

Concomitant use of Effexor XR and weight loss agents is not recommended. The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Effexor XR is not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.

Laboratory Test Interference

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.

GAD is a severe, chronic, and distressing illness that often requires long-term management. Considerable progress has been made in the ability to help these patients. New antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, and the SSRIs provide an important treatment alternative to "traditional" anxiollytic treatments, which include the benzodiazepines, buspirone, and the TCAs; however, comparative efficacy and the effects of psychiatric comorbidity, long-term treatment, and relapse prevention are areas requiring further investigation.

### Venlafaxine (venlafaxine hydrochloride) [^116hn1Vy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse reactions in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reaction incidence rate in the population studied.

Vital Sign Changes

Treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment for up to 12 weeks in premarketing placebo-controlled major depressive disorder trials was associated with a mean final on-therapy increase in pulse rate of approximately 2 beats per minute, compared with 1 beat per minute for placebo.

Treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for up to 12 weeks in premarketing placebo-controlled Social Anxiety Disorder trials was associated with a mean final on-therapy increase in pulse rate of approximately 4 beats per minute, compared with an increase of 1 beat per minute for placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3) for effects on blood pressure.]

In a flexible-dose study in MDD, with doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day, the mean pulse was increased by about 2 beats per minute compared with a decrease of about 1 beat per minute for placebo.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^111YY5cX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

In Europe, escitalopram is currently approved for use in major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to approval of escitalopram in 2002 for the treatment of MDD in the United States, the FDA conducted an extensive review of its clinical efficacy and tolerability data and concluded that escitalopram did not have notable efficacy or tolerability advantages over other marketed antidepressants. However, there have been many studies conducted since that time. This qualitative review of the literature sought to examine the more recent clinical literature and assess whether there is evidence of a clinical advantage for escitalopram over either citalopram or other frequently used antidepressants.

### Achieving remission with venlafaxine and fluoxetine in major depression: its relationship to anxiety symptoms [^116ZE389]. Depression and Anxiety (2002). Low credibility.

Venlafaxine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), produces significantly higher remission rates in depressed patients than do the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this analysis of pooled data, we explored the relationship between differences in treatment efficacy, early improvement of symptoms, and severity of baseline anxiety in depressed patients treated with either venlafaxine or fluoxetine. A pooled analysis was performed on data from 1,454 outpatients with major depression from five double-blind, randomized studies comparing the 6-week efficacy of venlafaxine (542 patients) with fluoxetine (555 patients). The Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) total and item scores were analyzed at different treatment times up to 6 weeks. Venlafaxine and fluoxetine both produced statistically significant higher response and remission rates compared with placebo starting from week 2 for response and weeks 3 to 4 for remission. Venlafaxine was statistically significantly superior to fluoxetine from week 3 until week 6 in respect of response rate, and from week 2 until week 6 for remission rate. After 1 week of treatment, greater improvement in individual symptoms was observed in the depressed mood, suicide, and psychic anxiety items of the HAM-D scale for both venlafaxine- and fluoxetine-treated patients compared with placebo. Improvement in psychic anxiety was statistically significantly greater with venlafaxine than with fluoxetine. The presence of baseline psychic anxiety correlated significantly to treatment outcome when analyzing the remission rates. In depressed patients with moderate anxiety (HAM-D psychic anxiety score ≤ 2), venlafaxine statistically significantly increased remission rates compared with placebo from week 4 until week 6, while a significant effect of fluoxetine on remission rates was observed starting at week 6. Remission rates in the severely anxious depressed patients (score > 2) were statistically significantly higher with venlafaxine than placebo starting from week 3 until the end of the study period, but no difference could be observed between fluoxetine and placebo. Baseline severity of psychic anxiety had a significant impact on remission rates after treatment of patients diagnosed with depression. Venlafaxine's superior remission rates in the more severely anxious patients and its ability to improve psychic anxiety as early as week 1 compared with fluoxetine suggest that venlafaxine's early efficacy on anxiety symptoms may be the basis for its superior efficacy in depression.

2. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions.

3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider.

Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.

Visual Problems. Only some people are at risk for these problems. You may want to undergo an eye examination to see if you are at risk and receive preventative treatment if you are.
Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.
Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.
Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1127mihJ]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Child/adolescent pharmacotherapy — scope of recommendations: While there is clear evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials for the use of fluoxetine (Prozac) in children and adolescents, there is limited evidence meeting the IOM or AMSTAR criteria for other antidepressants, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidepressant for youth, escitalopram (Lexapro). In the panel's review of the evidence for escitalopram, we were unable to recommend for or against this medication, and the panel has elected not to provide a recommendation on the use of Nefazodone (Serzone) as an antidepressant given its lack of clinical relevance for current practice. The panel concludes that the strongest evidence for a pharmacologic treatment for adolescent depression is for fluoxetine (Prozac), and if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.

### Venlafaxine effectively treats generalized anxiety disorder… [^113SySG7]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Many patients seek professional help that usually results in the use of medication to treat the symptoms. Many medications have been used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, but each has safety limitations or limited research indicating effectiveness. Venlafaxine affects the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways and may have some anxiolytic properties. Rickels and colleagues studied the safety and efficacy of extended-release venlafaxine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder without concomitant major depressive disorder. The study was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial using outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. To be included in the study, the patients had to score 18 or higher on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and score 2 or more on its anxious mood and tension factors. Patients were excluded if they had a concomitant major depressive disorder within six months of the study or a current diagnosis based on the screening interview.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or extended-release venlafaxine in a dosage of 75, 150 or 225 mg per day for up to eight weeks. Primary efficacy variables included total and psychic anxiety factor scores on the Hamilton anxiety scale, and severity and global improvement scores on the Clinical Global Impression scale at the end of the study. Safety evaluation was based on patients' reports of adverse events, routine physical examinations, laboratory evaluations and electrocardiography. Patients who received extended-released venlafaxine scored better on all four of the primary measurements when compared with the placebo group. In addition, they scored better on the Clinical Global Impression scale than those who received placebo. Patients responded well to three doses of venlafaxine, with the 225-mg-per-day dosage providing the best response.

The most common adverse events reported in the venlafaxine group included nausea, insomnia, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness and asthenia. These symptoms tended to be mild, to occur early in the treatment course and to subside with continued treatment. The authors conclude that extended-release venlafaxine is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in patients without concomitant major depressive disorder. All dosages of venlafaxine were effective, but 225 mg per day provided the best results. The majority of the side effects of the medication were mild and subsided with time.

### Escitalopram for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder… [^113PKWUq]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Participants treated with escitalopram showed greater improvement than with placebo in anxiety symptoms and role functioning and Stata version 9. We hypothesized that escitalopram would be better than placebo in achieving response, improving anxiety symptoms, and reducing anxiety-related impairments in function and quality of life. Figure 3 shows results from mixed-effects models of change in anxiety symptoms and role functioning. Escitalopram was significantly better than placebo for Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, activity limitations subscale, and role-emotional impairment and social function subscales.

No participants in either group had a serious or unexpected adverse event. One patient was hospitalized for bacterial endocarditis and was removed from the study after week 3. With respect to vital sign changes, we found a significant effect by treatment group on pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure, with a greater decrease in participants receiving escitalopram than those receiving placebo. In this clinical trial of SSRI treatment for GAD in older adults, we found that escitalopram was better than placebo in terms of cumulative response and improvements in anxiety symptoms and self-reported role functioning. Treatment with escitalopram was associated with a higher rate of several adverse effects, particularly fatigue or somnolence, vs placebo. In spite of this, adverse effects tended to be benign, not leading to serious events and rarely leading to dropout. Moreover, safety appeared favorable with respect to vital signs data.

Analyses of symptomatic change using mixed-effects models found escitalopram to be better than placebo. Additionally, because GAD is associated with impairments in role function similar to major depressive disorder or other common chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and arthritis, 3 we examined treatment-attributable changes in role functioning. The activity limitations and role-emotional impairment subscales, which measure impairments in role function, indicated that escitalopram was better than placebo.

### Efficacy of venlafaxine extended-release capsules in nondepressed outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder… [^116f2kT2]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.
. By an evaluable-patient analysis, venlafaxine XR compared with placebo significantly improved anxiety scores from week 1 or 2 through week 28 on all primary efficacy measures, including the HAM-A total, the HAM-A psychic anxiety factor, and the CGI scale scores. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to week 28 using last-observation-carried-forward. methods were for HAM-A, venlafaxine XR −13. 4, placebo −8. 7; for HAM-A psychic anxiety score, venlafaxine XR −7. 4, placebo −4. 2; and for CGI-Improvement, venlafaxine XR
2. 2, placebo 3.
0. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was nausea. venlafaxine XR group. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to week 28 using LOCF methods were: for HAM-A, venlafaxine XR −13. 4, placebo −8. 7; for HAM-A psychic anxiety score, venlafaxine XR −7. 4.

patients receiving venlafaxine XR and those receiving placebo were maintained through the final assessment of patients receiving therapy. Similar results were seen for the HAM-A psychic anxiety factor scores, in which patients treated with venlafaxine XR had significant reductions from baseline scores compared with patients treated with placebo. mean scores for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression anxiety subscale were significantly reduced in the venlafaxine XR group compared with the placebo group at both week 8 and week 28. Analysis of the Covi Anxiety Scale at weeks 8 and 28 showed similar results. Beginning. somatic factor, improved significantly as early as week 1 of the study, when patients were receiving venlafaxine XR at dosages of 75 mg/d. The significant anxiolytic response to venlafaxine XR was maintained during the entire 6 months of the study. Improvements in all primary and secondary.

placebo-controlled study demonstrated that pharmacologic therapy can produce long-term efficacy in treating outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD and has important implications for the pharmacologic management of GAD.
