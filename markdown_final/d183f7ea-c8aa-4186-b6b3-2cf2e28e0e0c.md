## Question

Copd exacerbation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about COPD exacerbation management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and its significance. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and differential. Next, I will assess severity and decide on the care setting. After that, I need to outline acute pharmacologic therapy, including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, and confirm durations and delivery details. I will then review ventilatory support indications and nuances. I should also consider special populations and comorbidities, followed by discharge planning and post-exacerbation prevention. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key controversies and evidence gaps, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its impact. COPD exacerbations are acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional therapy, with substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost; they accelerate lung function decline and worsen quality of life, and frequent exacerbators have higher risk of future events and mortality, so preventing and promptly treating them is central to COPD care [^1127tf1G] [^112ZyKnx] [^115JsdFV].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. Exacerbations are a clinical diagnosis of exclusion; I need to check for mimics such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, and pneumothorax, using chest radiography, ECG, and targeted labs as indicated, because misclassification delays appropriate therapy and worsens outcomes [^114QXA57] [^115y9TMN] [^115u8DQz].

> I should confirm severity stratification and the care setting next. Severe exacerbations are those requiring ED evaluation or hospitalization and may involve acute respiratory failure; indications for hospitalization include severe symptoms, hypoxemia, confusion, failure of outpatient therapy, serious comorbidities, or inadequate home support, and more than 80% of exacerbations are managed as outpatients when stable and safe [^111xYCbJ] [^111KHUFy] [^1121mfMb].

> Now, I will examine acute pharmacologic therapy, starting with bronchodilators. Short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting muscarinic antagonists, are first-line; I initially thought continuous nebulization might be superior, but wait, I should double-check — GOLD advises against continuous nebulization and supports MDI with spacer or nebulizer as equivalent, with air-driven nebulization preferred over oxygen-driven in hypercapnic patients to avoid worsening CO2 retention [^117KGC3t] [^1139DjP8].

> Next, I should review systemic corticosteroids. Prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days improves FEV1, oxygenation, and shortens recovery and hospitalization; oral therapy is as effective as IV, and I need to ensure I do not extend beyond 5 days given adverse effects; hold on, I should verify eosinophil-guided strategies — STARR2 showed noninferiority with reduced steroid exposure when eosinophils were low, supporting selective use in appropriate settings [^1111cf8t] [^115pVBZR].

> I will now examine antibiotics. I should confirm the classic indication: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence; antibiotics are also indicated when mechanical ventilation is required. Duration should be 5 days, and I need to remember that procalcitonin protocols remain unsupported in COPD exacerbations despite ongoing debate, so clinical judgment prevails [^115KNG56] [^116VjHs8] [^112Smz9Q].

> Let me consider ventilatory support carefully. Noninvasive ventilation is first-line for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure without absolute contraindications because it improves gas exchange, reduces intubation, shortens hospital stay, and improves survival; I should confirm that NIV is not indicated for isolated non-acidotic hypercapnia, and I must be ready to escalate to invasive ventilation if NIV fails or contraindications emerge, using an obstructive strategy with permissive hypercapnia when intubated [^116Zd5YK] [^115DGFBa] [^115apPsS] [^116nx1i2].

> But wait, what about special populations and comorbidities. In older adults, exacerbations carry higher mortality and readmission risk, so I should have a lower threshold for hospitalization and ensure early follow-up; cardiovascular disease is highly prevalent and drives poor outcomes, with markedly elevated risk of MI, stroke, and arrhythmias during and after exacerbations, so I need to screen and treat heart failure and ischemic heart disease per guidelines, including selective beta1-blockers for heart failure when indicated [^114mogju] [^115hrmeA] [^111DHGF6] [^114UbfqK].

> Next, I should review discharge planning and post-exacerbation prevention. Early follow-up within 30 days reduces readmissions and mortality, and I should arrange pulmonary rehabilitation within about 3 weeks of discharge when feasible; I need to ensure inhaler technique is verified, maintenance therapy is optimized, vaccinations are current, and a written action plan is in place, as these steps reduce future events and improve quality of life [^114yeBgS] [^1122Cfnq] [^1133UTyp] [^115rviYR].

> Hold on, I should verify the maintenance pharmacotherapy adjustments that reduce future risk. Escalating to LABA+LAMA improves symptoms and reduces exacerbations, and adding ICS is reasonable for frequent exacerbators, particularly with higher blood eosinophils; conversely, if there is no exacerbation history or eosinophils are low, I should consider de-escalation from ICS to minimize harm, always reassessing response after changes [^116wxaTc] [^117T38QG] [^111M1CDJ].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm. Outpatient mild cases get SABA ± SAMA, consider 5 days of prednisone if symptoms persist or worsen, and add antibiotics if the cardinal symptoms are present; inpatient moderate-to-severe cases get SABA ± SAMA, 5 days of systemic steroids, antibiotics when indicated, controlled oxygen titrated to SpO2 about 88–92%, and NIV for hypercapnic respiratory failure; throughout, I should address comorbidities, monitor closely, and plan early follow-up and rehabilitation [^1139DjP8] [^116SWGkW] [^115KNG56] [^116Zd5YK] [^114yeBgS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps. The field is moving toward phenotyping and precision medicine to tailor therapy, especially around eosinophil-guided steroid use and infection-specific treatments; telemonitoring has mixed results, and while care bundles are sensible, high-quality evidence for readmission reduction remains limited, so I need to individualize and document shared decision-making with patients [^112KBPsb] [^1125MwyU] [^117KTVoy].

> Finally, let me reconsider the core message to ensure internal consistency. Exacerbations are heterogeneous, high-risk events that demand rapid recognition, exclusion of mimics, severity-based care, guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy with attention to durations, judicious ventilatory support, proactive comorbidity management, and structured discharge with early follow-up and rehabilitation; adhering to these steps reduces morbidity, mortality, and costs while aligning with contemporary GOLD and ATS/ERS guidance [^1127tf1G] [^1139DjP8] [^116Zd5YK] [^1122Cfnq].

COPD exacerbations are acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional therapy [^1127tf1G], most often triggered by **respiratory infections** or environmental exposures [^1151AXqw]. They drive **higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs** [^112ZyKnx], and each event accelerates lung function decline and worsens quality of life [^112ZyKnx]. Management centers on **short-acting bronchodilators** [^1139DjP8], **systemic corticosteroids** [^115pVBZR], and **antibiotics** when indicated [^112Smz9Q], with **noninvasive ventilation** for acute respiratory failure [^116Zd5YK]. Prevention relies on **smoking cessation**, vaccination, optimized inhaled therapy, and **pulmonary rehabilitation** [^1122Cfnq]; early follow-up and self-management plans reduce recurrence and readmissions [^114yeBgS] [^115rviYR].

---

## Definition and clinical presentation

COPD exacerbations are defined by GOLD as an **acute worsening of respiratory symptoms** that results in additional therapy [^1127tf1G]. Typical features include:

- **Increased dyspnea**: Often with wheeze, chest tightness, and fatigue [^113VjNCk].
- **Cough and sputum**: Increased quantity and/or purulence [^116VjHs8].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, insomnia, or confusion in severe cases [^111KHUFy].

---

## Triggers and risk factors

Exacerbations are **heterogeneous events** with multiple triggers and risk factors:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza, RSV, rhinovirus) [^111FksNE] <br/> - Bacterial pathogens (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [^111FksNE] |
| Environmental | - Air pollution <br/> - Cold weather <br/> - Exposure to allergens or irritants [^112xFViT] |
| Patient-related factors | - Smoking <br/> - Comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, heart failure, diabetes) <br/> - Frequent exacerbations <br/> - Poor adherence to therapy <br/> - Advanced age [^112adMkD] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Exacerbations reflect **heightened airway inflammation**, increased mucus production, bronchoconstriction, and impaired gas exchange [^112xFViT]. These changes increase dyspnea, reduce exercise tolerance, and can precipitate respiratory failure [^111xYCbJ].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by history, examination, and targeted tests:

- **History**: Baseline COPD severity, prior exacerbations, comorbidities, medication adherence, and recent exposures [^115bpatp].
- **Examination**: Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, and mental status [^111KHUFy].
- **Laboratory tests**: Arterial blood gases (ABG), complete blood count, renal function, and electrolytes [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Chest radiography to exclude pneumonia, pneumothorax, or heart failure [^115y9TMN].

---

## Management strategies

### Pharmacological management

- **Bronchodilators**: Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) with or without short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) are first-line [^1139DjP8] [^117KGC3t].
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days improves lung function, oxygenation, and shortens recovery [^115pVBZR] [^1111cf8t].
- **Antibiotics**: Indicated for increased sputum purulence with dyspnea/volume or for ventilated patients; 5-day courses suffice [^112Smz9Q] [^115KNG56].
- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: First-line for acute respiratory failure without contraindications; reduces intubation and mortality [^116Zd5YK].

---

### Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological management includes **oxygen therapy** to maintain SpO2 at 88–92% to avoid hypercapnia [^notfound] and **pulmonary rehabilitation** initiated within 3 weeks post-discharge to improve recovery and reduce readmissions [^1122Cfnq] [^111aEzqt]. Supportive care with hydration, nutrition, and patient education are also essential [^115PLUcA].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **modifiable risks** and sustained disease control:

- **Smoking cessation**: Most effective intervention to reduce exacerbations and slow progression [^115pVopx].
- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines reduce infections and exacerbations [^notfound].
- **Optimized inhaled therapy**: LABA/LAMA ± ICS tailored to symptoms and exacerbation risk [^116wxaTc] [^117T38QG].
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Reduces exacerbations and improves quality of life [^1122Cfnq].
- **Self-management education**: Action plans and early symptom recognition reduce hospitalizations [^115rviYR].

---

## Prognosis and impact on quality of life

Exacerbations **accelerate lung function decline**, worsen symptoms, and reduce quality of life [^112ZyKnx]. Hospitalized exacerbations carry high short- and long-term mortality, with 5-year mortality around 50% and frequent readmissions [^114mogju] [^1125MwyU].

---

## Current research and emerging therapies

Research targets **precision medicine**, novel anti-inflammatory agents, and digital health tools. Biomarker-guided therapy (e.g. blood eosinophils) may refine steroid use [^1111cf8t], and telemedicine supports remote monitoring and early intervention [^1125MwyU].

---

COPD exacerbations are acute events with major clinical and economic impact; **timely, evidence-based management** and coordinated prevention are essential to improve outcomes and quality of life [^1127tf1G].

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a Primer for emergency physicians [^115PLUcA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) impose a significant burden on patients and the emergency health care system. Patients with COPD who present to the emergency department (ED) often have comorbidities that can complicate their management.

Objective

To discuss strategies for the management of acute exacerbations in the ED, from initial assessment through disposition, to enable effective patient care and minimize the risk of treatment failure and prevent hospital readmissions.

Discussion

Establishing a correct diagnosis early on is critical; therefore, initial evaluations should be aimed at differentiating COPD exacerbations from other life-threatening conditions. Disposition decisions are based on the intensity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities, severity of the disease, and response to therapy. Patients who are appropriate for discharge from the ED should be prescribed evidence-based treatments and smoking cessation to prevent disease progression. A patient-centric discharge care plan should include medication reconciliation; bedside "teach-back", wherein patients demonstrate proper inhaler usage; and prompt follow-up.

Conclusions

An effective assessment, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate discharge plan for patients with AECOPD could improve treatment outcomes, reduce hospitalization, and decrease unplanned repeat visits to the ED.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112CENvL]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### Goals of COPD treatment: focus on symptoms and exacerbations [^1151AXqw]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients' lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^117DMbKt]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Identifying acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using patient-reported symptoms and cough feature analysis [^115shvTT]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory condition worldwide and is increasing in prevalence. It is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms due to airflow and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. Patients with COPD are susceptible to acute worsening of their symptoms with additional therapy requirements — an episode known as an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).

COPD represents a major cause of health care utilization and expense, and healthcare costs rise with each instance of AECOPD a patient experiences. Within the primary care setting in the UK, the average total annual per-patient cost of COPD management, excluding medications, was £3396 for patients experiencing two or more moderate/severe exacerbations annually, the majority of this cost being attributable to the cost of primary care consultations. Similarly, a large study in the US, demonstrated a significant increase in all costs for patients with two or more exacerbations compared with the overall population of COPD patients, predominantly due to an increase in hospitalization. The early identification and prevention of AECOPD such that patients no longer require hospitalization represent a critical juncture in developing a cost-effective disease management strategy.

Rapid identification of AECOPD is imperative to ensure the timely initiation of appropriate and suitable treatment. It has been shown that early initiation of therapy for AECOPD reduces both exacerbation duration and the likelihood of hospitalization with an event. Delays in identifying AECOPD and thus delayed presentation to a hospital (≥ 24 h after symptom onset) result in a more than twofold increase in the odds of hospital admission. An incorrect diagnosis can also result in inappropriate treatment with a deterioration of symptoms before the alternative diagnosis is confirmed.

Current primary-care COPD action plans allow patients to self-manage and initiate therapy for exacerbations without initial medical input. This strategy depends on the patient being able to identify worsening symptoms correctly and for the symptoms to not be attributed to any co-morbidities such as asthma. A formal diagnosis of AECOPD typically requires radiology and may also require lung function tests and clinical assessment, although there are concomitant issues including inequity of access and cost. Alongside the momentum for patient-led care, is the increasing impetus toward incorporating remote-treatment technologies into primary care. This has been spurred on mainly by the reluctance of vulnerable patient populations, including those with pre-existing COPD, to present to healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease 2017 report. GOLD executive summary [^1129rUt1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This Executive Summary of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report focuses primarily on the revised and novel parts of the document. The most significant changes include: (1) the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been refined to separate the spirometric assessment from symptom evaluation. ABCD groups are now proposed to be derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbations; (2) for each of the groups A to D, escalation strategies for pharmacologic treatments are proposed; (3) the concept of deescalation of therapy is introduced in the treatment assessment scheme; (4) nonpharmacologic therapies are comprehensively presented; and (5) the importance of comorbid conditions in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reviewed.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations — the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

### Hospital management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111L23yG]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often complicated by episodes of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, which may lead to escalation of therapy and occasionally emergency department visits and hospitalization. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have a negative impact on quality of life and hasten the decline of lung function. They also significantly contribute to the direct and indirect healthcare costs of this disease. Severe exacerbations (those leading to hospital admission) have been associated with significant poor outcomes including an increased risk of readmissions and mortality. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of hospital readmission in the United States. In this review, we will provide a broad overview on the etiology, assessment, management, discharge planning, and follow-up care of patients hospitalized with AECOPD.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations on patients and payers [^115LQ9cp]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not only an established major cause of mortality and morbidity but is increasing in worldwide prevalence despite current medical interventions. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by periods of acute symptomatic, physiologic, and functional deterioration or exacerbations. These events are responsible for considerable additional morbidity and mortality and impact on patients' long-term health status. Despite advances in understanding disease mechanisms and in treatment, exacerbations continue to be the major cause of COPD-associated hospitalization, and provision for their management incurs considerable health care costs. Although pharmacologic therapies may improve clinical outcomes, these benefits must be optimized by prompt diagnosis and delivery. This will require improved understanding of this complex disease by physicians and patients alike.

The biology and importance of COPD exacerbations

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms but also often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. Exacerbations are caused by those insults that increase airway inflammation, principally episodes of bronchial infection, but also pollutants or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although it is generally true that exacerbations become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are large differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients, and patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype susceptible to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life and increased mortality. They are therefore a particularly important group to target for the exacerbation prevention strategies that are described below. There is emerging evidence to suggest that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events ranging from no more than troublesome increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, though some are considerably longer and a proportion of patients may never completely return to their pre-exacerbation baseline. Exacerbations in more severe disease commonly require hospitalisation, and they are a much more common cause of emergency hospital admission than, for example, exacerbations of asthma. Therefore, in addition to significant personal detriment to the patient, exacerbations of COPD demand a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, with an ageing population and relatively greater reductions in mortality from other prevalent diseases (notably cardiovascular disease) the burden of exacerbations continues to rise.

Hospitalization assessment and emergency department management in COPD exacerbations — potential indications for hospitalization assessment include severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, drowsiness; acute respiratory failure; onset of new physical signs (e.g., cyanosis, peripheral edema); failure of an exacerbation to respond to initial medical management; presence of serious comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias, etc.); and insufficient home support. When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation; if so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided, whereas in less severe cases the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation), and we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs.

End-of-life and hospice care in advanced COPD — trajectory, mortality and communication: In many patients, the disease trajectory in COPD is marked by a gradual decline in health status and increasing symptoms, punctuated by acute exacerbations that are associated with an increased risk of dying. Although mortality rates following hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD are declining, reported rates still vary from 23% to 80%. Progressive respiratory failure, cardiovascular diseases, malignancies and other diseases are the primary cause of death in people with COPD hospitalized for an exacerbation. Palliative care is a broad term that includes approaches to symptom control as well as management of terminal patients close to death. Palliative care, end-of-life care, and hospice care are important components of the care of patients with advanced COPD. End-of-life care should also include discussions with patients and their families about their views on resuscitation, advance directives and place of death preferences. At an individual level, prediction of 6-month survival in people with COPD is unreliable and therefore early discussion of these issues is important together with phased introduction of supportive care. Hospitalization may be a trigger to initiate discussion of advance care planning. Good advance care planning can reduce anxiety for patients and their families by talking about death and dying and offering emotional support. It can also ensure that care is consistent with their wishes and avoids unnecessary, unwanted and costly invasive approaches. For patients with very advanced or terminal illness, hospice services may provide additional benefit.

Management of exacerbations — ventilatory support and recovery course: Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival; exacerbation recovery time varies, taking up to 4–6 weeks to recover, with some patients failing to return to the pre-exacerbation functional state, and following an exacerbation appropriate measures for exacerbation prevention should be initiated.

Exacerbation risk in COPD: Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are episodes of acute respiratory symptom worsening often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation (see Chapter 4). ECOPD are key events in the natural history of the disease because they impact significantly on the health status of the patient (often for a prolonged period of time), enhance the rate of lung function decline, worsen the prognosis of the patient and are associated with most of the healthcare costs of COPD. ECOPD rates vary greatly between patients and during follow-up.

### Interventions to standardise hospital care at presentation, admission or discharge or to reduce unnecessary admissions or readmissions for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a scoping review [^117KTVoy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease that may be punctuated by episodes of worsening symptoms, called exacerbations. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are detrimental to clinical outcomes, reduce patient quality of life and often result in hospitalisation and cost for the health system. Improved diagnosis and management of COPD may reduce the incidence of hospitalisation and death among this population. This scoping review aims to identify improvement interventions designed to standardise the hospital care of patients with AECOPD at presentation, admission and discharge, and/or aim to reduce unnecessary admissions/readmissions.

Methods

The review followed a published protocol based on methodology set out by Arksey and O'Malley and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Electronic database searches for peer-reviewed primary evidence were conducted in Web of Science, EMBASE (Elsevier) and PubMed. Abstract, full-text screening and data extraction were completed independently by a panel of expert reviewers. Data on type of intervention, implementation supports and clinical outcomes were extracted. Findings were grouped by theme and are presented descriptively.

Results

21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Eight implemented a clinical intervention bundle at admission and/or discharge; six used a multidisciplinary care pathway; five used coordinated case management and two ran a health coaching intervention with patients.

Conclusion

The findings indicate that when executed reliably, improvement initiatives are associated with positive outcomes, such as reduction in length of stay, readmissions or use of health resources. Most of the studies reported an improvement in staff compliance with the initiatives and in the patient's understanding of their disease. Implementation supports varied and included quality improvement methodology, multidisciplinary team engagement, staff education and development of written or in-person delivery of patient information. Consideration of the implementation strategy and methods of support will be necessary to enhance the likelihood of success in any future intervention.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^112KBPsb]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with a significant mortality, health and economic burden. Their diagnosis, assessment and management remain suboptimal and unchanged for decades. Recent clinical and translational studies revealed that the significant heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of exacerbations could be resolved by grouping them etiologically. This is anticipated to lead to a better understanding of the biological processes that underlie each type of exacerbation and to allow the introduction of precision medicine interventions that could improve outcomes. This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations.

### Strategies to decrease exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can they impact disease progression? [^115aD3ag]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Preventing disease progression is a key element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. COPD exacerbations are adverse events that can result in a decline of lung function that can persevere. Therefore, reducing exacerbation frequency has the potential to affect disease progression and improve health status of COPD patients. This narrative review explores monitoring for disease progression in COPD and its potential association with COPD exacerbations.

Recent Findings

Pharmacotherapy can slow down disease progression, but the effect is mediated only in part by reducing exacerbations. While disease progression is continuous, patients with established airflow obstruction in early stages appear more vulnerable to faster declines in lung function. Longitudinal monitoring of lung function and structure is necessary to identify patients with disease progression.

Summary

Pharmacotherapy is an effective option for preventing disease progression. A holistic approach including longitudinal pulmonary function testing, clinical symptoms and imaging may be necessary to detect disease progression for early intervention.

Exacerbation diagnosis and treatment

Exacerbations of COPD remain a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and it is necessary to consider (and, where appropriate, rule out) other causes of increased breathlessness in patients with COPD presenting with symptom deteriorations. Conditions mimicking exacerbations include pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus and cardiac failure. Diagnosis of exacerbation therefore requires appropriate clinical assessment and may need further investigation with, for example, chest radiography.

The principles of exacerbation therapy have not changed greatly since the widespread introduction in the 1990s of non-invasive ventilation in preference to doxapram for the treatment of hypercapnoea at exacerbation of COPD. Therapies at exacerbation may be divided into those thought to have a disease-modifying effect, and those aiming to support respiratory function until disease-modifying therapies have had sufficient time to act.

Exacerbation therapy is administered stepwise according to the clinical severity of presentation, and a general scheme is presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that disentangling the concept of exacerbation severity from the severity of the underlying COPD is almost impossible: a patient needing intubation and ventilation at exacerbation may have milder disease with a greater acute deterioration, or more severe underlying disease and a trivial insult.

Figure 1
General scheme for management of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Therapy is added stepwise according to the severity of the presentation. Mild exacerbations may respond to an increase in the dose and/or frequency of inhaled bronchodilators alone. Exacerbations not responding to this require systemic corticosteroids, with the addition of antibiotics if there has been a change in the character of expectorated sputum. Additional interventions such as theophylline may be required where the clinical response is still incomplete. Oxygen and/or ventilatory support may be necessary at any stage in the presence of new or established respiratory failure. Exacerbation management should also include an assessment and management of comorbidities, and the opportunity should be taken to optimise long-term therapies to reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data and can be applied to any patient already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and when treatment modification, in particular de-escalation, is considered, patients should be under close medical supervision. The report notes that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested and that trials of de-escalation are limited and only include ICS. If response to initial treatment is appropriate, maintain it; if not, check adherence, inhaler technique and possible interfering comorbidities, evaluate whether dyspnea/activity limitation or prevention of exacerbations is the predominant treatable trait, use the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted, then select the corresponding algorithm and identify the box matching the current treatment to follow the suggested algorithm.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### Management of severe COPD [^115pVopx]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the burden of the disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention. Apart from smoking cessation, no approach or agent affects the rate of decline in lung function and progression of the disease. Especially in the later phase, COPD is a multicomponent disorder, and various integrated intervention strategies are needed as part of the optimum management programme. This seminar describes largely non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving health status and function of disabled patients. Exacerbations become progressively more troublesome as baseline lung function declines, commonly necessitating hospital admission and associated with the development of acute respiratory failure.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^111KzuaQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^111FksNE]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations, punctuating the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are associated with significant mortality as well as health and socioeconomic burden. They are the main drivers of the poor outcomes of COPD, which is consequently ranked as a leading cause of death and disability globally. It is estimated that every year 22%–40% of all patients with COPD experience at least one moderate or severe exacerbation, while 9%–16% experience more than one. As a result, exacerbations are responsible for one in eight emergency hospital admissions in the UK; an enormous number, considering that the 3-month mortality rate of a hospitalised exacerbation exceeds 15%. Patients experiencing frequent exacerbations have worse quality of life, accelerated lung function declineand are at increased risk of future exacerbations, myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular events and mortality.

With a definition, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies that remain insufficient and unchanged for decades, COPD exacerbations represent a major, unaddressed global health need. More specifically, their definition and diagnostic criteria are solely based on clinical characteristics, which lack specificity. The same symptoms are present in stable COPD or they can result from other respiratory or cardiac diseases. Therapeutically, exacerbations are approached as a single entity and treated uniformly with the administration of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids and commonly antibiotics. In reality, they are heterogeneous, characterised by diverging underlying mechanisms, outcomes and treatment needs. More specifically, only about 30%–50% of all exacerbations are associated with enhanced airway eosinophilic inflammation and appear to respond to systemic corticosteroids, whereas around 50% are triggered by bacterial infections and may respond to antibiotics. Finally, around 30% that are triggered by virusesare currently not treated etiologically, despite the availability of potentially beneficial treatments. Importantly, the heterogeneity of COPD extends beyond exacerbations. Therefore, subgroups of patients may be predisposed to specific subtypes of exacerbations, suggesting a potential role of precision medicine in exacerbations prevention.

This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations. A detailed description of the epidemiology, mechanisms, impact or outcomes of pneumonia, in patients with COPD, or of disease entities that could mimic COPD exacerbations was considered beyond the scope of this review.

Pulmonary rehabilitation after hospitalization for acute exacerbation of COPD — evidence on timing and outcomes indicates that a systematic review that included 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported reduced mortality and number of readmissions when rehabilitation was initiated during hospitalization or within 4 weeks of discharge, and while long-term effects on mortality were not statistically significant, improvements in health-related quality of life and exercise capacity appeared to be maintained for at least 12 months. Real-world evidence from a large population-based cohort of more than 190,000 patients hospitalized for COPD in the US found that initiation within 90 days of discharge, while rare, was significantly associated with lower risk of mortality and fewer rehospitalizations at one year. One study reported that initiating pulmonary rehabilitation before the patient's discharge may compromise survival through unknown mechanisms, and pulmonary rehabilitation ranks as one of the most cost-effective treatment strategies.

Initial assessment of COPD — The goals of the initial COPD assessment are to determine the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death), to guide therapy. Additional clinical assessment, including the measurement of lung volumes, diffusion capacity, exercise testing and/or lung imaging may be considered in COPD patients with persistent symptoms after initial treatment.

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^1146CtYK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society have jointly produced evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This educational article gives four perspectives on how these guidelines apply to the practical management of people with COPD. A current smoker with frequent exacerbations will benefit from support to quit, and from optimisation of his inhaled treatment. For a man with very severe COPD and multiple co-morbidities living in a remote community, tele-health care may enable provision of multidisciplinary care. A woman who is admitted for the third time in a year needs a structured assessment of her care with a view to stepping up pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment as required. The overlap between asthma and COPD challenges both diagnostic and management strategies for a lady smoker with a history of asthma since childhood. Common threads in all these cases are the importance of advising on smoking cessation, offering (and encouraging people to attend) pulmonary rehabilitation, and the importance of self-management, including an action plan supported by multidisciplinary teams.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^114KADo3]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up after therapy initiation — following implementation of therapy, patients should be reassessed for attainment of treatment goals and identification of any barriers for successful treatment; following review of the patient's response to treatment initiation, adjustments may be needed. This is guided by the principles of first review and assess, then adjust if necessary, including to review symptoms (dyspnea) and exacerbation risk (previous history, blood eosinophils), assess inhaler technique and adherence and the role of non-pharmacological approaches, and adjust pharmacological treatment including escalation or de-escalation; switching inhaler device or molecules within the same class may be considered as appropriate, and any change in treatment requires a subsequent review of the clinical response, including side effects.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up triage should help decide: i) whether to offer an in-person as opposed to a remote (telephone or virtual/online) consultation, and ii) who to prioritize. Remote follow-up could be considered when the patient or caregiver can understand the process and provide information clearly, when this is a regular COPD follow-up or the patient is followed for a known condition, when medical records and laboratory test results are accessible to the healthcare professionals, and when prescription and access to medication is possible and follow-up to the prescription can be arranged if necessary. In-person follow-up should be prioritized when the patient and caregiver have difficulty providing information, when the patient needs immediate attention due to the presence of severe medical symptoms, when changes in the patient's symptoms require a differential diagnosis work-up with the need for a physical exam and/or laboratory testing, or when patient treatment can only be given in person and cannot be given at home. Prioritization of in-person visits should take into consideration the COPD patient disease severity (symptom burden and risk of exacerbations), recent emergency department visit and/or hospital admission, associated significant comorbidities, age, and/or living alone at home.

### Research opportunities in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114jFyVs]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common problem in the emergency department. Despite considerable research involving the management of this disease over the past decade, much remains unclear from an emergency medicine perspective. Increased research would better guide the management of these complex patients from the perspectives of the patient, the caregiver, and society. The major areas of research can be divided into diagnosis, therapy, and education. The reliability and validity of different definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be assessed. The utility and performance characteristics of diagnostic testing need to be determined for this difficult patient population. Specific diagnostic tests include measures of dyspnea, spirometry and exercise tolerance, measures of gas exchange, airway inflammation, and chest imaging. It remains unclear which patient-specific therapies (oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and methylxanthines) should be used and monitored. Finally, the utility of education of both health care providers and patients and how it may be applied to the acute setting need to be addressed.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospital discharge and follow-up after an exacerbation — practice variability, risks, and interventions: Accordingly, there are no standards that can be applied to the timing and nature of discharge, and it is recognized that recurrent exacerbations leading to short-term readmission and increased all-cause mortality are associated with the initial hospitalization for an acute episode of deterioration; a systematic review has shown that comorbidities, previous exacerbations and hospitalization, and increased length of stay were significant risk factors for 30- and 90-day all-cause readmission after an index hospitalization with an exacerbation of COPD, and mortality relates to patient age, the presence of acidotic respiratory failure, the need for ventilatory support and comorbidities including anxiety and depression; care bundles at discharge that include education, optimization of medication, supervision and correction of inhaler technique, assessment and optimal management of comorbidities, early rehabilitation, telemonitoring and continued patient contact have all been investigated, but there is insufficient data that they influence either readmission rates or short-term mortality and there is little evidence of cost-effectiveness; one randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that telemonitoring did not change hospitalization or exacerbation rates in people with COPD, and nevertheless it remains good clinical practice to cover these issues before discharge and their effectiveness on health status and readmission rates may be increased if delivered with motivational interview-based health coaching.

### Practical management problems of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the elderly: acute exacerbations [^112adMkD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPDs) have numerous causes and are associated with increased mortality and hospitalization, especially in older patients. The urgent need to identify and enable timely treatment of ECOPDs is a necessity for physicians worldwide. This review will highlight the causes and optimal combinations of available treatments for such events in older populations.

Recent Findings

The exact definition of exacerbations is lacking; however, it is agreed that such events are considered episodes of worsening of symptoms, leading to morbidity and death. The aging process is a consistent determinant for ECOPD events and is associated with worsening of COPD stages. The incidence of ECOPD rises across the worsening stages of COPD. Studies have shown that the frequency of exacerbations increases with age and correlated clinical outcomes are poorer than in younger patients. The risk of mortality has also been shown to be significantly higher after a hospital admission following an acute exacerbation. At the moment, the need to rapidly and correctly treat acute exacerbations is crucially important in the rapidly growing elderly population.

Summary

ECOPDs are extremely dangerous events for older patients with severe stages of COPD. There is an urgent need to identify risk factors, identify tolerable treatment guidelines and manage acute exacerbations in older patients with COPD.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, chronic lung disease characterised by progressive and not fully reversible airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are defined by worsening in patients' baseline symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum (quantity and purulence); exacerbations become more frequent and severe as the disease progresses. These events constitute the single most important determinant of health status in patients with COPDand account for increased morbidity, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations and death.

A cornerstone of COPD management is preventing acute exacerbations of COPD and breaking the cycle of recurrence. A large body of evidence supports both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD and improve overall health status. Despite this evidence, important care gaps remain as patients are often discharged from hospital or the ED following an acute exacerbation of COPD with no clear plan to prevent future episodes. Information exchange between hospital, ED and primary care physicians about the acute exacerbation of COPD is often incomplete or unavailable at the first postdischarge outpatient appointment. Often, patients and families assume care coordination responsibilities and personally convey follow-up instructions to primary care physicians. Information is sometimes provided verbally, and patients often struggle with health literacy issues. This creates a critical situation in which inaccurate information is translated from acute to community care settings. There is a need to improve transitions of care for patients with COPD across ED, hospital and community settings and ensure coordination and continuity of care.

COPD as part of multi-morbidity should be recognized since an increasing number of people in any aging population will suffer from multi-morbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions, and COPD is present in most multi-morbid patients; multi-morbid patients have symptoms from multiple diseases and thus symptoms and signs are complex and most often attributable to several causes in the chronic state as well as during acute events; there is no evidence that COPD should be treated differently when part of multi-morbidity, but it should be kept in mind that most evidence comes from trials in people with COPD as the only significant disease; treatments should be kept simple in the light of the unbearable polypharmacy that these patients are often exposed to.

Anti-inflammatory agents in COPD — efficacy endpoints — prioritize exacerbation outcomes, as "exacerbations (e.g., exacerbation rate, patients with at least one exacerbation, time-to-first exacerbation) represent the main clinically relevant endpoint used for efficacy assessment of drugs with anti-inflammatory effects".

Acute exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are an important event in the life of a COPD patient as it causes significant deterioration of physical, mental, and social health, hastens disease progression, increases the risk of dying and causes a huge economic loss. Preventing ECOPD is therefore one of the most important goals in the management of COPD. Before the patient is discharged after hospitalization for ECOPD, it is crucial to offer an evidence-based care bundle protocol that will help minimize the future risk of readmissions and death. To develop the content of this quality care bundle, an Expert Working Group was formed, which performed a systematic review of literature, brainstormed, and debated on key clinical issues before arriving at a consensus strategy that could help physicians achieve this goal. A 7-point consensus strategy was prepared, which included: (1) enhancing awareness and seriousness of ECOPD, (2) identifying patients at risk for future exacerbations, (3) optimizing pharmacologic treatment of COPD, (4) identifying and treating comorbidities, (5) preventing bacterial and viral infections, (6) pulmonary rehabilitation, and (7) palliative care. Physicians may find this 7-point care bundle useful to minimize the risk of future exacerbations and reduce morbidity and mortality.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

Heart failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — prevalence and management: The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%, and its annual incidence is between 3–4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure and is recommended in patients with heart failure who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used, and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to support an alternative management strategy, and noninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart failure with acute pulmonary edema.

Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — risk periods, assessment, and treatment: Ischaemic heart disease should be considered in all COPD patients depending on their risk factor profile, and cardiovascular risk may be assessed by the global risk calculator, which can be found on the US National Heart Blood Lung Institute website and treatment initiated based on the current recommendations. During, and for at least 90 days after, acute COPD exacerbations there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of concomitant IHD, and hospitalization for an acute COPD exacerbation has been associated with 90-day mortality of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage; patients who demonstrate abnormal cardiac troponins in isolation are at increased risk of adverse outcomes including short-term (30-day) and long-term mortality. The treatment of ischaemic heart disease should be according to guidelines irrespective of the presence of COPD and vice versa.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — pharmacological treatment and bronchodilator delivery specify that the three classes of medications most commonly used are bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. For bronchodilators, it is recommended that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of a COPD exacerbation. A systematic review of the route of delivery of short-acting bronchodilators found no significant differences in FEV1 between using metered dose inhalers (MDI) (with or without a spacer device) or nebulizers to deliver the agent, although the latter may be an easier delivery method for sicker patients. It is recommended that patients do not receive continuous nebulization but use the MDI inhaler one or two puffs every one hour for two or three doses and then every 2–4 hours based on the patient's response. Although there are no clinical studies that have evaluated the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators with or without ICS during an exacerbation, we recommend continuing these treatments during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended to use in these patients due to significant side effects. If a nebulizer is chosen to deliver the bronchodilator agent, air-driven bronchodilator nebulization is preferable to oxygen-driven in acute exacerbations of COPD.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — antibiotic indications and duration: Antibiotics should be given to patients with exacerbations of COPD who meet cardinal symptom criteria or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). A metanalysis demonstrated that ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment had the same clinical and bacteriological efficacy as longer conventional treatment in outpatients, and We recommend a duration of ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment for outpatient treatment of COPD exacerbations. Based on conflicting data, we cannot recommend at this time the use of procalcitonin-based protocols to decide on antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The diagnosis of COPD involves a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, lung function tests (spirometry), and physical examination. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides guidelines for diagnosis and staging, which inform treatment decisions. According to GOLD criteria, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 is diagnostic for COPD. Managing COPD requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological interventions (such as steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics), pulmonary rehabilitation, and ventilator support. Stable COPD is characterized by a period of time when the patient's symptoms are stable and not experiencing an acute exacerbation. During this period, patients may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing, but these symptoms are typically manageable with medication and other treatments. Conversely, post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) patients are those who have recently experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD and are in the recovery phase. These patients are at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations, hospital readmissions, and mortality, and require careful management to prevent further decline and improve outcomes.

BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable respiratory disease characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms. Although misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis is common, it is estimated that worldwide prevalence of COPD has increased by 44.2% between 1990 and 2015, when the global prevalence was estimated to be 174.5 million individuals.COPD is currently the third-leading cause of death globally.

The clinical course of COPD is punctuated by episodes of acute worsening of symptoms. These acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) often require hospitalisation and are costly in terms of economics, lung healthand quality of life (QoL) for the patientwith heightened risk of readmission noted among patients with certain comorbidities and conditions, such as heart failure, renal failure, depression and alcohol use. Mortality rates of patients at 12 months postdischarge due to hospitalisation for AECOPD are over 20%. Huge variations in care have been noted within and between European countries with low adherence to clinical management recommendations. The need to reduce COPD exacerbations and hospitalisations has been recognised by guideline development bodies, researchers and clinicians, with international consensus guidelines calling for implementation of evidence-based approaches for improved COPD diagnosis and management.WHO '25 by 25 goal' aims to reduce global deaths from COPD by 25% by 2025.

The purpose of this review is to identify initiatives which aim to improve standardise hospital-based care of AECOPD patients at presentation, admission or discharge, and/or aim to reduce unnecessary AECOPD admissions/readmissions. These findings will assist in the design of a national AECOPD initiative which has been commissioned to standardise AECOPD acute, hospital-based care across Ireland.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a profound effect on the patient's health status and decline in lung function; they also impose a significant burden on healthcare resource utilization. Prevention and treatment of exacerbations is listed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as among the major objectives of COPD management, and it is therefore an important outcome measure when studying any new agent. This article discusses pharmacologic therapy and other measures for preventing exacerbations and hospitalizations due to exacerbations of COPD.

Acute exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) — cardiovascular risk during and after episodes increases significantly, likely related to worsening of systemic inflammation, abnormal pulmonary gas exchange, gas trapping and lung hyperinflation. Cardiovascular mechanisms that can influence lung function also worsen during ECOPD. As a result, during ECOPD the risk of acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and stroke increases further, particularly in severe episodes requiring hospitalization. The risk remains high during the first few weeks after hospital discharge, and it can still remain significantly increased even one year after discharge.

Implications of Strong and Conditional Recommendations: From the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — management of patients currently on long-acting beta2-agonist plus inhaled corticosteroid (LABA+ICS): If there is an indication for ICS use then LABA+LAMA+ICS has been shown to be superior to LABA+ICS, and for patients on LABA+ICS it is important to review prior exacerbation history and previous positive response to ICS. If there was no relevant exacerbation history, then consider changing to LABA+LAMA; if there was a previous exacerbation history but currently there are no exacerbations this suggests a positive response to treatment, and if dyspnea persists despite treatment with LABA+ICS, escalation to LABA+LAMA+ICS should be considered. If the patient is currently suffering with exacerbations, blood eosinophil counts can guide treatment: if < 100 cells/μl then consider changing to LABA+LAMA, while ≥ 100 cells/μl suggests that LABA+LAMA+ICS should be used. The benefits and risks of ICS withdrawal should be carefully considered, with a blood eosinophil count > 300 cells/μl being an indicator of increased risk of exacerbations with ICS withdrawal.

Oral glucocorticoids — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), oral glucocorticoids have numerous side effects, including steroid myopathy which can contribute to muscle weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in people with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or during emergency department visits have been shown to reduce the rate of treatment failure, the rate of relapse and to improve lung function and breathlessness, whereas prospective studies on the long-term effects in stable COPD are limited. Therefore, while they play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

COPD exacerbations — systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

Evolving COPD guidelines

2011 saw a substantial revision of the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD, which has recently been updated. Recommendations for treatment are no longer based primarily on categorization ("staging") by spirometric assessment, but on categorization by existing symptoms (using validated modified Medical Research Council and COPD Assessment Test questionnaires) and risk (based on severity of airflow limitation and history of exacerbations). This approach acknowledges the importance of consideration of both short- and long-term outcomes when making treatment decisions (Figure 1).

### COPD advanced patient management [^113tFEss]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, with current rates of both morbidity and mortality persisting and contributing significantly to long-term disability. More than 11 million Americans are diagnosed with COPD, with an additional 13 million people estimated to be living with undiagnosed disease. For patients diagnosed with COPD, the turning point will be hospitalization. It is important, therefore, that new treatment techniques that manage the signs and symptoms of the COPD and impact the prevalence and severity of exacerbations, hospital admissions, quality of life, and activities of daily living, and innovative clinical management strategies that optimize hospital discharge planning, all show promise in improving outcomes for patients with COPD. In particular, readmissions following COPD hospitalization are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and costs of care, and therefore hospital readmissions are receiving close scrutiny as an opportunity to improve patient care. To this end, programs to assess the presence and severity of dyspnea, and secretion burden and clearance, through implementation of a telemedicine program, use of noninvasive ventilation or supplemental oxygen, and development of a comprehensive self-management program have all been found to be variously effective as elements of a posthospitalization treatment plan. In this series of multi-media presentations and roundtable discussions published in CHEST (available at http://journal.cme.chestnet.org/copd-advanced-patient), leading international faculties discuss some of these specific interventions in detail to provide clinicians with possible solutions to the challenges of managing their patients with advanced COPD.

Ventilatory support in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) notes that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is occasionally used in patients with stable very severe COPD, and NIV may be considered of some use in a selected group of patients, particularly in those with pronounced daytime hypercapnia and recent hospitalization, although a systematic review was unable to support or refute this; in contrast, in patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear indications for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). During exacerbations of COPD, NIV in the form of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is the standard of care for decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD and acute respiratory failure, and in stable patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear benefits associated with the use of CPAP to improve both survival and the risk of hospital admissions.

### Evaluation and management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in the emergency department [^116nx1i2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Obstructive lung disease includes asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exacerbation of asthma or COPD can result in significant morbidity and mortality, and emergency department (ED) care is often required. ED evaluation should assess risk factors for severe exacerbation and the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status. Assessments including chest radiograph, point-of-care ultrasound, capnography, and electrocardiogram can assist. First-line treatments for acute exacerbation include bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Noninvasive ventilation, magnesium, ketamine, and epinephrine should be considered in those with severe exacerbation. Mechanical ventilation is challenging and should use an obstructive lung strategy with permissive hypercapnia.

The guideline, Pharmacologic Management of COPD Exacerbations, was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and approved by the Board of Directors in April 2021. The guideline was then published in the American Family Physician. The guideline panel also noted that short-acting bronchodilators are routinely used to improve symptoms in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Key Points for Practice
- Systemic corticosteroids prevent clinical failure in COPD exacerbations. Treatment for 10 days or longer increases adverse effects and may not be more effective than treatment for three to five days.
- Antibiotics for seven days increase clinical cure in COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 7.
- Magnesium, theophyllines, and mucolytics do not improve outcomes in COPD exacerbations, and bronchodilators had no benefit in limited studies. From the AFP Editors. Approximately 15 million Americans are affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with airflow limitations, cough, and shortness of breath. Chronic respiratory diseases, including COPD, are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Acute exacerbations of COPD increase mortality and hospital admissions while reducing lung function and quality of life. Despite this risk, evidence is limited for treating exacerbations.

The American Academy of Family Physicians has published guidelines for treating acute exacerbations of COPD based on a systematic review. Antibiotic Therapy Antibiotic therapy also improves outcomes in acute exacerbations of COPD. Moderate quality evidence suggests that antibiotic treatment increases the rate of clinical cure at the end of treatment with an NNT of 7 and reduces the rate of clinical failure with an NNT of 9. Evidence is insufficient to suggest the superiority of any one antibiotic. Antibiotics used in trials included doxycycline, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Antibiotics were most often administered for seven days. Nonpharmacologic Treatments Chest physiotherapy was not found to improve outcomes in COPD exacerbations, but a small study of whole-body vibration showed improvements in quality of life. Small trials of aerobic training and resistance training suggest a slight improvement in dyspnea.

One trial of oxygen therapy in acute COPD exacerbations found lower mortality when oxygen is titrated to a target oxygen saturation instead of using high-flow oxygen for all patients. All agree on the usefulness of corticosteroid therapy in exacerbations and cast doubt on magnesium and mucolytics. Although all agree that antibiotics appear to reduce treatment failure, the VA/DoD are ambivalent about their use because antibiotics have not been shown to reduce recurrent exacerbations. The GOLD and AHRQ reports support the AAFP recommendation for antibiotic use. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.
