## Question

How often should a patient with heart failure get an echocardiogram?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often a patient with heart failure should get an echocardiogram. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial diagnostic echocardiogram and when it should be obtained. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines say about routine repeat echocardiography in stable chronic HF. Next, I will consider scenarios that justify repeat imaging, including clinical change, device or procedural decisions, and special populations like LVADs, cardio-oncology, and inherited cardiomyopathies. After that, I should review acute HF and inpatient contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded cadence and double-check for any exceptions or controversies before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment principle: in suspected or newly diagnosed HF, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the preferred initial imaging modality to define structure, function, and etiology, and this should be obtained promptly as part of the diagnostic workup, typically within weeks of presentation depending on acuity and biomarker levels, with urgent imaging for hemodynamic instability or acute decompensation [^114d2Vns] [^111LxGdF] [^1169SWwA].

> Wait, let me verify the stance on routine repeat imaging in stable chronic HF without clinical change. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline explicitly states that routine repeat assessment of LV function in the absence of clinical status change, treatment interventions likely to affect function, or candidacy for device therapy is not indicated, and this aligns with earlier ACC/AHA guidance discouraging routine periodic EF checks at fixed intervals when nothing has changed clinically [^111LxGdF] [^114QjfyF] [^115r9BP9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should define what constitutes a "significant clinical change" that would justify repeat TTE. Triggers include new or worsening dyspnea/edema, decompensated HF requiring hospitalization or IV diuretics, suspected ischemia or new arrhythmia, or a major intercurrent illness. In these settings, repeat TTE is appropriate to reassess EF, remodeling, and valvular status to guide management decisions [^111LxGdF] [^115DsUrB].

> I need to check the scenario of therapy optimization and device candidacy. After initiation or uptitration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), or when considering ICD/CRT, mechanical circulatory support, or transplant, repeat TTE is useful to document response and inform candidacy; similarly, in HF with improved EF (HFimpEF), continued surveillance is reasonable given relapse risk if therapy is withdrawn, even though the optimal interval is individualized [^111LxGdF] [^111WjA23].

> Let me consider special populations where surveillance is standard. For LVAD patients, surveillance TTE is recommended at approximately 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-implant, then every 6–12 months, with problem-focused or speed-change studies as clinically indicated. This cadence is distinct from routine HF care and reflects device-specific complications and optimization needs [^1137bvtv] [^113QUaSz].

> I should confirm the cardio-oncology context. During potentially cardiotoxic therapy such as anthracyclines or trastuzumab, periodic TTE monitoring is commonly advised, historically every 3 months during trastuzumab per FDA labeling, though this frequency is debated; after therapy completion, a TTE at 3–12 months is reasonable, with longer-term intervals individualized by risk, cumulative dose, and prior cardiotoxicity, acknowledging evolving evidence and calls for personalized surveillance [^111vpnDo] [^11791cix].

> But wait, what if there is a suspected inherited cardiomyopathy. In families with known pathogenic variants or phenotype, first-degree relatives should undergo periodic screening with ECG and echocardiography, typically every 3–5 years in adulthood, with closer intervals in adolescence and when new symptoms arise; this is a distinct indication separate from routine HF follow-up [^117VX5Vv].

> Next, I should review acute HF and inpatient care. In acute decompensated HF, TTE is indicated during the index admission to establish or refine diagnosis, assess hemodynamics, and identify reversible causes; in hemodynamically unstable patients, bedside focused echo can be performed rapidly, but comprehensive TTE should follow when feasible to guide inpatient management and discharge planning [^1169SWwA] [^112AccUM].

> Let me synthesize a practical cadence and double-check it against guidelines. For stable chronic HF without clinical change, no routine repeat TTE is needed. Reassess when there is a significant change in symptoms or signs, after major therapy changes that could remodel the ventricle, or when device or procedural decisions are pending. If EF has improved into the HFimpEF range, periodic TTE every 6–12 months is reasonable to ensure stability. For LVAD patients, follow the device-specific surveillance schedule. For cardio-oncology, tailor to risk and treatment phase. For inherited cardiomyopathy screening, use periodic family surveillance rather than HF follow-up intervals [^111LxGdF] [^1137bvtv] [^111vpnDo] [^114gwq4j].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a mandated annual TTE for all HF patients, but I should correct that. There is no guideline-supported requirement for routine annual echocardiography in stable HF without clinical change, and repeating TTE in that context is rated as inappropriate in appropriateness frameworks, reinforcing a change-in-status–driven approach rather than calendar-based repetition [^111LxGdF] [^111Lu3xu].

> I will now examine alternatives when TTE is inadequate. If image quality is poor or windows are limited, cardiac MRI is recommended to accurately assess volumes, mass, and EF; CMR or other advanced imaging can also clarify etiology such as infiltrative disease or scar, and should be considered when echo cannot answer the clinical question [^114SsdX2] [^113qVSzG] [^1175JYp5].

> Let me reconsider and ensure I have not missed any nuance. The overarching principle is that repeat TTE should be driven by clinical need, not the calendar; use it to answer a specific question raised by symptoms, therapy, devices, or family screening, and avoid routine periodic imaging in stable patients without a management-changing indication, which aligns with contemporary guideline-based care and stewardship principles [^111LxGdF] [^114QjfyF].

Echocardiography is indicated at **initial diagnosis** of heart failure to define cardiac structure, function, and etiology [^113fTEPL] [^111LxGdF]. For stable patients without clinical change, **repeat echocardiography is not routinely recommended**; it should be reserved for significant clinical changes, new symptoms, or major treatment changes that could alter cardiac function [^111LxGdF] [^114QjfyF]. For patients on cardiotoxic chemotherapy, echocardiography every 3–6 months during treatment is reasonable, with individualized surveillance thereafter [^111vpnDo]. In LVAD patients, routine surveillance echocardiography is recommended at 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, then every 6–12 months [^1137bvtv]. For HFpEF, periodic echocardiography may be considered to assess diastolic function and structural changes, but routine repeat imaging without clinical change is not advised [^111LxGdF].

---

## Initial echocardiographic evaluation

Echocardiography is essential at **initial diagnosis** to characterize cardiac structure and function, quantify ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, assess valvular disease, and identify ischemic or non-ischemic etiologies [^113fTEPL] [^111LxGdF]. It is the preferred initial imaging modality for suspected or newly diagnosed heart failure [^113fTEPL] [^111LxGdF].

---

## Routine follow-up echocardiography in stable patients

Routine periodic echocardiography in stable patients without clinical change is **not recommended** [^111LxGdF]. Repeat imaging is appropriate only when there is a significant change in clinical status, new symptoms, or major treatment modifications that could affect cardiac function [^111LxGdF] [^115r9BP9].

---

## Indications for repeat echocardiography

Repeat echocardiography is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Significant clinical change**: New or worsening symptoms, functional decline, or clinical deterioration [^111LxGdF] [^115DsUrB].

- **Major treatment changes**: Initiation or significant adjustment of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), device implantation (ICD, CRT), or mechanical circulatory support [^111LxGdF] [^1137bvtv].

- **Device therapy**: Patients with ICDs, CRT, or LVADs may require periodic echocardiography to assess device function and cardiac response [^1137bvtv] [^113QUaSz].

- **Chemotherapy**: Patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy may benefit from periodic echocardiography to monitor for cardiotoxicity [^111vpnDo].

## Frequency of echocardiography in specific clinical scenarios

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis of HF | Immediate echocardiography [^113fTEPL] [^111LxGdF] |
| Stable HF without clinical change | No routine repeat echocardiography [^111LxGdF] [^114QjfyF] |
| Significant clinical change or new symptoms | Repeat echocardiography as indicated [^111LxGdF] [^115DsUrB] |
| Major treatment changes (GDMT, device therapy) | Repeat echocardiography as indicated [^111LxGdF] [^115DsUrB] |
| Cardiotoxic chemotherapy | Every 3–6 months during treatment [^notfound] |
| LVAD patients | - 2 weeks <br/> - 1 month <br/> - 3 months <br/> - 6 months <br/> - 12 months <br/> - Then every 6–12 months [^1137bvtv] |
| HFpEF (stable) | No routine repeat echocardiography [^111LxGdF] |

## Echocardiography in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

In HFpEF, echocardiography is essential for diagnosing diastolic dysfunction and structural abnormalities (e.g. left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy) [^112bv1BM]. Routine periodic echocardiography in stable HFpEF patients without clinical change is **not recommended**; repeat imaging is guided by clinical status and symptoms [^111LxGdF].

---

## Role of echocardiography in acute heart failure

In acute heart failure, echocardiography is critical for rapid diagnosis, hemodynamic assessment, and guiding initial management [^1169SWwA]. It helps differentiate cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic causes of dyspnea, assesses ventricular function, and identifies complications such as pericardial effusion or valvular emergencies [^112AccUM].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Echocardiography has limitations, including operator dependence, variability in image quality, and limited utility in certain clinical scenarios (e.g. severe obesity, lung disease) [^116CSUZN] [^115ijAew]. Alternative imaging modalities, such as cardiac MRI or CT, may be necessary when echocardiography is inadequate or inconclusive [^113qVSzG] [^114SsdX2].

---

Echocardiography is indicated at **initial diagnosis** of heart failure and should be repeated only when clinically indicated by changes in symptoms, treatment, or device therapy. Routine periodic echocardiography in stable patients without clinical change is not recommended [^111LxGdF].

### Diagnostic tests… [^114ZLhxb]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Physical Examination A complete physical examination is the second component in the diagnosis of heart failure. The patient's general appearance should be assessed for evidence of resting dyspnea, cyanosis and cachexia. While the maneuver is maintained, a decrease in the blood pressure occurs with loss of Korotkoff's sounds. Release of the maneuver is followed by an overshoot of blood pressure and the reappearance of heart sounds. Abnormal responses occurring in patients with heart failure are maintenance of beats throughout Valsalva's maneuver or lack of reappearance of Korotkoff's sounds after release of the maneuver. 22 Diagnostic Tests ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY An electrocardiogram should be obtained in all patients who present with heart failure. No specific ECG feature is indicative of heart failure, but atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common findings.

For example, atrial fibrillation is present in 25 percent of patients with cardiomyopathy, especially elderly patients with advanced heart failure. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler flow studies is highly recommended for all patients with heart failure. 25 This test helps in the assessment of left ventricular size, mass and function. Transesophageal echocardiography offers higher quality images than transthoracic studies. However, this technique is invasive and is best reserved for use when the quality of the two-dimensional echocardiogram is unacceptable. Findings suggestive of diastolic dysfunction on the two-dimensional echocardiogram are left ventricular hypertrophy, a dilated left atrium, a normal or nearly normal ejection fraction and reversal of the normal pattern of flow velocity across the mitral valve.

3 gallop on the physical examination, the presence of Q waves on the ECG and the finding of cardiomegaly on the chest radiograph. In contrast, diastolic dysfunction is suggested by a history of hypertension and older patient age, a sustained point of maximal impulse and an S 4 gallop on the physical examination, left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG and a normal-sized heart on the chest radiograph. 36 However, the findings can overlap considerably, and echocardiography of the heart is usually necessary.

HFpEF prediction scores — For patients with an uncertain probability of HFpEF, the H2FPEF score is a weighted score ranging from 0 to 9 based on six clinical variables (heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, PH, older, and filling pressure) with weights of 2 points, 1 point, 3 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 1 point, respectively. A score of 0 to 2 indicates a low probability of HFpEF, an intermediate score of 2 to 5 is correlated with a 40% to 80% likelihood of HFpEF, and a score > 5 indicates high HFpEF probability. The HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm is a stepwise approach to the diagnosis of HFpEF that must be performed in the ambulatory setting; it begins with a pretest probability assessment including electrocardiography, echocardiography, NP levels, and functional testing such as the 6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and if a diagnosis of HFpEF is intermediate, noninvasive or invasive exercise stress testing is recommended.

Echocardiography is well qualified to meet the growing need for noninvasive imaging in the expanding heart failure (HF) population. The recently-released American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HF labeled echocardiography "the single most useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with HF… ", because of its ability to accurately and noninvasively provide measures of ventricular function and assess causes of structural heart disease. It can also detect and define the hemodynamic and morphologic changes in HF over time and might be equivalent to invasive measures in guiding therapy. In this article we will discuss: 1) the clinical uses of echocardiography in HF and their prognostic value; 2) the use of echocardiography to guide treatment in HF patients; and 3) promising future techniques for echocardiographic-based imaging in HF. In addition, we will highlight some of the limitations of echocardiography.

### Heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction [^117DcumS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

It is estimated that approximately 50% of the heart failure population has a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, a complex broadly referred to as heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (HFNEF). While these patients have been considered in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials to represent a single pool of patients, limited more detailed studies indicate that HFNEF patients are a very heterogeneous group, with a number of key pathophysiologic mechanisms. This review summarizes and critically analyzes available data on the pathophysiology of HFNEF, placing it into context with a recently developed diagnostic algorithm. We evaluate the utility of commonly applied echocardiographic measures and biomarkers and integrate mechanistic observations into potential future therapeutic directions.

Family history and screening in suspected inherited cardiomyopathy — scope and yield: In patients in whom a genetic or inherited cardiomyopathy is suspected, a family history should be performed, including at least 3 generations and ideally diagrammed as a family tree pedigree; phenotype and family history are important for identifying patients in whom genetic testing is most likely to yield clinically actionable information, and genetic variants have been implicated in 25% to 40% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a positive family history but also in 10% to 30% of patients without a recognized family history; unless shown to be free of the genetic variant(s) implicated in the proband, first-degree relatives of affected probands should undergo periodic screening with echocardiography and electrocardiography.

### Echocardiography in acute heart failure: current perspectives [^115NpjxT]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

In contrast to chronic heart failure (HF), the use of echocardiography in acute HF (AHF) is less well defined, both in clinical practice and in clinical trials. Current guidelines recommend the utility of echocardiography as an adjunct diagnostic tool in the clinical setting of new-onset or decompensated HF. However, despite its unique advantages as the only practical imaging modality in AHF, echocardiography poses unique challenges in this setting. Data from early-phase clinical studies and trials provide evidence that echocardiographic end points can be clinically meaningful surrogate end points as a means to track response to treatment in AHF; however, the optimal timing and selection of echocardiographic measures is under active investigation. In addition, despite a number of studies indicating that certain echocardiographic measures of cardiac function are predictive of post-discharge prognosis, the role of echocardiography as a tool for patient classification and risk determination in AHF is less well defined. Importantly, it is unclear whether echocardiography can be used to phenotype and select AHF patients for interventions. In this article, we (1) appraise the current evidence for use of echocardiographic measures in AHF, (2) identify knowledge gaps regarding optimal use of echocardiography in AHF, and (3) assess the evidence for echocardiography as a prognosis determination and risk stratification tool in AHF.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^116JPvGy]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome in which signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF) occur despite a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line imaging modality but disparities in patient pathways across the UK can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to develop and validate a consistent, clinically appropriate and practical approach for reporting the echocardiographic suspicion of HFpEF.

Methods

Using the Delphi method, a steering group of nine UK experts identified key domains for discussion and generated consensus statements relevant to the echocardiographic detection of HFpEF. Using a four-point Likert scale, a survey including all statements was disseminated among a wider audience of healthcare professionals to determine agreement. A consensus threshold of 75% agreement was defined as 'strong' and ≥ 90% as 'very strong'.

Results

A total of 34 consensus statements were generated in seven domains: (1) challenges in the system approach to HFpEF; (2) enhancing referral for specialist review including echocardiography; (3) confidence in using a summary statement in an echo report; (4) identifying HFpEF and its underlying aetiology; (5) HF awareness, training and education; (6) refining multidisciplinary team roles in decision-making; (7) optimising patient experience.

135 UK specialists experienced in managing HF participated in the survey, including physiologists/clinical scientists (n = 43), HF specialist nurses (n = 35), cardiologists (n = 34), general practitioners (n = 12), pharmacists (n = 4) and others (n = 7). 20 of 34 (59%) statements achieved very strong agreement, 10 of 34 (29%) achieved strong agreement and 4 of 34 (12%) did not meet the consensus threshold.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of HFpEF requires access to essential diagnostic tools. Establishing standardised pathways for specialist assessment and referral, including TTE reporting of HFpEF, may help eliminate diagnostic delays and geographical disparities. Further education and awareness are crucial for improving detection rates, prompt referral and patient experience.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^115ozoFe]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3.4 Recommendation 4

Determine whether echocardiography is indicated or not. If indicated, determine what level of echocardiography is appropriate for the clinical question (Figure 3).

1.3.4.1 Background to Recommendation 4

Triage requires collaboration between the clinician and echocardiographer. The decision is based on:
The likelihood of disease (e.g. lower in asymptomatic young patient with murmur).
Symptoms.
The results of previous studies.
The clinical question.

1.3.4.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Asymptomatic murmur. These can be assigned to a murmur clinic or a general outpatient basic/level 1 echocardiography session.

1.3.4.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

The cardiologist has a specific clinical question that can be answered by a focussed scan usually in the context of a specialist valve clinic where the clinical assessment and echocardiogram are done at the same time. These are therefore unlikely to appear on a general outpatient list:
In an asymptomatic patient to look for thickening of a biological aortic valve replacement.
In a patient with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis or moderate or severe mitral regurgitation to detect a fall in LV ejection fraction or a rise in the peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation.
Previous mild HVD to detect progression requiring a minimum standard study.

1.3.4.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Previous studies show significant HVD, and the request is at a guideline‐compliant frequency or otherwise clinically justified.

1.3.4.1.4 Examples of Studies Not Indicated are

Repeat studies for any HVD earlier than recommended by guidelines in the absence of a clinical change.
Repeat studies for normally functioning biological valves (without any clinical symptoms/signs to suggest failure) before guideline indications.
Repeat study for most patients with mild native valve regurgitation and for studies previously shown to be normal.
Repeat studies in the absence of symptoms/signs, for patients who received TAVI, who would not be suitable for re‐intervention.

### Echocardiography in the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1137bvtv]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

LVAD surveillance echocardiography — LVAD surveillance echocardiography is performed at the pump's baseline speed with LVAD-specific views and Doppler flow assessments in addition to a standard heart failure (HF) TTE exam, and addition of an LVAD optimization protocol may involve imaging at pump speeds higher and/or lower than baseline; the authors recommend follow-up surveillance TTE for patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course (including successful weaning from IV agents within 14 days) and state that periodic LVAD surveillance echo exams are recommended, with an exam that should be considered at approximately 2 weeks after implantation or before index discharge, followed by consideration of surveillance TTE at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually every 6 to 12 months thereafter.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111LxGdF]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — evaluation with cardiac imaging states that in patients with suspected or new-onset heart failure (HF) or acute decompensated HF, a chest x-ray should be performed to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, and alternative causes, and in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed HF, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed during initial evaluation to assess cardiac structure and function. In patients with HF who have had a significant clinical change or who have received guideline-directed medical therapy and are being considered for invasive procedures or device therapy, repeat measurement of ejection fraction (EF), degree of structural remodeling, and valvular function are useful to inform therapeutic interventions. If echocardiography is inadequate, alternative imaging such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), cardiac computed tomography (CT), or radionuclide imaging is recommended for assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In patients with HF or cardiomyopathy, CMR can be useful for diagnosis or management, and in patients with HF, an evaluation for possible ischemic heart disease can be useful to identify the cause and guide management. In patients with HF and coronary artery disease who are candidates for coronary revascularization, noninvasive stress imaging (stress echocardiography, single-photon emission CT [SPECT], CMR, or positron emission tomography [PET]) may be considered for detection of myocardial ischemia to help guide coronary revascularization. In patients with HF without clinical status change, treatment interventions likely to affect cardiac function, or candidacy for invasive procedures or device therapy, routine repeat assessment of left ventricular (LV) function is not indicated.

### Clinical utility of routine cardiac monitoring in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab [^114xeMC9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Cardiotoxicity is a potential adverse effect, manifesting as either an asymptomatic decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction or infrequently as largely reversible symptomatic heart failure (HF). Monitoring recommendations differ between product labeling and 2012 guidelines, and the clinical utility of serial cardiac monitoring in patients with metastatic breast cancer remains controversial.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to describe the frequency of monitoring, incidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic HF, overall effect on treatment, and cost of monitoring for cardiotoxicity.

Methods

We preformed an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab from January 1, 2009, through January 1, 2014, at an academic medical center.

Results

Out of 154 treatments, 72% were adjuvant, and 28% were metastatic. In the adjuvant setting, a mean of 4.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4–5) echocardiograms (echos) over a mean of 11.5 (IQR = 11–12) months were performed. In the metastatic setting, a mean of 3.1 (IQR = 1–5) echos over a mean of 20.2 (IQR = 9–31) months were performed. Symptomatic HF events occurred in 4 adjuvant (3.6%) and 2 metastatic patients (6.5%); 10 patients (6.5%) had a treatment interruption, with 9 (90%) tolerating restart of trastuzumab. Two patients (1.3%) changed treatment as a result of cardiotoxicity. Using population incidence of HER2-positive breast cancer, $13 million could be saved if monitoring were reduced by 1 echo per patient.

Conclusions

Given the low incidence of clinically significant HF and cost of monitoring, less frequent monitoring may be justified.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^115DsUrB]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) non-invasive imaging — initial evaluation and follow-up are specified as follows: A two-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler should be performed during initial evaluation of patients presenting with HF to assess ventricular function, size, wall thickness, wall motion and valve function (Level of Evidence: C), and repeat measurement of ejection fraction (EF) and measurement of the severity of structural remodeling are useful to provide information in patients with HF who have had a significant change in clinical status; who have experienced or recovered from a clinical event; who have received treatment, including GDMT, that might have had a significant effect on cardiac function; or who may be candidates for device therapy (Level of Evidence: C). Under Class IIa, non-invasive imaging to detect myocardial ischemia and viability is reasonable in patients presenting with de novo HF, who have known coronary artery disease (CAD) and no angina, unless the patient is not eligible for re-vascularization of any kind (Level of Evidence: C); viability assessment is reasonable in select situations when planning re-vascularization in HF patients with CAD (Level of Evidence: B); radionuclide ventriculography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful to assess LVEF and volume when echocardiography is inadequate (Level of Evidence: C); and MRI is reasonable when assessing myocardial infiltrative processes or scar burden (Level of Evidence: B). Under Class III: No Benefit, routine repeat measurement of left ventricular (LV) function assessment in the absence of clinical status change or treatment interventions should not be performed (Level of Evidence: B).

### Not so young at heart: long-term cardiac dysfunction in young adult hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors [^113FowN5]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

First, this study highlights the role of cardiovascular surveillance using echocardiograms in HCT survivors. Heart failure is recognized as a progressive disorder where patients move from subclinical dysfunction to overt heart failure over a variable period. It is important to detect and intervene during an earlier stage because the course is largely irreversible once heart failure has progressed to an advanced stage. However, there is no clear guidance regarding the need for routine screening, its frequency, or duration among HCT survivors. Routine use of serial echocardiograms in childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors exposed to anthracyclines and/or radiation with potential impact to the heart is endorsed by the Children's Oncology Group long-term follow-up guidelines and International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group. In contrast, the international guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors do not provide any specific recommendations regarding echocardiographic surveillance. Recent publications have questioned the cost-effectiveness and reproducibility of echocardiograms in surveillance. This is especially relevant when considering cost- and resource-based challenges associated with performing routine serial echocardiograms for the entire and increasing numbers of HCT survivor population. The investigators do not tell us whether better technology adds substantially to the time-tested and widely available 2D echocardiography in identifying LVSD. Also, this study was not designed to tell us how and when to use echocardiography to screen for early cardiac dysfunction, and how often and in which patients these early changes progress to overt heart failure. However, the high prevalence of LVSD, especially in asymptomatic patients, makes the case for continued discovery of interventions to identify and mitigate progression of early cardiomyopathy.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — imaging, ejection fraction (EF), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and hemodynamic monitoring guidance emphasizes that serial chest radiographs are not recommended in the management of chronic HF, routine EF checks at frequent, regular, or arbitrary intervals are not recommended, and repeat EF assessment may be most useful when the patient has demonstrated a major change in clinical status. BNP-guided drug titration has not been shown to improve outcomes more effectively than achievement of target doses, and there is no established role for periodic invasive or noninvasive hemodynamic measurements in HF management, although invasive measurements may assist with volume status and distinguishing HF from other disorders; cardiac output and pulmonary wedge pressure via a pulmonary artery catheter have been used in refractory HF to assess pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac output can also be measured noninvasively.

### Is electrocardiography-left ventricular hypertrophy an obsolete marker for determining heart failure risk with hypertension? [^113uoTcX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The results from Johnson et al 2 offer new insights indicating how much we still do not understand about the complex underlying pathophysiology leading to HF and the importance of addressing not only BP control, but also other potential contributors to HF. At this time, routine imaging evaluation of LVH is not recommended because of limited data on the cost‐effectiveness for risk classification and management 1; in fact, routine evaluation of hypertension with echocardiogram received a score of 3 on the Appropriate Use Criteria from 2011, considering it inappropriate. 20 Contrarily, imaging can be helpful in young individuals, those with secondary hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, or HF symptoms. 1

For curtailing the persistent morbidity and mortality because of uncontrolled hypertension, the most prevalent and potent CVD risk factor, some questions related to LVH determination remain unanswered. Future research should help clarify whether beyond ECG‐LVH measurements, screening for LVH with echocardiogram, or even CMR, in patients with hypertension is useful, how we can adjust for factors that affect accuracy, and what is the best way and time to follow up and approach these patients therapeutically.

### The emerging role of echocardiography in the screening of patients at risk of heart failure [^111QiqaL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

A large number of patients without symptoms of heart failure (HF) have asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction owing to the compensatory mechanisms acting through the autonomic nervous system and neurohormones. In the setting of screening for prevention, one must identify the subgroup of these patients at high risk for symptomatic HF to establish appropriate therapy. As a first step to identify the subgroup of patients at high risk, clinical screening scores and natriuretic peptide measurements are used. Second, the definite diagnosis of asymptomatic LV dysfunction must be confirmed with echocardiography, occasionally with the help of new technologic developments to establish prompt, appropriate treatment to prevent disease progression. Therefore, the screening role of echocardiography is the early identification of patients with structural cardiopathy who are at risk of developing symptomatic HF and detection of those without LV dysfunction (diabetic and hypertensive) whose condition is prone to advance rapidly to structural cardiopathy or to symptomatic HF.

### Point-of-care ultrasound can make the difference in patients with heart failure at primary care [^111pi8C8]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) remains a major contributor to the global burden of cardiovascular disease, driven by increased life expectancy and a corresponding rise in its prevalence, mortality, and hospitalization rates, particularly among older populations. HF significantly impacts patients' quality of life and imposes considerable strain on healthcare systems worldwide. However, this economic and clinical burden can be mitigated through early identification and timely intervention, including the optimization of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies.

According to the American Heart Association guidelines, HF is categorized into four stages. Stages A and B, collectively termed "preclinical HF", include patients who do not exhibit clinical symptoms. Stage A (at-risk for HF) encompasses individuals at risk of developing HF due to predisposing conditions but without evidence of structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. In contrast, Stage B (pre-HF) refers to patients with structural or functional cardiac abnormalities that remain asymptomatic and undetectable on physical examination. Echocardiography serves as a critical diagnostic tool for identifying these abnormalities, highlighting the necessity of effective comorbidity management to improve prognostic outcomes in HF.

Accurate identification of HF in its early stages is a crucial first step in effective management. Family physicians (FP) are uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in this process, as they frequently oversee the care of patients with HF and those at elevated risk for its development, including individuals with diabetes, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease. However, disparities in medical and diagnostic resources across primary healthcare setting pose challenges, particularly in rural or underserved areas.

The electrocardiogram (ECG), a standard diagnostic tool in primary healthcare centers, has limited sensitivity and specificity for detecting HF, especially in its early stages. Although natriuretic peptides are an effective screening tool, their diagnostic accuracy is higher in patients presenting with symptoms of HF and those with systolic dysfunction than in asymptomatic patients or with diastolic dysfunction.

Laboratory resources and speed-change protocols — Whether to include pump "speed changes" is a frequent concern because this can be extremely labor- and time-intensive, and the distinct echocardiography data elements obtained at each pump speed are not well defined. In general, either a surveillance or a problem-focused exam at the LVAD's baseline pump speed should be equivalent to a comprehensive HF echocardiogram (not a limited study), with LVAD-specific imaging including 2D and Doppler interrogation of the inflow cannula, outflow graft, and aortic anastomosis (using TEE if indicated). Thereafter, a "limited" exam at each pump speed is recommended and should be targeted to the suspected problem. In stable, asymptomatic patients with normal LVAD function at baseline, subsequent pump speed data acquisition can proceed expediently and may even be optional for surveillance exams, depending on the center's internal standards. Minimal speed-change parameters are provided in the appendix and can be adapted for each patient; pump speed changes may be performed periodically in asymptomatic patients to establish a patient's own benchmark data for comparison on subsequent exams, and speed-change/ramp studies can be useful, if not critical, for problem-focused exams such as screening for pump malfunction in the setting of hemolysis and suspected impeller thrombosis and for the assessment of LV recovery. Special knowledge of contraindications and safety endpoints for speed changes is required by personnel performing, supervising, and interpreting these studies, with necessary information outlined in the text and listed in the tables and appendices.

### Tricuspid regurgitation: a review of current interventional management [^114Wwzzj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conservative Management

Medical management for TR is limited. TTE surveillance is used to monitor progression of TR severity. Neither the American Society of Echocardiography or AHA/ACC guidelines provide a specific recommendation for the frequency of surveillance. However, the 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines suggest TTE every 3 to 6 months for patients with severe mitral regurgitation. A similar approach may be reasonable to use in patients with severe TR to monitor annular dilation and RV function. The workhorse for medical management in TR is loop diuretics to relieve symptoms of right‐sided HF. No particular loop diuretic has demonstrated significant advantages versus others. It is important to note diuretics in TR have no morbidity or mortality benefit. Current medical management of iTR is solely based on symptom relief.

When to Refer to Valve Team

Centers that offer innovative valvular intervention do so with valve teams which consist of cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, nursing coordinators, research coordinators, and often neurologists. The 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines suggest consideration of intervention when a patient has TR with refractory right HF to address symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. Progressive annular dilation and presence of congestive hepatopathy are associated with poor long‐term outcomes and should prompt consideration of referral to a valve team. When it becomes severe, TR causes progressive right heart remodeling, which over time increasingly affects morbidity and mortality. Although RV remodeling is associated with poor outcomes it is not well understood if improved TR severity through intervention improves outcomes through RV remodeling. Outcomes following TV repair have been correlated to RV ejection fraction and end‐diastolic volumes; however, this is not well defined and there are no widely accepted quantifiable cutoffs to help guide which patients benefit most. This means we currently do not have a good understanding of which patients are optimal for intervention. We suggest referral to a valve team in any symptomatic patient with severe TR. The goal is to prevent irreversible right heart remodeling which is a chronic process. Therefore, the earlier referral the better.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^113aBTEn]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Right-sided disease: pulmonary embolism

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be challenging, because symptoms and signs are nonspecific. The transthoracic echocardiogram is normal in approximately 50% of unselected patients with acute pulmonary embolism, and has a sensitivity of 50–60% and specificity of 80–90%. Therefore, other investigations are used to confirm the diagnosis, with echocardiography used as a complementary imaging technique. The principal indirect echocardiographic findings are nonspecific, and include right heart dilatation, right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis (with or without apical sparing), abnormal septal motion, and inferior vena cava dilatation(FIG. 3a). Secondary tricuspid regurgitation might be present, allowing estimation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure using the simplified Bernoulli equation(FIG. 3b). Given that the right ventricle can generate a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of only ≤ 60 mmHg acutely, a higher pressure suggests a more chronic process (either multiple repeated episodes or chronic pulmonary parenchymal disease, with or without pulmonary embolism). Although the peak tricuspid regurgitation gradient is the most commonly used parameter to assess pulmonary artery systolic pressure in clinical practice, difficulties in the detection of good tricuspid regurgitation envelope might occur. Pulsed Doppler recordings of pulmonary valve flow acceleration time, pre-ejection period, and ejection time at the RV outflow tract can also be used to estimate pulmonary artery pressure and resistance.

Pericardial collection and tamponade

Echocardiography is pivotal for recognition of the haemodynamic consequences of a pericardial collection (FIG. 3c), allowing demonstration of features of tamponade including right atrial and/or RV diastolic collapse, in addition to guiding pericardiocentesis. A number of potential pitfalls exist when interpreting the echocardiographic features of tamponade in the acute setting. These pitfalls include the effects of positive pressure ventilation (reversal of changes in transvalvular flows) and localized collections, in particular after cardiac surgery when substantial haemodynamic compromise might be present, even in the absence of echocardiographic features of tamponade.

Monitoring of therapy

Echocardiography is not recommended for the monitoring of therapy in patients with AHF in the absence of cardiogenic shock, given the complexity of LAP estimation using echocardiography, its lack of association with pulmonary congestion and symptoms, and superiority of natriuretic peptide levels in monitoring response to therapy. An emerging area in which echocardiography might be of use is in risk stratification before discharge from hospital. In patients with AHF with dyspnoea, persistent pulmonary congestion before discharge (demonstrated on LUS) has been shown to be an independent predictor of rehospitalization for AHF at 6 months after discharge.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112bv1BM]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Consensus definitions of HFpEF (ACC/AHA/HFSA vs ESC) — The ACC/AHA/HFSA definition requires "EF ≥ 50% and:

- Clinical symptoms and/or signs of HF and
- **Diastolic dysfunction", whereas the ESC definition requires "EF ≥ 50% and**:

- Clinical symptoms and/or signs of HF and
- **Elevated NP levels and at least one of the following**: o Relevant structural heart disease (LVH and/or LAE) o Diastolic dysfunction". For natriuretic peptides, ACC/AHA/HFSA notes they "Can guide the diagnosis of HF, especially in the setting of clinical uncertainty", while ESC states they "Can guide the diagnosis or exclusion of HF" and that "Normal levels exclude HF". Echocardiography per ESC should "Evaluate for evidence of functional or structural abnormalities" with key structural and functional cutoffs including "LAVI > 34 mL/m²", "LVMI = 115 g/m² for men and ≥ 95 g/m² for women", "E/e′ ≥ 13", and "Mean e′ (mean of septal and lateral e′) < 9 cm/s", and ACC/AHA/HFSA emphasizes "EF measurement and assessment of valvular or myocardial abnormalities" and that "Evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction may be considered to define the syndrome of HFpEF". Invasive testing differs in that ACC/AHA/HFSA advise "RHC if refractory to initial therapy or if a specific clinical question needs to be addressed" and that "LHC is recommended if HF and angina present", while ESC notes "RHC at rest followed by exercise hemodynamics if below the threshold of PCWP 15 mm Hg, may be considered in cases of clinical uncertainty".

### Advances in echocardiographic imaging in heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction [^1135FTyw]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Echocardiography, given its safety, easy availability, and the ability to permit a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure and function, is an indispensable tool in the evaluation and management of patients with heart failure (HF). From initial phenotyping and risk stratification to providing vital data for guiding therapeutic decision-making and monitoring, echocardiography plays a pivotal role in the care of HF patients. The recent advent of multiparametric approaches for myocardial deformation imaging has provided valuable insights in the pathogenesis of HF, elucidating distinct patterns of myocardial dysfunction and events that are associated with progression from subclinical stage to overt HF. At the same time, miniaturization of echocardiography has further expanded clinical application of echocardiography, with the use of pocket cardiac ultrasound as an adjunct to physical examination demonstrated to improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification. Furthermore, ongoing advances in the field of big data analytics promise to create an exciting opportunity to operationalize precision medicine as the new approach to healthcare delivery that aims to individualize patient care by integrating data extracted from clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and genetic assessments. The present review summarizes the recent advances in the field of echocardiography, with emphasis on their role in HF phenotyping, risk stratification, and optimizing clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

In this study of cardiologists' appropriateness rates, high ordering cardiologists did not have higher rates of cardiac testing use or treatments than low ordering cardiologists, but did demonstrate lower use of potentially effective services, such as prescription medications for HF management, and fewer physician visits. This study highlights the need for research studying the relationship between appropriateness of cardiac services and outcomes in patients with HF to best design optimal HF treatment strategies.

### Natriuretic peptides and troponins: sufficient monitoring of cancer survivors? [^11791cix]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Adequate and continuous monitoring of childhood cancer survivors for heart failure and other cardiovascular adverse events is crucial for an early detection of cardiovascular disease. Despite the remarkable progress made in treating childhood cancers, the therapies employed (particularly anthracyclines and radiation therapy) can inadvertently inflict damage on the entire cardiovascular system, predisposing survivors to an increased risk of, eg, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, and arrhythmia later in life. Heart failure, a more commonly encountered long-term adverse event, is often linked to an inferior prognosis and quality of life, and contributes to a significant portion of premature deaths among cancer survivors. Moreover, the evaluation of a patient's risk for enduring cardiac complications from cancer treatments is contingent upon factors such as lifestyle choices and individual circumstances. These aspects underscore the importance of personalized assessments in predicting and managing long-term cardiotoxic effects in cancer survivors.

Programs aimed at long-term cardiac surveillance for individuals who have undergone therapy as children or adolescents need to established protocols for the early detection of adverse events. Given that cardiac complications may manifest early after therapy or years and decades after treatment completion, it is recommended to conduct vigilant cardiovascular monitoring for asymptomatic patients for many years. As time progresses, the frequency of echocardiography may be reduced (compared to monitoring during therapy) to alleviate concerns regarding excessive monitoring. A comprehensive examination is crucial, because echocardiography is adept at detecting diastolic dysfunction, valvular heart disease, or elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, alongside reduced left ventricular function (LVEF). Although strain analysis (global longitudinal strain [GLS]) holds promise as a prospectively ascertained routine echocardiographic parameter, its incorporation currently warrants individual consideration, particularly in longitudinal follow-up. In cases where sonographic limitations are encountered, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging serves as a viable alternative to echocardiography. Although the identification of reduced LVEF should prompt initiation of heart failure therapy even in asymptomatic patients, the clinical significance of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings such as late gadolinium enhancement necessitates further clarification. Similarly, the prognostic relevance of biomarkers in asymptomatic long-term cancer survivors remains inadequately understood, warranting additional research before implementation in routine heart failure screening. In the event of heart failure detection, treatment should adhere to current guideline recommendations, given the absence of tailored heart failure therapy recommendations specifically for long-term cancer survivors.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) speed-change testing — planning and safety guidance states that strong consideration should be given to deferring speed-change exams if baseline imaging shows a possible intracardiac or aortic root thrombus; a skilled and knowledgeable MCS team member should be immediately available before an optimization or problem-focused echo exam; unless actively supervised by MCS or experienced echocardiography medical staff, the ordering HF team should prospectively indicate test speeds, echo parameters at each speed, what defines the "optimal" LVAD speed, and what speed should be set at study conclusion; a structured ordering template may assist, and reasons to stop a speed-change (ramp) test include completion of the test, a suction event at higher speeds, new symptoms — including, but not limited to — palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or headache (which may be related to hypoperfusion or hypotension), hypertension, and cannula flow reversal.

### Heart failure in type 2 diabetes: current perspectives on screening, diagnosis and management [^116qbM3c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for screening and diagnosing heart failure in people with diabetes

Electrocardiography (ECG): ECG is recommended by the 2021 ESC guidelines as one measure to assess people with suspected acute or chronic HF and present symptoms and/or signs. In people with acute HF, ECG is recommended at the time of admission, during hospitalization, and pre-discharge. If the ECG is abnormal, the likelihood of HF is increasing. ECG allows additionally screening for unrecognized MI and thus could be helpful for risk stratification among high-risk persons for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, it provides information about etiology (e.g. MI, AF) and guides therapy. Nevertheless, the main use of an ECG is to rule out HF since a completely normal ECG indicates that HF is unlikely. The 2019 ESC guidelines on diabetes developed in collaboration with the European Society for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) (ESC-EASD recommendations) recommend a resting ECG in general when patients with diabetes have been diagnosed with hypertension.
Echocardiography: The clinical diagnosis of remodeling in HF is based on the detection of morphological changes such as changes in the cavity diameter, mass (hypertrophy and atrophy), and geometry (heart wall thickness and shape). Echocardiography is the most useful, non-invasive diagnostic method to detect these structural changes for evaluating systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, the 2021 ESC guidelines and the 2019 ESC-EASD recommendations define echocardiography as the first-choice approach to (1) assess cardiac function (LVEF and other parameters) for people with chronic HF and (2) to evaluate structural and functional abnormalities in people with diabetes since increased LV mass (LVM) and diastolic dysfunction are widely found in asymptomatic people. Also, elevated LVM is common in cases of hypertension. It is also well known that an increase of the LVM is already present with increasing age, obesity, and dyslipidemia, all common risk factors for T2D, but it also depends on body size and gender. Also, LV hypertrophy is a frequent abnormality in asymptomatic people with T2D. It was found in one-third of those without hypertension, even after excluding silent coronary disease. The LVM indexed to bovine serum albumin (BSA) allows the definition of reference values for the comparison of subjects with different body sizes. Normal values for LVM/BSA defined by the American Society for Endocrinology range from 43 to 95 g/m² for women and 49–115 g/m² for men.
Biomarker screening: The 2021 ESC guidelines (level of evidence: B) and the updated guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (ACC/AHA/HFSA) in 2017 recommend measurement of natriuretic peptides (either NT-proBNP or BNP) to identify "pre-HF" among individuals with diabetes. In contrast, the 2019 ESC-EASD guidelines do not recommend routine assessment of circulating biomarkers in general for CV risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with diabetes. However, the 2021 ESC guidelines and the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines argue that risk stratification by natriuretic peptide measurement can help to identify people at risk of developing HF (ACC/AHA stages A or B) who require further cardiac investigation by a cardiologist and initiate an early intervention for preventing HF. For acute HF people, determination of natriuretic peptides is recommended at the time of admission and pre-discharge. Similarly, the universal definition of HF defines the HF stages by elevated levels of natriuretic peptides and therefore recommends assessing NT-proBNP or BNP routinely in patients without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF. The universal definition of HF suggested the cut-off values for BNP and NT-proBNP of 35 pg/mL and 125 pg/mL for ambulatory HF people and of 100 pg/mL and 300 pg/mL for hospitalized/decompensated HF people, respectively. However, diagnosis of HF cannot be made solely on the basis of natriuretic peptide values because their diagnostic accuracy is influenced by CV and non-CV causes that weaken the informative value of the natriuretic peptide under conditions of obesity, AF, increasing age, and kidney disease. Therefore, natriuretic peptide determination is recommended for ruling out HF but not for diagnosing HF. To complement the informative diagnostic value of natriuretic peptides, further novel biomarkers are needed, including, e.g. secreted Frizzled-related proteins as independent biomarkers for myocardial fibrosis or risk stratification in HF or the gut microbiota-derived trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).
Assessment of glycemic parameters in HF subjects: Undiagnosed dysglycemia in people with HFrEF imparts a particularly poor prognosis. Therefore, the 2019 ESC-EASD guidelines recommend the determination of HbA1c and FPG to screen for diabetes in people with pre-existing CVD, with an OGTT carried out if FPG and HbA1c are inconclusive (level of evidence: A); and the 2021 ESC guidelines recommend routine blood tests including fasting glucose and HbA1c in patients with suspected chronic HF to screen for treatable causes of HF and co-morbidities which affect HF (level of evidence: C).
Strategies in people with diabetes to reduce the risk for HF: The 2019 ESC-EASD guidelines recommend routine assessment of microalbuminuria and eGFR in order to identify patients at high risk of renal dysfunction or future CVD. In addition, the Standards of Care 2021 from the ADA, the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines, and the 2019 ESC-EASD guidelines recommend a blood pressure target of < 130/80 mmHg (but not < 120 mmHg) in individuals with diabetes at CV risk since hypertension control is associated with a lower HF risk. The 2021 ESC guidelines agree with this recommendation but without target recommendations. In this context, it should be noted that masked hypertension in which ambulatory or home BP but not office BP readings are in the hypertensive range is highly prevalent in patients with T2D, making out-of-office BP monitoring a reasonable screening measure for this clinical condition. Patients with diabetes and hypertension should be examined by ECG at resting state in order to detect silent MI, which occurs in 4% of all diabetic patients, as insult for HF. Also, lifestyle changes and the administration of RAAS blockers as first-line treatment for blood pressure control are recommended for pre-diabetic people and the treatment of hypertensive people with diabetes. Moreover, the administration of RAAS blockers lowers the risk of new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death in HFrEF subjects.

Description of Echocardiographic Parameters

Structural heart disease was defined as reduced left ventricular systolic function, ventricular hypertrophy, or chamber enlargement on echocardiograms. Assessments of cardiac structure and function were performed using echocardiography according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Research transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained at the individual CRIC sites in accordance with a standardized imaging protocol across all participating clinical centers. Sonographers were initially trained in telephone conference calls and provided with a detailed scanning manual complete with a checklist. The CRIC Central Echocardiography Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania monitored quality control and adherence to the scanning protocol and provided the sites with evaluations of the quality of the first several hundred echocardiograms. Supplemental training was provided on an as‐needed basis. All echocardiograms were then quantified at the CRIC Central Echocardiography Laboratory by a single registered diagnostic cardiac sonographer who was blinded to the identity of participants.

Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined using the Cornell Criteria; abnormal was considered ≥ 50 g/m².⁷ for men and ≥ 47 g/m².⁷ for women. Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated using diastolic and systolic left ventricle volumes measured by the single‐plane Simpson rule method: left ventricular ejection fraction = [(Dvol2Svol)/Dvol]3100. Left ventricular ejection fraction was examined as a dichotomous variable, with a cutoff of ≥ 50% based on prior literature of preserved systolic function. Left atrial enlargement was defined as left atrial diameter ≥ 4.7 cm in men and left atrial diameter ≥ 4.3 cm in women.

### Heart failure, diastolic dysfunction and the role of… [^1113keU9]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The optimal management of heart failure begins with an accurate diagnosis. Echocardiography is an indispensable component of the diagnostic work-up. The purpose of echocardiography is twofold: noninvasive assessment for an underlying precipitating cause of symptoms, and evaluation of left ventricular function. Clinical detection of flow-dependent valvular disorders is often more difficult in the presence of low-output states. For example, the murmur associated with aortic stenosis may not be appreciated or its severity may be underestimated in a patient with heart failure. The treatment of choice for new-onset heart failure when the cause is critical aortic stenosis is valve replacement rather than medication.

Severe mitral or aortic regurgitation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension are other potential precipitating causes of heart failure that might be detected by echocardiography and that mandate a different approach to treatment. The second reason to routinely obtain echocardiograms on virtually all patients with new-onset heart failure is to determine whether heart failure is primarily the result of systolic dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction, or some combination. Although Hoyt and Bowling 1 intentionally limit the scope of their discussion to the management of patients with systolic dysfunction, family physicians must be equally skilled in the evaluation and treatment of patients with diastolic dysfunction. Primary diastolic dysfunction accounts for the symptoms of heart failure in at least one third of cases. 2 Left ventricular contractility is normal or increased in these patients.

The problem is that a physical examination cannot reliably distinguish between systolic and diastolic dysfunction because there is overlap of almost all signs and symptoms in these two forms of heart failure. 3 Echocardiographic confirmation of diastolic dysfunction as the cause of heart failure is made not only on the basis of finding normal or increased contractility, but also on the basis of the presence of normal ventricular function that occurs in association with concentric hypertrophy and reduced ventricular compliance, as determined by Doppler examination. In summary, Hoyt and Bowling 1 suggest that management of heart failure will often involve a joint effort between family physicians and cardiologists. Attention given to the factors discussed in their article, active collaboration with cardiology colleagues and a keen awareness of when to refer patients should allow major assumption of the ambulatory care of these patients by family physicians in the majority of cases. 5.

### Translating the 2021 ESC heart failure guideline recommendations in daily practice: results from a heart failure survey. A scientific statement of the ESC council for cardiology practice and the heart failure association of the ESC [^114NHR33]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Real-world data show that guidelines are insufficiently implemented, and particularly guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) are underused in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in clinical practice. The Council for Cardiology Practice and the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) developed a survey aiming to (i) evaluate the perspectives of the cardiology community on the 2021 ESC heart failure (HF) guidelines, (ii) pinpoint disparities in disease management, and (iii) propose strategies to enhance adherence to HF guidelines.

Methods and Results

A 22-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HFrEF was delivered between March and June 2022. Of 457 physicians, 54% were general cardiologists, 19.4% were HF specialists, 18.9% other cardiac specialists, and 7.7% non-cardiac specialists. For diagnosis, 52.1% employed echocardiography and natriuretic peptides (NPs), 33.2% primarily used echocardiography, and 14.7% predominantly relied on NPs. The first drug class initiated in HFrEF was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ACEi/ARNi) (91.2%), beta-blockers (BB) (73.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (53.4%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (48.1%). The combination ACEi/ARNi + MRA+ BB was preferred by 39.3% of physicians, ACEi/ARNi + SGLT2 inhibitors + BB by 33.3%, and ACEi/ARNi + BB by 22.2%. The time required to initiate and optimize GDMT was estimated to be < 1month by 8.3%, 1–3months by 52%, 3–6months by 31.8%, and > 6months by 7.9%. Compared to general cardiologists, HF specialists/academic cardiologists reported lower estimated time-to-initiation, and more commonly preferred a parallel initiation of GDMT rather than a sequential approach.

Conclusion

Participants generally followed diagnostic and treatment guidelines, but variations in HFrEF management across care settings or HF specialties were noted. The survey may raise awareness and promote standardized HF care.

### Imaging in patients with suspected acute heart failure: timeline approach position statement on behalf of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^1169SWwA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure is one of the main diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in clinical practice due to a non-specific clinical manifestation and the urgent need for timely and tailored management at the same time. In this position statement, the Heart Failure Association aims to systematize the use of various imaging methods in accordance with the timeline of acute heart failure care proposed in the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. During the first hours of admission the point-of-care focused cardiac and lung ultrasound examination is an invaluable tool for rapid differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea, which is highly feasible and relatively easy to learn. Several portable and stationary imaging modalities are being increasingly used for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function, haemodynamic and volume status, precipitating myocardial ischaemia or valvular abnormalities, and systemic and pulmonary congestion. This paper emphasizes the central role of the full echocardiographic examination in the identification of heart failure aetiology, severity of cardiac dysfunction, indications for specific heart failure therapy, and risk stratification. Correct evaluation of cardiac filling pressures and accurate prognostication may help to prevent unscheduled short-term readmission. Alternative advanced imaging modalities should be considered to assist patient management in the pre- and post-discharge phase, including cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, nuclear studies, and coronary angiography. The Heart Failure Association addresses this paper to the wide spectrum of acute care and heart failure specialists, highlighting the value of all available imaging techniques at specific stages and in common clinical scenarios of acute heart failure.

### Echocardiographic subtypes of heart failure in consecutive hospitalised patients with dyspnoea [^117VW8mD]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) involves 50% of hospitalised patients with heart failure (HF), but evaluation of the scale of the problem varies due to unclear diagnostic criteria, comorbidity and various types of hospitals. Previous registry studies of HF epidemiology were not based on comprehensive echocardiograms, and they rarely describe the underlying subtype of HF. Knowing the subtype of HF is essential for selecting evidence-based treatment, but there seems to be a mismatch between patients entering randomised clinical trials and patients seen in clinical practice.

Recent guidelines authorise the use of natriuretic peptide to rule out HF; they acknowledge left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and enlarged left atrium (LA) as a reason for HFpEF and give clear criteria for diastolic dysfunction. The doorway to finding patients with HF is to examine patients with dyspnoea, and therefore, we asked, 'what is the diagnostic outcome of applying novel guideline criteria including a comprehensive echocardiogram to consecutive patients admitted with dyspnea?'.

We used a prospective observational study to describe the subtype of cardiac dysfunction, if any, among all comers admitted with dyspnoea. Although data were collected in 2010, the recent 2016 guidelines were used to diagnose HFpEF and 'HFmrEF'(midrange LV EF from 40% to 49%). The aim was to describe the frequency of subtypes of cardiac dysfunction in patients hospitalised with dyspnoea and elevated NT-proBNP, in relation to HFpEF, HFmrEF and HF due to reduced EF (HFrEF) and to examine the impact of non-cardiac comorbidity.

### Echocardiography in the management of patients with left ventricular assist devices: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113QUaSz]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Frequency and extent of echocardiography — Routine surveillance echocardiography is useful for confirming normal LVAD function and assessing the native cardiac response to LVAD support over time. Routine follow-up surveillance echo exams are recommended to screen for the development of known LVAD complications that may begin in an occult fashion (before symptoms or device alarms). Reported complications include de novo or worsening AR, inappropriate speed settings due to either improvement or deterioration of native heart function, internal pump thrombosis, other outflow obstruction, aortic root thrombus, aortic cusp fusion, and ongoing/smoldering HF in inactive patients. From an abundance of caution, some centers may perform too-frequent and/or too-detailed echocardiographic examinations, and these guidelines may be useful for establishing the optimal frequency of echocardiography examination, based on individual patient circumstances. These recommendations also may help establish a reasonable timetable for routine follow-up examination of patients who are doing well or who may be able to have an LVAD echo exam in a laboratory closer to their home.

Table 3
Identification of the Patient at Increased Risk of Cardiotoxicity

Table 4
Frequency of Echocardiographic Monitoring During Anthracycline or Trastuzumab (Anti-HER2) Therapy According to Published Guidelines

The optimum frequency of echocardiograms during and after cancer therapy is unclear especially in the context of current pandemics (e.g. COVID-19). Recommendations for echocardiography during and after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy also differ, with the majority of guidelines not quantifying frequency of monitoring. There is wide variation in guideline recommendations on the frequency of echocardiographic monitoring for patients receiving trastuzumab, ranging from every 3 months to an undefined "periodically" (Table 4). Furthermore, there is no strong evidence to support a specific schedule of screening or any evidence that it improves outcomes for screened patients. However, screening every 3 months is still recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, although the frequency is admittedly controversial, and compliance is limited.

Historically, trastuzumab has been temporarily held or even discontinued in patients who develop LV systolic dysfunction. However, there are increasing data to suggest that patients with asymptomatic reductions in LVEF to 40% to 49%, with guidance from a cardio-oncology team and personalized monitoring and treatment, can safely complete their cancer treatment without a significant increase in cardiac events. We therefore recommend a personalized approach to patient surveillance, as emphasized in a position statement from the Heart Failure Association–European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.

Echocardiography 3 to 12 months post-cardiotoxic treatment is recommended in all patients, with the optimum timing dependent upon the individual patient's risk. Appropriate frequency of repeat echocardiography thereafter remains to be fully defined and depends upon whether any cardiotoxicity occurred during the treatment phase, with international recommendations varying from 1- to 5-year intervals. Decisions regarding long-term surveillance should take into consideration a patient's total anthracycline dose, exposure to other potentially cardiotoxic treatments (including radiotherapy), cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiotoxicity during treatment, and LV systolic function during and at the end of treatment.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1165Skcq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — clinical diagnosis requires the presence of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF) and an echocardiographic determination of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) generally accepted to be ≥ 50% in the absence of other cardiac or noncardiac causes for the patient's symptoms. The recognition of the clinical HF syndrome is the first step in diagnosing HFpEF; although the Framingham criteria demonstrate excellent specificity for the diagnosis of HF, they lack sensitivity, particularly in elderly patients who may have not had acute HF decompensation, and therefore a patient may have HFpEF even in the absence of satisfying specific clinical criteria for HF. Early presenting symptoms of HFpEF may be relatively nonspecific, including exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or fatigue, and clinical suspicion should be further raised if these symptoms occur with one or more commonly associated risk factors, including history of hypertension, elderly age (> 60 years), obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m²), history of diabetes mellitus, or history of atrial fibrillation.

IVRT — physiology, thresholds, and limitations: IVRT reflects the time interval aortic valve closure and MV opening and the crossover between LA and LV pressures, with duration directly related to LV relaxation and inversely related to LAP; it is overall feasible and reproducible, and when IVRT markedly prolonged (> 110 ms) LAP likely normal whereas a short IVRT (< 70 ms) has a high specificity for elevated LAP in patients with cardiac disease; however, IVRT has limited use in isolation, is age-dependent and preload-dependent, is affected by heart rate and arterial pressure, can be more challenging to measure and interpret with tachycardia, and identification of the onset of MV opening can be challenging.

Echocardiography in AHF

Driven by progressive advances in ultrasonography technology and an expanding evidence base, the use of echocardiography has extended beyond the traditional application in stable patients to become widespread in the acute and emergency settings. Mirroring the concept of critical care, echocardiography is increasingly used as a tool to guide management of the most acutely unwell patients wherever they present along the management pathway. Pocket-sized devices have been recommended in the emergency department, intensive care unit, and coronary units for fast initial qualitative screening of ventricular and valvular function, pericardial and pleural effusion, or extravascular lung water. However, owing to the known limitations of this technique, they are not intended as a substitution for comprehensive echocardiography. Remote expert review of images is now a possibility, and in the future, telemedicine will probably have an important role in guiding the assessment and management of these acutely unwell patients.

Echocardiography is used in AHF to help to confirm diagnosis, delineate potential underlying causes, identify associated pathophysiology, and monitor the response to therapy. Echocardiography can also be used to guide specialist interventions in the catheter laboratory or operating room –. Furthermore, echocardiography can address several major questions, including whether a patient has a cardiac cause for their symptoms and signs, the severity of the cardiac impairment and its physiological effect, whether there is an underlying reversible cause, what the most appropriate initial treatment is, and how the patient responds to treatment.

Guidelines recommend immediate echocardiographic assessment for patients with suspected AHF with haemodynamic instability; however, interpretation of echocardiographic data in these acutely unwell patients can be extremely complex (TABLE 1). First, the finding of a structurally or functionally abnormal heart does not necessarily mean the cause of dyspnoea is cardiac-related. Second, patients might be misdiagnosed as having primary respiratory disease, even in the presence of very severe cardiac pathology. Third, substantial cardiac and respiratory disease might coexist, and determining the degree of cardiac contribution is frequently challenging in this setting. These considerations are further compounded by the relative paucity of high-quality evidence to support the use of echocardiography techniques in the acute arena, as they have been predominantly validated in the outpatient clinic.

### Evaluation and monitoring of patients with acute heart failure syndromes [^117FUNyY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Advanced heart failure (HF) is associated with frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and increased mortality. Despite optimal medical management, readmission rates remain high and account for approximately two thirds of all costs related to HF management. Evaluation of patients with HF is critical for the appropriate selection and monitoring of therapy as well as for the prevention of recurrent hospitalizations. This evaluation can be complex and relies on integration of the bedside evaluation and information available from invasive and other noninvasive diagnostic techniques. The clinical examination remains the cornerstone of HF evaluation. Key features of the history and physical examination can be used to assign hemodynamic profiles based on the absence or presence of congestion and adequacy of perfusion. These hemodynamic profiles provide prognostic information and may be used to guide therapy. Direct measurement of hemodynamics may be helpful in patients in whom the physical examination is limited or discordant with symptoms. Although the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not recommended during routine therapy of patients hospitalized with HF, it is reasonable to consider the use of PAC monitoring to adjust therapy in patients who demonstrate recurrent or refractory symptoms despite ongoing standard therapy adjusted according to clinical assessment. This is particularly relevant in centers with experience in hemodynamic monitoring for HF. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing has been shown to facilitate diagnosis of the etiology of dyspnea in the urgent setting for patients without a prior diagnosis of HF. Furthermore, BNP levels provide important prognostic information in patients with chronic HF, but serial BNP testing has not been validated as a guide to inpatient or outpatient management. Echocardiographic assessment can provide prognostic information about ventricular function and size as well as information about hemodynamic status. Development of validated and reproducible noninvasive techniques to monitor patients with acute HF will be an important step in maximizing interventions to improve outcomes in this patient population.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected and known heart failure: 2024 update [^1123catf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and complex clinical syndrome with no single reference standard diagnostic test. Imaging has a supportive role in patients with suspected and known HF, including initial imaging assessment of an adult with suspected HF, but without history of HF, including evaluation of pulmonary edema and detection of left ventricular dysfunction (Variant 1). In adults with established diagnosis of HF but unknown etiology, imaging also has an important role in the assessment of the underlying disease process, including ischemic and nonischemic etiologies (Variant 2). In the course of continuing care for adult patients with an established diagnosis of HF without new symptoms, follow-up imaging is performed to assess for longitudinal changes in ventricular function, response to therapy and prognostication (Variant 3). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Cardiac arrest

The most extreme presentation of cardiogenic shock is cardiac arrest. International evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of echocardiography to diagnose or exclude some of the causes of arrest. However, echocardiography should not affect the delivery of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and specific training in advanced cardiovascular life support is required, even for experienced practitioners. As images are obtained and recorded only during the pulse/rhythm check, studies performed during cardiac arrest are strictly time-limited, and therefore are dissimilar to comprehensive studies that use only focused 2D imaging aimed at diagnosis or exclusion of potentially reversible causes in a simple, binary manner. The pathology leading to arrest is likely to be extreme (tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, severe LV and/or RV dysfunction, myocardial infarction/ischaemia, hypovolaemia, or tension pneumothorax) and fairly easy to diagnose without more sophisticated echocardiographic techniques. Whether the use of echocardiography in cardiac arrest (and as part of care after resuscitation) can improve outcomes is unknown, but its application in the prehospital setting has been found to change management strategies in up to 60% of patients.

### Factors associated with maintenance of an improved ejection fraction: an echocardiogram-based registry study [^111WjA23]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) has been increasingly recognized as a distinct clinical entity, with unique characteristics that differ from the long‐established syndromes of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. HFimpEF is currently defined by an initial clinical presentation of heart failure and an accompanying left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, with subsequent improved LVEF on follow‐up imaging. While these patients can now be identified with routine echocardiography, assessing and stratifying their likelihood for maintained LVEF > 40%, as well as their risk for future cardiac events, remains a challenge. While current guidelines support continuing patients with HFimpEF on the same guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) recommended for all patients with HFrEF, evidence remains relatively limited as to which characteristics are key prognostic indicators in this heterogeneous group of patients.

A randomized trial aimed to assess the phased withdrawal of GDMT in patients with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and improved ejection fraction (EF) demonstrated a higher rate of HFrEF relapse in patients that discontinue GDMT. These findings encouraged the revision of the terminology from heart failure with recovered EF to HFimpEF, since studies have demonstrated that the improved EF does not represent a true recovery of normal cardiac function. Factors associated with HFimpEF have been previously described. Evidence to date suggests that younger age, female sex, and the lack of history of ischemic heart disease have all been associated with initial improvement in EF. However, factors associated with maintenance of an improved LVEF remain largely unknown.

Using a large cohort of patients with HFrEF who demonstrated subsequent improvement in LVEF, we assessed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic interventions associated with maintaining an improved LVEF beyond 9 months after the initial improvement phase.

Ongoing evaluation of patients — once the nature and cause of the structural abnormalities leading to the development of HF have been defined, healthcare providers should focus on the clinical assessment of patients, both during the initial presentation and during subsequent visits. This clinical assessment should identify symptoms and their functional consequences and should evaluate the short- and long-term risks of disease progression and death whenever appropriate. This ongoing review of the patient's clinical status is critical to the appropriate selection and monitoring of treatments.

Definition of echocardiographic monitoring — Echocardiography is being used as a monitoring tool if, after a diagnostic assessment, repetitive hemodynamic and/or anatomic assessments are made over a period of minutes, hours, or days in the same patient to guide management; this encompasses monitoring of therapeutic cardiac or noncardiac interventions, including fluid resuscitation, pericardial effusion monitoring, LVAD ramp or weaning protocols, and perioperative care.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^113EqN7i]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

LV ejection fraction has been the main parameter used for the diagnosis, treatment, and stratification of patients with heart failure. However, this parameter has several limitations that are particularly relevant in the acute setting, such as load-dependency and inotropydependency. Even in the absence of high-quality 2D images, Doppler abnormalities in transmitral filling might provide an early indicator of important pathology.

Unlike LUS, echocardiography might be challenging to perform well and interpret accurately, as a number of considerations add to the complexity of its application in the acute setting. First, in all parameters described for LAP estimation, the confounding factors imposed by critical illness (changes in heart rate, cardiac output, LV compliance, and volume and ventilatory status) have not been fully evaluated. Second, not only might patients with a relatively normal LAP have radiographic and sonographic evidence of pulmonary oedema, but conversely, patients with chronically elevated LAP might have no evidence of pulmonary oedema. Similarly to LUS, however, the echocardiographic findings should be integrated with those from clinical examination, laboratory investigations, and lung imaging data (radiographic and/or sonographic), and be assessed within the clinical context. The main value of echocardiography in this setting is to diagnose or exclude an underlying cardiac cause for dyspnoea and guide subsequent interventions.

### 2022 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association / Heart Failure Society of America guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary [^113vV3GJ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (AHA/ACC/HFSA) Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure replaces the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure and the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose and manage patients with heart failure.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews and other evidence conducted in human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies published through September 2021 were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021.

Results and Conclusions

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain treatments that have high-quality published economic analyses.

### The euroHeart failure survey programme – a survey on the quality of care among patients with heart failure in europe. part 1: patient characteristics and diagnosis [^112zeuRZ]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has published guidelines for the investigation of patients with suspected heart failure and, if the diagnosis is proven, their subsequent management. Hospitalisation provides a key point of care at which time diagnosis and treatment may be refined to improve outcome for a group of patients with a high morbidity and mortality. However, little international data exists to describe the features and management of such patients. Accordingly, the EuroHeart Failure survey was conducted to ascertain if appropriate tests were being performed with which to confirm or refute a diagnosis of heart failure and how this influenced subsequent management.

Methods

The survey screened consecutive deaths and discharges during 2000–2001 predominantly from medical wards over a 6-week period in 115 hospitals from 24 countries belonging to the ESC, to identify patients with known or suspected heart failure.

Results

A total of 46788 deaths and discharges were screened from which 11327 (24%) patients were enrolled with suspected or confirmed heart failure. Forty-seven percent of those enrolled were women. Fifty-one percent of women and 30% of men were aged > 75 years. Eighty-three percent of patients had a diagnosis of heart failure made on or prior to the index admission. Heart failure was the principal reason for admission in 40%. The great majority of patients (> 90%) had had an ECG, chest X-ray, haemoglobin and electrolytes measured as recommended in ESC guidelines, but only 66% had ever had an echocardiogram. Left ventricular ejection fraction had been measured in 57% of men and 41% of women, usually by echocardiography (84%) and was < 40% in 51% of men but only in 28% of women. Forty-five percent of women and 22% of men were reported to have normal left ventricular systolic function by qualitative echocardiographic assessment. A substantial proportion of patients had alternative explanations for heart failure other than left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, including valve disease. Within 12 weeks of discharge, 24% of patients had been readmitted. A total of 1408 of 10434 (13.5%) patients died between admission and 12 weeks follow-up.

Conclusions

Known or suspected heart failure comprises a large proportion of admissions to medical wards and such patients are at high risk of early readmission and death. Many of the basic investigations recommended by the ESC were usually carried out, although it is not clear whether this was by design or part of a general routine for all patients being admitted regardless of diagnosis. The investigation most specific for patients with suspected heart failure (echocardiography) was performed less frequently, suggesting that the diagnosis of heart failure is still relatively neglected. Most men but a minority of women who underwent investigation of cardiac function had evidence of moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction, the main target of current advances in the treatment of heart failure. Considerable diagnostic uncertainty remains for many patients with suspected heart failure, even after echocardiography, which must be resolved in order to target existing and new therapies and services effectively.

LVAD surveillance echocardiography — Patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course should undergo LVAD surveillance echocardiography at certain predetermined intervals after LVAD implantation to assess the patient's response to MCS therapy and to screen for the development of subclinical complications, and when possible, LVAD surveillance echocardiography should be coordinated with routine LVAD clinic visits; serial comparisons can also help the examiner understand a patient's response to LVAD therapy over time, surveillance data may allow early diagnosis of occult native heart abnormalities or other device-related problems including a drift from previously optimal device speed settings, and a putative benefit of routine LVAD surveillance echocardiograms is improved patient outcomes, including early detection and treatment of complications and reduced hospitalizations for recurrent HF.

Echocardiography — left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) is a measure of LV systolic function, with impaired LV GLS common in some patients with HFpEF indicating subclinical LV dysfunction. Reported advantages are that it is a more sensitive index than EF, can provide earlier detection of myocardial disease when EF is normal, can be more reproducible than EF, and may better discriminate outcomes in HFrEF and HFpEF. Reported limitations include the need for dedicated software, susceptibility to suboptimal image quality, load dependence, and inter-vendor variability that may limit interchangeability of results.

### Management of chronic heart failure in adults: synopsis of the national institute for health and clinical excellence guideline [^112ciVdj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Description

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence released its first clinical guideline on heart failure in 2003. This synopsis describes the update of that guideline, which was released in August 2010 and discusses the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of heart failure.

Methods

Guideline developers considered clinical evidence, health economic analyses, clinical expert opinion, and patient views. Systematic literature searches were performed, and an original decision model assessed the cost-effectiveness of serial measurement of serum natriuretic peptide to monitor patients with chronic heart failure.

Recommendations

First, this guideline update describes the role of serum natriuretic peptide measurement, echocardiography, and specialist assessment in the diagnosis of heart failure. Second, it presents a pathway for pharmacologic treatment, rehabilitation, and pacing therapy (including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy) for patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction and patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. Finally, it explains the recommendation to monitor patients with heart failure by using serial measurement of serum natriuretic peptide.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^112wMfoL]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome in which signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF) occur despite a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line imaging modality but disparities in patient pathways across the UK can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to develop and validate a consistent, clinically appropriate and practical approach for reporting the echocardiographic suspicion of HFpEF.

Methods

Using the Delphi method, a steering group of nine UK experts identified key domains for discussion and generated consensus statements relevant to the echocardiographic detection of HFpEF. Using a four-point Likert scale, a survey including all statements was disseminated among a wider audience of healthcare professionals to determine agreement. A consensus threshold of 75% agreement was defined as 'strong' and ≥ 90% as 'very strong'.

Results

A total of 34 consensus statements were generated in seven domains: (1) challenges in the system approach to HFpEF; (2) enhancing referral for specialist review including echocardiography; (3) confidence in using a summary statement in an echo report; (4) identifying HFpEF and its underlying aetiology; (5) HF awareness, training and education; (6) refining multidisciplinary team roles in decision-making; (7) optimising patient experience.135 UK specialists experienced in managing HF participated in the survey, including physiologists/clinical scientists (n = 43), HF specialist nurses (n = 35), cardiologists (n = 34), general practitioners (n = 12), pharmacists (n = 4) and others (n = 7). 20 of 34 (59%) statements achieved very strong agreement, 10 of 34 (29%) achieved strong agreement and 4 of 34 (12%) did not meet the consensus threshold.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of HFpEF requires access to essential diagnostic tools. Establishing standardised pathways for specialist assessment and referral, including TTE reporting of HFpEF, may help eliminate diagnostic delays and geographical disparities. Further education and awareness are crucial for improving detection rates, prompt referral and patient experience.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^114d2Vns]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This Delphi consensus resulted in a set of recommendations aimed at addressing significant gaps and improving healthcare services and outcomes for patients with HFpEF.

HFpEF pathways should be standardised across the UK with timely referral for specialist review and echocardiography assessment

At the policy level, there is widespread recognition of the need to improve the prioritisation of HFpEF across all levels of healthcare settings. The management of these patients is a significant problem within the UK healthcare system due to the complexity of the condition.

A standardised approach to reporting suspected HFpEF, including relevant diagnostic features, may help to minimise duplicate requests (eg, from primary and secondary care). However, it is recognised that increased availability of echocardiography services and specialists is needed to reduce waiting times, which can exceed a year in some regions. The need for a standardised approach for diagnosis and treatment was also identified in the 2023 American College of Cardiology expert consensus on HFpEF.

Services should consider the development and adoption (or incorporation into existing processes) of a referral form for specialist assessment to serve as a basic diagnostic algorithm and encourage appropriate referrals

The term 'form' here could represent an example structure for information flow to ensure collection of a minimum dataset to standardise the referral process. At its most basic, this may be in the form of a printed copy but may also be adopted into current electronic reporting systemsin use in the NHS and potential integration into AI-driven reporting algorithms supported by an evidence base.

This Delphi consensus demonstrated national agreement with NICE guidance, which outlined that diagnosing HF requires a full specialist assessment, with echocardiography being a key component.NICE guidelines recommend that echocardiography be performed within 2 weeks for patients with significantly elevated NT-proBNP levels and within 6 weeks for moderately elevated values. Results of this study demonstrate a strong awareness of these guidelines among specialists. However, there is significant variation across the UK in meeting these timelines. While some regions have urgent referral pathways, others do not, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment that negatively impact patient outcomes.

Timely referral of patients to HF specialists can reduce hospital admissions, alleviate demand on outpatient clinics, and improve patient outcomes and experience. However, patients with HF face challenges in accessing specialist services in the UK, indicating that the referral process is inconsistent. In practice, current referral forms often lack essential information and do not effectively facilitate communication between specialists. An amended referral form could include NT-proBNP, signs and symptoms of HF as a minimum data set to address these gaps.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^114UrdnT]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4.1 Recommendation 5

Discuss clinical urgency and level of echocardiography with a clinician.

1.4.1.1 Background to Recommendation 5

The need for clinical collaboration is greater for inpatient than for outpatient requests since the presentation may be acute, not necessarily associated with a murmur and the dangers of progression much higher.

There can be no safe target time‐delays and every case must be considered individually.

No level of echocardiography is universally applicable. A combination of a basic/level 1 study can be used to exclude life‐threatening pathology and a minimum standard study performed at greater leisure if required.

1.4.1.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Incidental murmur in a patient admitted with a nonvalve problem for example, neck of femur fracture. It is reasonable to perform a basic/level 1 study in patients with a murmur as an emergency if identifying HVD will change management.

After insertion of an electrical device or other invasive intervention a basic/level 1 study is frequently sufficient to exclude a new pericardial effusion.
In an acutely unwell patient, a basic/level 1 study may indicate the need for immediate life‐saving treatment.

1.4.1.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

Predischarge after cardiac surgery to detect pathology that might require immediate management for example, large pericardial effusion or LV dysfunction or prosthetic valve dysfunction.

1.4.1.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Patients with known HVD admitted with heart failure.
Murmur after acute myocardial infarction since it may indicate mitral regurgitation or a VSD.
Urgent echocardiography should be done if there is unexplained LV failure or shock since these might complicate critical HVD.

1.4.1.1.4 Examples of Studies Often Not Indicated

Fever with a low clinical likelihood of infective endocarditis (see recommendation 6).
Recent TTE with no evidence of clinical deterioration.

LVAD problem-focused echocardiography — an LVAD problem-focused echocardiography exam should be performed whenever the heart failure (HF) team suspects a problem with LVAD function, with triggers including: 1) an LVAD controller alarm, 2) new or abnormally persistent symptoms, 3) abnormal serologic findings that suggest intravascular hemolysis or infection, 4) follow-up testing of abnormalities detected on an echocardiogram at the baseline pump speed, and 5) other abnormal imaging data, monitored results (eg, arrhythmias, hypotension), or other clinical tests suggesting LVAD malfunction. To maximize efficiency, the HF team should provide the echo lab personnel with the study indications. Regardless of indication, the exam begins with all elements of an LVAD surveillance exam performed at the baseline pump speed setting and does not include any speed changes; it may generally be performed by a sonographer without MCS staff unless the patient is unstable. Subsequent speed-change testing varies by suspected problem and response, and frequently requires the immediate availability of MCS team members and/or trained echo medical staff.

Secondary care specialist physicians within the HF MDT should discuss echocardiography results with patients within 2 weeks and create management plans to be shared with primary care specialists

While inconsistencies in the availability of specialist services have been reported across the UK, HFpEF management requires an MDT approach involving close collaboration between primary care professionals and specialists. Independent work between primary and secondary care can lead to a lack of communication, different approaches to patient care and reduced efficacy in managing HF. Guidelines highlight the importance of the MDT, as multidisciplinary input can optimise treatment, reduce hospital admissions and mortality and improve patient adherence, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of care.

As part of the HF MDT echocardiographers or advanced clinical scientists should be included to interpret echocardiography results

Specialist management plans should ensure appropriate treatment, improve care quality and support non-specialists who may lack confidence in HFpEF diagnosis and management.NICE chronic HF guidelines state that a care plan should be provided for every person identified with HF. Additionally, echocardiography results should be routinely discussed with patients, with echocardiography integrated into specialist HF assessments.

Education of HCPs on HFpEF diagnosis and management pathways is important for improving patient outcomes

HFpEF remains a major healthcare problem in the UK, with high levels of undiagnosed cases and uncertainties in patient management. Additional education and awareness are needed, particularly for primary care specialists, to improve diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first attempt to bring key UK stakeholders together to discuss echocardiographic reporting of suspected HFpEF and achieve consensus. Strengths of this study include wide representation of roles from diverse regions across the UK and a strong correlation in agreement among the different roles.

Limitations include the potential impact of statement wording on agreement levels, biases in respondent motivation, ambiguity around what defines an HF 'specialist' and lower representation from Scotland and Northern Ireland. The high level of agreement reported after the first round of survey suggests that there may have been a lack of challenge in some statements, and that these were designed to gain agreement and therefore introduce bias. Moreover, respondents were specialists with a particular interest in HF, which can impact results and may not be representative of the general population of HCPs. Also, there will be significant resources required to implement the recommendations, and further work, including health economic modelling, may be required to assess the impact on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

Inotropes and vasoactive agents

Although inotropes and vasopressors are commonly used to improve cardiac output and blood pressure in patients with cardiogenic shock, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular agent in this context. Dobutamine is generally the first-line inotrope of choice in the clinic. The detrimental effects of positive inotropic agents have been extensively described in the literature, and their use should, therefore, be restricted to the shortest possible duration and the lowest dose, both individualized to the patient. Although little guidance exists on how inotrope treatment should be individualized, echocardiography might be helpful in certain scenarios.

First, not all patients with cardiac disease respond to escalating doses of dobutamine by increasing their stroke volume; in some patients, dobutamine can result in an increase in the total isovolumic time (tIVT). Echocardiographic identification of an abnormally prolonged tIVT with dobutamine use, or an increase in tIVT in response to escalating inotropic support might indicate that inotropes are directly impairing myocardial performance, thereby prompting a reduction in dose or a change in treatment strategy – (FIG. 5). Second, the combination of LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and low aortic root pressure might result in a mismatch of coronary perfusion and myocardial oxygen demand. If untreated, this mismatch can result in type 2 myocardial infarction(FIG. 3d). Echocardiographic demonstration of a dominant or isolated A wave on transmitral Doppler in combination with postejection shortening can also be diagnostic (FIG. 6a, b), and indicates that aortic root pressure should be increased and/or LVEDP reduced. Third, physiological studies have demonstrated that the combination of RV ischaemia and increased RV afterload is particularly injurious to RV performance, resulting in a fall in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output levels. Echocardiography can be used to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, as well as measure RV dimensions and performance. Echocardiographic identification of high pulmonary vascular resistance with or without pulmonary hypertension in combination with RV dysfunction in cardiogenic shock might necessitate the introduction of a pressor agent plus treatment to reduce RV after-load, (FIG. 6c, d). Finally, in a patient with falling cardiac output levels despite escalating inotropic support, echocardiography can help to diagnose LV outflow tract obstruction (with or without associated mitral regurgitation). Treatment in this context involves reduction or cessation of positive inotropic agents, in combination with volume and pressor support.

Competency for quantitative echocardiographic monitoring — Because echocardiographic monitoring is used in varied clinical settings, the person using quantitative echocardiography must understand interobserver variability and have the technical expertise to ensure accurate serial measurements, and the interpretation and use of the quantitative parameters to guide therapeutic decision making should be done only by level II and III trained personnel; when used to guide therapeutic decision making, quantitative measurements require a minimum of level II training.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) imaging — monitoring medical therapy and surveillance: In obstructive HCM with persistent symptoms despite medical therapy, "repeat echocardiography to evaluate for the presence of a resting and/or provocable peak instantaneous LVOT gradient of ≥ 50 mm Hg is appropriate", and "If this gradient threshold is identified, discussion and shared decision-making with the patient regarding SRT is appropriate". For patients with reduced EF on guideline-directed therapy, "repeat echocardiography to evaluate for reverse remodeling and changes in LV filling and pulmonary artery pressures is reasonable". In stable patients without clinical change, "repeat TTE every 1 to 2 years is recommended". An "oral allosteric inhibitors of cardiac β-myosin" class is noted; for these agents, "monitoring of LVEF will be required", but "The frequency of examinations, and clinically relevant LVEF thresholds, remain to be determined".

Workflow, training, and safety — Patient flow within busy LVAD clinics may be streamlined by advance scheduling of routine surveillance examinations so that the appropriate time, exam room space, and adequately trained sonographers are available, either within a dedicated echocardiography laboratory or within a dedicated satellite laboratory in the HF/MCS center. When abnormalities are suspected, the type and extent of the examination can be more readily determined if the knowledgeable sonographer and echocardiographer are provided with a detailed indication for examination. In some cases, a limited confirmatory exam may be performed at the baseline pump speed, and a more detailed examination may be more appropriate after hospitalization. A new facet of examining LVAD patients is the need for arterial Doppler-derived BP measurement in many cases before starting the echocardiography exam to ensure safety and accurate interpretation when higher pump speed changes are included. In general, a primary goal is to provide a framework for incorporating echocardiography more efficiently into both routine follow-up and acute care of LVAD patients, with room for adaptation in the absence of validation and outcomes studies. However, adequately trained personnel, appropriate equipment, and quality-improvement measures are necessary because these cases are often complex and images can be difficult to acquire and interpret.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^11469QuY]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is the primary cause of hospital admission in > 1 million patients per year in the USA, with 25% of patients being readmitted within 1 month, and 10–20% mortality at 6 months after discharge. Acute heart failure (AHF) — either a new diagnosis in patients with no history of cardiac disease, or as a result of acute decompensation in patients with known heart failure — is the leading cause of hospital admission in individuals aged > 65 years in the UK. According to data from Europe, approximately 50% of these patients will be readmitted within 12 months, and 30% will be deceased at the 1-year follow-up. Despite numerous clinical trials to assess optimal treatment and management strategies for patients with AHF, little improvement has been made in AHF outcomes in the past 30 years, with management decisions largely based on expert consensus rather than robust evidence. The burden of AHF is therefore substantial, both to individual patients and to society. The successful management of patients with any acute condition involves early diagnosis, the identification of underlying reversible causes, and the implementation of effective therapies in a timely manner, all while avoiding harm; all these factors are associated with better in-hospital and short-term prognosis. This Consensus Statement, prepared by the Acute Heart Failure Study Group of the ESC Acute Cardiovascular Care Association, reviews the existing and potential roles of echocardiography and lung ultrasonography (LUS) in the assessment and management of patients with AHF.

Acute decompensated heart failure — E/e′ monitoring guidance states that the writing committee currently recommends that E/e′ not be used in monitoring LAP of patients with decompensated heart failure with depressed systolic function, noting that the primary focus of these studies was to use E/e′ to predict initial pressures, not on E/e′ as a monitoring tool, and that only small subsets of the study population had serial E/e′ measurements compared with serial changes in LAPs. In CHF, one evolving area in which echocardiographic guidance has become helpful is assessing responsiveness to LVAD therapy, with echocardiographic parameters used to serially monitor ramped interventions and determine whether patients can be weaned from LVAD therapy, and ramp protocols are defined as dynamic assessments.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), in partnership with the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and along with key specialty and subspecialty societies, conducted a review of common clinical scenarios where echocardiography is frequently considered. This document combines and updates the original transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography appropriateness criteria published in 2007 (1) and the original stress echocardiography appropriateness criteria published in 2008 (2). This revision reflects new clinical data, reflects changes in test utilization patterns, and clarifies echocardiography use where omissions or lack of clarity existed in the original criteria. The indications (clinical scenarios)were derived from common applications or anticipated uses, as well as from current clinical practice guidelines and results of studies examining the implementation of the original appropriate use criteria (AUC). The 202 indications in this document were developed by a diverse writing group and scored by a separate independent technical panel on a scale of 1 to 9, to designate appropriate use(median 7 to 9), uncertain use(median 4 to 6), and inappropriate use (median 1 to 3). Ninety-seven indications were rated as appropriate, 34 were rated as uncertain, and 71 were rated as inappropriate. In general, the use of echocardiography for initial diagnosis when there is a change in clinical status or when the results of the echocardiogram are anticipated to change patient management were rated appropriate. Routine testing when there was no change in clinical status or when results of testing were unlikely to modify management were more likely to be inappropriate than appropriate/uncertain. The AUC for echocardiography have the potential to impact physician decision making, healthcare delivery, and reimbursement policy. Furthermore, recognition of uncertain clinical scenarios facilitates identification of areas that would benefit from future research.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^1165hJVx]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2 Primary care physicians

Individuals with undetected HF exist and continue to grow within our communities. This is largely attributable to a high level of misdiagnosis, missed diagnoses, disparities in access to healthcare, and late presentations to healthcare providers (especially relevant during the COVID‐19 pandemic). Approximately one in six patients aged over 65 years presenting with breathlessness in primary care centres have unrecognized HF. Nearly 80% of all HF diagnoses are made following unscheduled hospitalizations despite 50% of patients having symptoms much earlier. The diagnosis of non‐acute HF in a primary care setting is notoriously difficult without echocardiography, especially in the early stages of HF. The universal definition recommends NT‐proBNP biomarker‐based screening to diagnose early stages of HF. Referrals for echocardiography may follow, as needed. Recent data from two large contemporary primary care studies of suspected HF showed that the NT‐proBNP cut‐off of 125 ng/L is diagnostically accurate in detecting new‐onset HF in a primary care setting. Primary care providers should be equipped to recognize patients in the early stages of HF (in the absence of symptoms) who need more proactive management to prevent and delay the onset of symptomatic HF in the future. How this is best achieved will need to be more fully explored from a research perspective and then articulated in expert clinical guidelines and reimbursement of coordinated activities of care.

4.3 Emergency and ambulatory care

Most patients presenting with acute HF are first evaluated and managed in emergency departments (EDs). Approximately one million annual ED visits in the United States are for acute HF, incurring nearly $39.2 billion in healthcare expenditure. Adjusting healthcare structures, systems, and processes in both ED setting and ambulatory care to promote the reach of the universal definition document will be required for effective implementation. Revision of medical record documentation will be necessary to capture the new definition, stages, and classification introduced. Accurate capture and linkage of clinical information during repeated visits will be key to understanding an individual's clinical trajectory.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^116gbwHB]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome, wherein patients experience signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF), with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%. It is estimated that at least 50% of patients with HF have HFpEF. Given its association with ageing and obesity, incidence and mortality rates are expected to rise over time, posing a significant problem for the healthcare system. The pathogenesis of HFpEF is multifactorial, and patients may present to different healthcare providers. Non-specific symptoms and signs, and variation in local pathways make diagnosis and management of patients challenging. Lack of awareness among healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding the pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria and treatment of HFpEF likely contributes to underdiagnosis. Variability in HF pathways and management disparities across the UK result in a significant number of patients being managed within primary care alone.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2018 chronic HF guidelines recommend an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) blood test for patients with suspected HF. If elevated, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and specialist assessment should follow. Echocardiography assesses systolic, diastolic, valvular and pericardial functions, crucial for diagnosing HF and excluding HF mimics. In patients with HFpEF, ejection fraction is not reduced, but other parameters such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) with elevated left ventricular filling pressures (LVFP) and left ventricular hypertrophy are variably found. Echocardiography can also identify possible underlying aetiologies, such as cardiac amyloidosis.

The British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) 2024 guidance recommends reporting terms that should describe the observed physiology and haemodynamics so that LVDF is reported as normal or abnormal, and if abnormal, whether LVFP are normal or elevated. For patients who describe symptoms of breathlessness with echocardiographic findings of LV diastolic impairment with elevated LVFP, LVEF ≥ 50%, no more than moderate left-sided valve disease, and no other identifiable cause of their symptoms, the following reporting statement is recommended to highlight the echocardiographic red flags: 'these findings may be consistent with HFpEF and should be considered in the context of clinical presentation and symptoms'.

However, despite the current BSE recommendations for the assessment of LVDF and cardiac amyloidosis, diastolic function analysis remains complex and the suspicion of HFpEF based on echocardiographic findings is rarely raised. This work sought to collate a consensus on echocardiographic reporting of suspected HFpEF in the UK and in the wider context of improving recognition and the referral process.

The 2013 (with updates in 2016 and 2017) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction although the evidence is substantially weaker. Management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

Early detection of structural abnormalities — Asymptomatic patients with ventricular dilatation and reduced LVEF carry substantially higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality than the general population. Limited information is available to support the cost-effectiveness of broad population screening, but brain natriuretic peptide levels represent a potential tool for this purpose. Certain patients are appropriate targets for more aggressive screening on the basis of characteristics that denote an increase in the risk for structural heart disease, and healthcare professionals should perform echocardiographic evaluation in selected patients without apparent structural heart disease who are at very high risk of a cardiomyopathy. Routine periodic assessment of LV function in other patients is not recommended.

### The role of echocardiography in heart failure [^113GfdMM]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Data from echocardiography provide a cornerstone in the management of heart failure. All imaging techniques can provide an ejection fraction, but the versatility of echocardiography makes it unique in the provision of volumes, diastolic function, right ventricular function, hemodynamics, and valvular regurgitation. The early detection of heart failure has been facilitated by the assessment of global longitudinal strain, which is also useful in later heart failure for the assessment of left ventricular synchrony. The use of echocardiography has been associated with favorable outcomes, probably on the basis of facilitation of appropriate therapy. This review examines the evidence provided by echocardiography and its application in specific settings. Although the guidelines emphasize that no single test satisfies all imaging requirements in heart failure, and other modalities can provide additional information about specific questions (especially tissue characterization), echocardiography is indispensable in the management of heart failure.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^116CSUZN]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography is increasingly recommended for the diagnosis and assessment of patients with severe cardiac disease, including acute heart failure. Although previously considered to be within the realm of cardiologists, the development of ultrasonography technology has led to the adoption of echocardiography by acute care clinicians across a range of specialties. Data from echocardiography and lung ultrasonography can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy, guide and monitor the response to interventions, and communicate important prognostic information in patients with acute heart failure. However, without the appropriate skills and a good understanding of ultrasonography, its wider application to the most acutely unwell patients can have substantial pitfalls. This Consensus Statement, prepared by the Acute Heart Failure Study Group of the ESC Acute Cardiovascular Care Association, reviews the existing and potential roles of echocardiography and lung ultrasonography in the assessment and management of patients with acute heart failure, highlighting the differences from established practice where relevant.

Noninvasive cardiac imaging recommendations — Class I: Patients with suspected or new-onset HF, or those presenting with acute decompensated HF, should undergo a chest x-ray to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary, and other diseases that may cause or contribute to the patient's symptoms (Level of Evidence: C). A 2-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler should be performed during initial evaluation of patients presenting with HF to assess ventricular function, size, wall thickness, wall motion, and valve function (Level of Evidence: C). Repeat measurement of EF and measurement of the severity of structural remodeling are useful to provide information in patients with HF who have had a significant change in clinical status; who have experienced or recovered from a clinical event; or who have received treatment, including GDMT, that might have had a significant effect on cardiac function; or who may be candidates for device therapy (Level of Evidence: C). Class IIa: Noninvasive imaging to detect myocardial ischemia and viability is reasonable in patients presenting with de novo HF, who have known CAD and no angina, unless the patient is not eligible for revascularization of any kind (Level of Evidence: C). Viability assessment is reasonable in select situations when planning revascularization in HF patients with CAD (Level of Evidence: B). Radionuclide ventriculography or magnetic resonance imaging can be useful to assess LVEF and volume when echocardiography is inadequate (Level of Evidence: C). Magnetic resonance imaging is reasonable when assessing myocardial infiltrative processes or scar burden (Level of Evidence: B). Class III: No Benefit — routine repeat measurement of LV function assessment in the absence of clinical status change or treatment interventions should not be performed (Level of Evidence: B).

### Recommendations for multimodality cardiac imaging in patients with Chagas disease: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the interAmerican association of echocardiography (ECOSIAC) and the cardiovascular imaging department of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology (DIC-SBC) [^115tA79S]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease — LV wall motion abnormalities, aneurysms, and thrombus prevalence are described with specific frequencies: In asymptomatic patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), wall motion abnormalities can be detected in up to 10% of patients, and as disease progresses to a dilated cardiomyopathy, the prevalence of regional abnormalities increases to approximately 50% of patients. LV apical aneurysms are found in 8.5% of asymptomatic patients, increasing to 55% (ranging from 47% to 64%) in patients with moderate or severe LV systolic dysfunction; at autopsy, 82% of aneurysms were at the LV apex, 9% in the right ventricle, and 9% in both ventricles. Mural thrombi can be associated with aneurysms, with the prevalence of LV thrombus in clinical studies approximately 20% and LV thrombosis in 35% to 44% of patients with Chagas heart disease (ChHD) who died of congestive HF or sudden cardiac death. An LV apical aneurysm is usually defined as a well-delineated dyskinetic area with marked wall thinning at the apex involving opposing walls and limited by an area of normal contraction.
