## Question

A 31-year-old male with bipolar disorder comes to the physician because of erectile dysfunction for the past month. He cannot maintain an erection during intercourse and rarely wakes up with an erection. He says he is happy in his current relationship, but admits to decreased desire for sex and feeling embarrassed about his sexual performance. He sustained a lumbar vertebral injury one year ago following a motor vehicle accident. He takes medication for his bipolar disorder but does not remember the name. Physical examination shows testicular atrophy with otherwise normal genitalia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A. Decreased testosterone levels
B. Peyronie disease
C. Microvascular disease
D. Psychologic stressors

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which is the most likely cause of erectile dysfunction in a 31-year-old man with bipolar disorder, decreased libido, rare morning erections, and testicular atrophy on exam, and to choose among decreased testosterone, Peyronie disease, microvascular disease, and psychologic stressors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the symptom cluster maps onto guideline-based etiologies of ED. Then, I should verify which physical finding is most discriminating. Next, I will weigh each option against the clinical data and guideline probabilities. Finally, I will confirm the single best answer and outline the immediate workup I would order to substantiate it.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. The triad of erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and reduced spontaneous or morning erections is classically associated with androgen deficiency syndromes, and guidelines emphasize that these sexual symptoms are the most specific for low testosterone among nonspecific complaints like fatigue or low mood, which strengthens the pretest probability of hypogonadism here [^114G25rR] [^114XKuPY].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the physical finding. Testicular atrophy on examination is a red flag for organic hypogonadism and is specifically highlighted as a sign warranting evaluation for testosterone deficiency; in contrast, psychogenic ED typically lacks objective genital abnormalities, so this atrophy materially shifts the balance toward an organic endocrine cause rather than a purely psychogenic one [^114XKuPY] [^113cLaYx].

> I will now examine the medication angle. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — SSRIs and other psychotropics can cause sexual dysfunction, but the presence of testicular atrophy points away from a purely iatrogenic psychogenic mechanism and toward concurrent organic hypogonadism; still, I should confirm the exact bipolar regimen and timing of symptom onset to avoid missing a drug effect superimposed on low testosterone [^113gAmE6] [^116FWNGy] [^114XKuPY].

> Next, I should review the alternatives. Peyronie disease would present with palpable plaque, penile curvature, and pain with erection, none of which are described here, making it unlikely as the primary cause in this case [^112vGjvA]. Microvascular disease is less plausible at age 31 without diabetes, hypertension, or smoking history, and the presence of testicular atrophy again argues against a purely vascular etiology; guidelines also note ED as a cardiovascular risk marker, but that linkage is stronger in older men with vascular risk profiles, not a 31-year-old with atrophic testes [^112g3TZu]. Psychological stressors can contribute, yet the objective atrophy and the sexual symptom triad make psychologic factors secondary rather than primary here [^116bhGKj].

> Let me synthesize. The combination of decreased libido, reduced morning erections, erectile dysfunction, and testicular atrophy in a young man fits an organic hypogonadal process most parsimoniously; guidelines advise measuring morning total testosterone in men with ED and sexual symptoms, and to repeat low values before confirming the diagnosis, which is exactly the next step I would take to substantiate decreased testosterone as the most likely cause [^1134ejSp] [^113ss2Ag] [^1124R92x].

> I should double-check the immediate workup. I would obtain a fasting morning total testosterone, with free testosterone or SHBG-based calculation if the total is borderline, and consider prolactin if libido is markedly low; I would also review the bipolar medication list carefully for agents that suppress the HPT axis and correlate symptom onset with medication changes, while planning management per contemporary ED and hypogonadism guidelines if testosterone deficiency is confirmed [^114mNUJU] [^112rBVkd] [^112qUU3o].

> Final answer: decreased testosterone levels. The clinical triad of low libido, reduced spontaneous erections, and ED plus the objective finding of testicular atrophy makes organic hypogonadism the most likely etiology in this 31-year-old, with psychologic and medication factors as potential contributors rather than primary causes [^114G25rR] [^111K8ekU] [^113cLaYx].

---

The most likely cause of erectile dysfunction in this 31-year-old male with bipolar disorder, decreased libido, rare morning erections, and testicular atrophy is **decreased testosterone levels** [^114G25rR]. This presentation is classic for **hypogonadism**, with low libido, reduced spontaneous erections, and testicular atrophy as key features [^114XKuPY]. Psychiatric medications (SSRIs, antipsychotics) and bipolar disorder itself can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, lowering testosterone and causing sexual dysfunction [^112Q4pSt] [^111K8ekU] [^116FWNGy]. Peyronie's disease and microvascular disease are less likely given the absence of penile deformity/pain and cardiovascular risk factors, respectively. Psychological stressors may contribute but are not the primary cause here [^116bhGKj]. Confirm with morning total testosterone and free testosterone, and treat with testosterone therapy if confirmed [^112qUU3o] [^114mNUJU] [^113ss2Ag] [^1117GZML].

---

## Clinical features supporting decreased testosterone levels

- **Decreased libido**: Strongly associated with low testosterone and is a hallmark of hypogonadism [^114G25rR].
- **Rare morning erections**: Reduced spontaneous erections are a classic sign of testosterone deficiency [^114XKuPY].
- **Testicular atrophy**: Objective evidence of hypogonadism, indicating reduced testosterone production [^114XKuPY].
- **Erectile dysfunction**: Common in hypogonadism and often improves with testosterone replacement [^1117GZML].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking bipolar disorder and decreased testosterone

Bipolar disorder and its treatments can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, reducing testosterone:

- **Psychiatric medications**: SSRIs, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers can suppress the HPG axis, lowering testosterone and causing sexual dysfunction [^113gAmE6].
- **Stress and depression**: Chronic stress and mood disturbances can dysregulate the HPG axis, reducing testosterone [^notfound].
- **Direct neuroendocrine effects**: Bipolar disorder may directly alter hypothalamic regulation of gonadotropins, lowering testosterone.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

To confirm hypogonadism, the following tests are recommended:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Morning total testosterone | Primary screening for hypogonadism [^1124R92x] |
| Free testosterone | Assess bioavailable testosterone [^114JxJcs] |
| LH and FSH | Differentiate primary vs secondary hypogonadism [^notfound] |
| Prolactin | Rule out hyperprolactinemia as a cause of hypogonadism [^111EbdnM] |

---

## Management strategies

If hypogonadism is confirmed, consider the following:

- **Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)**: Improves libido, erectile function, and overall quality of life in hypogonadal men [^1117GZML] [^116osqrf].
- **Addressing psychiatric medications**: Adjust or switch medications contributing to sexual dysfunction if feasible [^113gAmE6].
- **Psychological counseling**: Address performance anxiety and relationship issues to improve sexual function [^116bhGKj].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of erectile dysfunction in this patient is **decreased testosterone levels** due to bipolar disorder and its treatments. Confirm with morning testosterone testing and treat with TRT if low, alongside medication review and counseling.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

### Hormonal erectile dysfunction. evaluation and management [^113tp2o9]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism in the adult is difficult to establish on the basis of a history and physical examination and universally requires biochemical investigations. A serum testosterone determination is justified in men complaining of erectile dysfunction with or without alterations in sexual desire. Among the causes of erectile dysfunction, hypotestosteronemia rates are low. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction particularly is common at a period in life when alterations occur in male hormonal environment. The treatment of hypogonadal erectile dysfunction, regardless of age, is readily available, safe, and effective. The positive impact of treatment on the overall quality of life can be significant. The presence of erectile dysfunction in an aging man (> 55 years) does not imply the presence of hypogonadism, and, even if the two conditions are present, the indications for treatment require good clinical judgment. Persistent low testosterone levels may have significant detrimental effects in other organ systems; therefore, a timely diagnosis of androgen deficiency and appropriate treatment may have significant effects outside the narrow field of sexual performance.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disorder that has gained attention since the introduction of relatively safe treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. ED is a multi-factorial disorder and a common presentation for several systemic illnesses, particularly vascular occlusive diseases. The clinical evaluation of ED should be thorough and systematic, with attention to the appropriate use of sexual symptom questionnaires and symptom scales, detailed medical and sexual history, physical examination, and basic screening laboratory tests. Patients should be referred for specialized evaluations when appropriate. The clinician must be familiar with the pathophysiologic mechanisms of ED, its associations with other systemic diseases, the indications for specialist referrals, and the role of specialized testing to diagnose and treat this disorder effectively.

### Is increased libido an atypical symptom of bipolar depression? An interesting case [^1165QuLb]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Decreased libido is recognized as one of the vegetative symptoms of depression. Increased libido has not been acknowledged as one of its symptoms, neither has it been reported, particularly in depressed bipolar patients.

Aim

We hereby report a case of atypical presentation of increased sexual function in a patient in depressed phase of bipolar II thereby querying the fact, whether increased libido is actually an unrecognized atypical symptom of bipolar depression.

Methods

A 48-year-old male presented with mood swings whereby his sexual function was increased during his depressive phase. Antidepressant, mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic medication were administered. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was offered for augmentation therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

When sexual dysfunction is not identified, there is a risk of misdiagnosis and mismanagement.

Results

Patient did not attain full remission with medication. Compliance with medication was an issue, most probably due to the sexual side effects. The patient refused ECT.

Conclusion

This case highlights atypical presentation of high libido in a patient in the depressive phase of bipolar II disorder. The uncommon presentation of a common illness posed a diagnostic challenge and complicated the subsequent management. It was concluded that increased sexual function deserves further consideration as a symptom of bipolar depression.

### Venlafaxine [^1116GsMR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SNRIs, including venlafaxine tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In male patients, SNRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SNRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of venlafaxine tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder.

### Diagnosis and treatment of female sexual dysfunction [^117RaVoC]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Female sexual complaints are common, occurring in approximately 40 percent of women. Decreased desire is the most common complaint. Normal versus abnormal sexual functioning in women is poorly understood, although the concept of normal female sexual function continues to develop. A complete history combined with a physical examination is warranted for the evaluation of women with sexual complaints or concerns. Although laboratory evaluation is rarely helpful in guiding diagnosis or treatment, it may be indicated in women with abnormal physical examination findings or suspected comorbidities. The PLISSIT (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, Intensive Therapy) or ALLOW (Ask, Legitimize, Limitations, Open up, Work together) method can be used to facilitate discussions about sexual concerns and initiation of treatment. Developments in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction have led to investigation of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction. Although sexual therapy and education (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, individual and couple therapy, physiotherapy) form the basis of treatment, there is limited research demonstrating the benefit of hormonal and nonhormonal drugs. Testosterone improves sexual function in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, although data on its long-term safety and effectiveness are lacking. Estrogen improves dyspareunia associated with vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been shown to have limited benefit in small subsets of women with sexual dysfunction.

### Androgen deficiency in the etiology and treatment of erectile dysfunction [^113ADyG7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of erectile dysfunction (ED) has evolved dramatically following the introduction of oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Despite the limited role of directed diagnostic testing in the evaluation of the impotent patient, routine de-termination of a serum testosterone likely is indicated based on evidence that testosterone modulates erectile function, that hypogonadism is prevalent among elderly men and men with ED, and that symptomatology alone rarely detects hypogonadism. Forms of testosterone commonly used include oral, parenteral, transdermal, and implantable preparations, each with significant advantages and disadvantages. The risks and benefits of testosterone supplementation have been characterized incompletely and will require further validation before widespread use of testosterone as hormone replacement therapy in aging men.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The key findings from these clinical studies are that BAT (a) can be safely administered to asymptomatic patients with metastatic CRPC; (b) does not produce symptomatic disease progression; (c) produces sustained PSA and objective responses in 30‐40% of patients and (d) can resensitize and prolong response to subsequent antiandrogen therapy. Patients need to remember that BAT is not FDA‐approved therapy, does not work for everyone, and is not without risk. It is important for physicians not to overpromise results from BAT on quality of life and sexual function.

### Male hypogonadism. part II: etiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis [^112Q4pSt]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism has a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic conditions, anatomic abnormalities, infection, tumor, and injury. Defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may also result from type II diabetes mellitus and treatment with a range of medications. Circulating testosterone levels have been associated with sexual function, cognitive function, and body composition. Apart from reduced levels of testosterone, clinical hallmarks of hypogonadism include absence or regression of secondary sex characteristics, reduced fertility (oligospermia, azoospermia), anemia, muscle wasting, reduced bone mass (and bone mineral density), and/or abdominal adiposity. Some patients, particularly those with partial androgen deficiency of the aging male, also experience sexual dysfunction, reduced sense of vitality, depressed mood, increased irritability, difficulty concentrating, and/or hot flushes in certain cases of acute onset. As many patients with male hypogonadism-like patients with erectile dysfunction-do not seek medical attention, it is important for clinicians to be acquainted with the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, and to conduct appropriate laboratory testing and other assessments to determine the causes and inform the treatment of this condition.

AUA guideline — erectile dysfunction (ED) and low testosterone assessment states that ED is recognized as a symptom associated with low testosterone levels and clinicians are advised to measure total testosterone in all such patients. There does appear to be a trend towards lower total testosterone and a diagnosis of ED, and adjusted logistical regression analysis showed an inverse relationship between total testosterone and the presence of ED, with a probability of experiencing ED increasing as total testosterone levels decreased. However, after accounting for confounding variables, the study found that testosterone levels had no effect on the likelihood of having ED.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years. 1 Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1). 2 Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. 3 Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 Am. 4 Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method. 5 Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also indicated if there are symptoms of a sellar mass, serum LH is undetectable, or serum total testosterone is < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). 6 This includes optimization of management of chronic disease, stopping medications that can suppress the HPT axis if possible (eg, opioids, glucocorticoids), evaluation and treatment of depression and sleep apnea. 7 Consider karyotype for assessment for Klinefelter syndrome; offer testosterone treatment if there is no contraindication (including desire to conceive in the next 1–2 years). 8 The decision to offer testosterone therapy should take into consideration the likelihood of benefit and the potential risk. The benefits are highest in men with lower testosterone concentrations and men with concordantly low total and free testosterone concentrations. A trial of testosterone therapy may be offered if the following conditions are met: 1) there are no contraindications; 2) there has been a discussion regarding potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy and the uncertainties regarding long-term health outcomes; 3) patient-specific goals have been set; and 4) there is agreement that testosterone treatment will be stopped if these goals are not achieved. See text in manuscript. 9 Reassessment of men with high BMI consists of assessment for symptoms and signs of hypogonadism and re-measurement of testosterone. If there are symptoms of hypogonadism and low serum testosterone after 6–12 months of lifestyle changes, then testosterone therapy may be considered. Medical therapy to achieve weight loss and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for men whose BMI remains > 30 kg/m² after 6 months of lifestyle changes. Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FT, free testosterone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.

Thoughtful discussion of these issues with men and their partners is a key component of patient education and can promote acceptance of incorporating a mental health/sexuality expert into the treatment plan. Psychotherapy and psychosocial counseling focus on helping patients and their partners improve communication about sexual concerns, reducing anxiety related to entering and during a sexual situation, and introducing strategies for integrating ED treatments into their sexual relationship. For men with predominantly psychogenic ED, providers should offer a referral to a psychotherapist as either an alternative or adjunct to medical treatment to ED.

Patient evaluation and diagnosis of DO

Initial evaluation of a patient presenting with DO involves a thorough history and physical examination. This is the most important component of the patient's evaluation. Critical components of the history intake include medical, surgical, psychiatric, sexual, social, and religious history. Medical history should include conditions associated with neuropathy, metabolic derangements, or trauma; surgical history should include the history of neurologic and pelvic procedures. To date, no studies have identified an association between orgasmic dysfunction and recreational drug use, pornography use, or painful intercourse, but these still represent important components of the social history. Psychiatric history should delve into any stressors at home or work, history of infertility, sexual abuse or trauma, repressive sexual education or religious beliefs, and history of being widowed or divorced.

Questioning regarding onset and duration of DO can also enable the clinician to decipher between lifelong/primary versus acquired/secondary DO and generalized versus situational DO. The patient's medication list should also be reviewed.

General physical examination is also performed to evaluate for any confounding organic conditions including metabolic disorders (obesity), decreased serum T (minimal body hair, muscular atrophy), and prior injuries (scars). Genitourinary examination should assess for undescended or solitary testicle as well as testicular atrophy.

Hormonal evaluation serves as the basis for laboratory testing when evaluating a patient with DO. The mainstay of hormonal laboratory testing is total and calculated bioavailable/free T, TSH, vitamin D, estradiol, and PRL. Baseline labs such as a basic metabolic panel (BMP), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, Hemoglobin A1c may also be assessed to evaluate for other underlying abnormalities as indicated by the patient's history.

Adjunctive testing includes biothesiometry or pudendal somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) to evaluate for loss of penile sensitivity, sympathetic skin testing to assess sympathetic efferent flow to genital skin, and sacral reflex art testing to examine the motor and sensory branches of the pudendal nerves and the S2–4 nerve roots. However, adjunctive testing is not routinely clinically indicated.

A proposed algorithm summarizing the evaluation of patients presenting with DO/AO is summarized in Fig. 1.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^116wZ9R6]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion — erectile dysfunction (ED) in the male partner during infertility evaluation: It is the responsibility of the clinician to assess for the presence of erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, or diminished libido in men presenting for evaluation of infertility, and referral to a reproductive urologist or other appropriate specialist is often warranted. ED is prevalent and increases with age; severe and moderate-severity ED occur in 5% and 17%, respectively, of men aged 40–49 years. Globally, more than 152 million men were reported to have ED in 1995, with projections to 322 million in 2025. Among men with infertility, ED is present in 18%–89%, and the prevalence of ED in infertile men is significantly higher than in fertile controls. Men with ED without a history of cardiovascular disease have a 45% increased risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event within 5 years compared with those without ED. In infertility care, ED can be psychogenic or organic; psychogenic ED occurs when a man has normal penile blood flow and nerve function and may achieve an erection under some circumstances but typically not with his partner when trying to conceive, whereas organic ED is commonly a result of diminished penile blood flow or nerve dysfunction and results in the inability to achieve or maintain an erection regardless of the situation.

### Testosterone therapy improves erectile function and libido in hypogonadal men [^112d7AY1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Erectile dysfunction and decreased libido are common complaints in the older male population. Recent studies have elucidated the role testosterone therapy (TTh) can play in men with low testosterone levels. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of these findings and the utility of TTh. We specifically examine the role of TTh on erectile function, coadministration with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and libido.

Recent Findings

Recent publications suggest that TTh improves mild erectile dysfunction, though may be less useful in men with more severe erectile dysfunction. In men unresponsive to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and with mild erectile dysfunction, TTh can further improve erectile function. TTh has also shown consistent benefit in improving libido in men with low testosterone levels at baseline, with no additional improvements once testosterone levels are normalized.

Summary

The available literature supports a role for TTh in men with low testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction, and low libido, with symptomatic improvement in these men.

The Case

A 67-year-old man is referred for evaluation and management of possible hypogonadism.

His genital exam is normal (including testes that measure 20 cc each by Prader orchidometry). Pedal pulses are reduced. The remainder of the exam is normal, including cardiopulmonary, abdominal, skin, and neurological exam is normal.

Results from tests ordered by his primary care provider and performed on a nonfasting afternoon blood sample drawn 8 weeks ago demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 138.3 ng/dL (4.9 nmol/L) (normal range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L), a serum HbA1c of 8.1% and a serum hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL (normal range, 13.5–17.5 g/dL). Liver function and kidney function tests were normal. Bone densitometry 6 months ago revealed a T score of −1.8 in the lumbar spine and −1.6 in the left total hip and femoral neck.

### Sexual dysfunction and depression [^115QURGB]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Sexual functioning is generally impaired during depression. Interest in the relationship between sexual dysfunction and depression has risen substantially, prompted primarily by 1) the 1998 Food and Drug Administration approval of sildenafil citrate as the first oral therapy of erectile dysfunction, and 2) the widespread clinical use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which prominently impair orgasm, and possibly libido and arousal. In this paper, we first review the phenomenology of sexual dysfunction and important contributing factors, such as age and illness, and then focus on the clinical assessment and therapeutic interventions used for sexual dysfunction in depressed individuals.

### Sexual dysfunction due to psychotropic medications [^113gAmE6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Sexual functioning is important to assess in patients with psychiatric illness as both the condition and associated treatment may contribute to sexual dysfunction (SD). Antidepressant medications, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antianxiety agents may be associated with SD related to drug mechanism of action. Sexual adverse effects may be related to genetic risk factors, impact on neurotransmitters and hormones, and psychological elements. Effective strategies to manage medication-induced sexual dysfunction are initial choice of a drug unlikely to cause SD, switching to a different medication, and adding an antidote to reverse SD. Appropriate interventions should be determined on a clinical case-by-case basis.
