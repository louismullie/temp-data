## Question

workup for RA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step diagnostic workup for suspected rheumatoid arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect RA and how to structure the initial history and physical examination. Then, I should verify the first-line laboratory tests and their limitations. Next, I will review imaging choices and their roles in early disease. After that, I need to apply the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria appropriately and consider early referral thresholds. Then, I should confirm pretreatment infection screening and cardiovascular risk assessment. Finally, I will address special scenarios like seronegative disease, difficult-to-treat RA, and monitoring cadence, and I will close with a concise diagnostic algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical triggers for suspicion of RA, because I need to ensure we do not miss early inflammatory arthritis. The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria are intended for patients with at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis not better explained by another disease, so I should anchor on that before ordering tests, and I should also remember that RA is primarily a clinical diagnosis with no single definitive test, which means my threshold to suspect RA should be low when there is persistent inflammatory polyarthritis or small-joint involvement with morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes [^112qeuM5] [^1123cHWZ] [^115555DC] [^116Q3BA4].

> Wait, let me verify the key elements of the history and physical that meaningfully narrow the differential. I need to check for symmetric small-joint involvement, prolonged morning stiffness, systemic features, and symptom duration, and I should actively exclude mimics such as psoriatic arthritis, lupus, gout, and osteoarthritis by asking about psoriasis, oral ulcers, dactylitis, crystal history, and mechanical pain patterns, because misclassification is a known pitfall when relying on serology alone or applying classification tools prematurely [^1124uUZ4] [^114pobUv] [^113PGXe6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about seronegative disease; I should confirm that RF and anti-CCP are supportive but not diagnostic. I will now examine the first-line laboratory panel: RF, anti-CCP, ESR, and CRP, recognizing that anti-CCP has higher specificity than RF and that a substantial minority of true RA patients are seronegative, so negative serology does not exclude RA and should not delay referral if clinical suspicion is high [^116195D1] [^114phRLv] [^114QUTZU].

> I need to ensure imaging is used judiciously and in the right sequence. Conventional radiography of hands and feet is reasonable to establish a baseline and look for characteristic distribution or erosions, but I should double-check expectations because early erosive disease is uncommon and routine radiographs rarely change diagnostic classification in newly presenting arthritis, so a normal film does not exclude RA and should not delay treatment decisions when clinical suspicion is strong [^117ThNf6] [^111tHSQ6]. Let me consider ultrasound next; musculoskeletal ultrasound can detect synovitis and power Doppler signal even when joints are not obviously swollen, and it can be particularly helpful in seronegative patients or when the exam is limited by obesity, though I should confirm that its role is adjunctive rather than standalone diagnostic [^112UMgqu] [^1124uUZ4] [^116Q3BA4]. MRI is highly sensitive for synovitis and bone marrow edema and can reveal early erosions, but I should verify that it is reserved for complex cases or when ultrasound is unavailable or nondiagnostic, given cost and access constraints [^1124uUZ4].

> Next, I should review how to apply the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, and I must be careful not to overstate their purpose. These criteria are designed for classification, not diagnosis, and they require at least one clinically swollen joint not better explained by another disease; they weight joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration, with a score of 6 or more supporting classification, but I should confirm that indiscriminate use risks overtreatment and that clinical judgment remains paramount [^112qeuM5] [^115Umhze] [^113PGXe6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the criteria mandate a minimum of two small joints involved, but I should correct that; the scoring assigns higher points for more joints and distinguishes small from large joints, yet a single small joint with synovitis can contribute points and, with serology and duration, reach the threshold, so I need to ensure I am applying the actual scoring weights rather than a misremembered rule [^115Umhze].

> I should confirm early referral thresholds because delays worsen outcomes. If there are three or more swollen joints, MCP/MTP involvement, or morning stiffness beyond 30 minutes, rapid referral to rheumatology is advised, and in undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, clinical prediction tools like the Leiden rule can help stratify risk and expedite referral, aligning with the principle that early DMARD initiation within 3 months of symptom onset improves long-term outcomes [^115555DC] [^112vfWzV] [^115tsEiB].

> Before initiating DMARDs, I need to check mandatory infection screening to avoid preventable harm. I should double-check that EULAR recommends screening for latent tuberculosis with chest radiography and IGRA, screening for HBV in all patients, considering HCV screening in those with risk factors or elevated ALT, and screening for HIV prior to biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs, with consideration before conventional DMARDs or prolonged steroids, and I should align with national protocols for LTBI treatment if indicated [^113idHpZ] [^112k1UUe] [^116SeQKu] [^114Y1aSp].

> Let me consider cardiovascular risk because RA confers excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. I should confirm that baseline cardiovascular risk assessment and aggressive risk factor modification are recommended in RA care, as CVD is the leading cause of death in this population, and this should be integrated early alongside inflammatory disease management [^116GV1HK].

> But wait, what if the patient is seronegative with convincing synovitis; I should not dismiss the diagnosis. Seronegative RA accounts for a meaningful proportion of cases and may carry different comorbidity profiles and treatment responses, so I need to ensure that imaging evidence of synovitis, particularly with ultrasound or MRI, supports the diagnosis and that I avoid anchoring bias from negative serology [^114QUTZU] [^112UMgqu].

> I will now examine the scenario of difficult-to-treat RA, where persistent symptoms may reflect inflammation, noninflammatory comorbidities, or both. I should confirm that EULAR emphasizes establishing the presence or absence of active inflammation before escalating therapy, and that ultrasound can help adjudicate inflammatory activity when clinical assessment is confounded by obesity or fibromyalgia, guiding whether to intensify DMARDs or pivot to noninflammatory management strategies [^113jsUCX] [^114km4RM].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence once therapy begins, because treat-to-target care hinges on timely adjustments. I need to ensure active disease is reassessed every 1 to 3 months and therapy is adjusted if there is no improvement by 3 months or the target is not reached by 6 months, with shared decision-making guiding escalation choices and remission or low disease activity maintained for at least 6 months before tapering is considered [^115e1gxa] [^112g8HL5].

> Let me reconsider the overall diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency and completeness. Suspect RA in patients with persistent inflammatory polyarthritis or small-joint synovitis, confirm inflammatory features on exam, obtain RF, anti-CCP, ESR, and CRP recognizing seronegativity is common, use baseline hand and foot radiographs judiciously while leveraging ultrasound or MRI when diagnosis is uncertain or seronegative, apply the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria only for classification support after excluding mimics, refer early to rheumatology when red flags are present, complete infection screening before immunosuppression, and address cardiovascular risk, all while remembering that RA remains a clinical diagnosis and that early DMARD initiation within 3 months of symptom onset is the cornerstone of preventing irreversible damage [^115tsEiB] [^1123cHWZ] [^112qeuM5] [^117ThNf6] [^112UMgqu] [^115555DC] [^113idHpZ] [^116GV1HK].

---

The workup for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) centers on **clinical assessment** to identify persistent synovitis and exclude mimics, followed by **serologic testing** (RF, anti-CCP) and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) to support the diagnosis and gauge activity [^1123cHWZ]. Imaging starts with **plain radiographs** of hands/feet to establish baseline and detect erosions; ultrasound or MRI is added when early disease or soft-tissue involvement is suspected [^117ThNf6] [^112UMgqu]. Synovial fluid analysis is used when infection or crystals are a concern. Apply the **2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria** to guide diagnosis and urgency of therapy, and complete pretreatment infection screening (TB, HBV, HCV, HIV) before DMARDs [^112qeuM5] [^113idHpZ] [^112k1UUe] [^114Y1aSp]. Early, structured evaluation enables timely DMARD initiation and improves outcomes [^115JT95N].

---

## Clinical assessment

### History

- **Symptom duration**: Persistent joint symptoms ≥ 6 weeks [^115Umhze].
- **Joint involvement**: Symmetric small joint involvement (MCP, PIP, wrists) is typical [^112y78mE].
- **Morning stiffness**: Prolonged (> 30 minutes) suggests inflammatory arthritis [^115555DC].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss [^notfound].
- **Family history**: RA or other autoimmune diseases [^113CCNBH].
- **Exclusions**: Identify alternative diagnoses (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, lupus, gout, osteoarthritis) [^114pobUv].

---

### Physical examination

On examination, **joint assessment** should document swelling, tenderness, warmth, and limited range of motion, with attention to symmetric small-joint involvement [^115jkF8m]. Extra-articular features to assess include rheumatoid nodules, ocular inflammation, pulmonary or cardiac involvement, and cutaneous manifestations [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory tests

### Serologic tests

| **Test** | **Clinical significance** | **Diagnostic performance** |
|-|-|-|
| Rheumatoid factor (RF) | Autoantibody against IgG Fc; present in ~70–90% of RA | Sensitivity 70–90%, specificity 70–85% [^notfound] |
| Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) | Highly specific for RA; associated with erosive disease | Sensitivity 50–75%, specificity 95–99% [^116195D1] |
| Antinuclear antibody (ANA) | Screen for autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE) | Low specificity for RA; useful for differential diagnosis [^notfound] |

---

### Inflammatory markers

For inflammatory markers, **erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)** and **C-reactive protein (CRP)** reflect inflammation and help monitor disease activity; however, they are nonspecific and may be normal in early or mild disease [^114phRLv].

---

### Complete blood count (CBC)

For the complete blood count, **anemia of chronic disease** is common, and thrombocytosis may correlate with disease activity [^notfound].

---

### Additional laboratory tests

Additional laboratory tests include **liver and renal function tests** to establish baseline organ function before DMARDs, and **urinalysis** to screen for renal involvement or urinary abnormalities [^112vfWzV].

---

## Imaging studies

### Plain radiography

Obtain baseline **hand and foot radiographs** to assess erosions, joint space narrowing, and osteopenia; early disease may show no abnormalities [^117ThNf6] [^112njHt2].

---

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound detects **synovitis, joint effusions, and erosions** and is more sensitive than clinical examination, particularly in early disease [^112UMgqu].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI is highly sensitive for **early synovitis, bone marrow edema, and erosions** and is useful when radiographs are normal but suspicion remains high [^112UMgqu].

---

## Synovial fluid analysis

Perform **synovial fluid analysis** when infection or crystal arthritis is suspected; in RA, fluid is inflammatory (WBC 2,000–50,000/mm³), Gram stain and culture are negative, and crystals are absent [^114gueHy].

---

## Classification criteria

Use the **2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria**, which require ≥ 1 joint with definite clinical synovitis not better explained by another disease and combine joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration (score ≥ 6/10 classifies RA) [^115Umhze].

---

## Pretreatment screening

Before initiating DMARDs, perform **pretreatment screening** for latent tuberculosis (chest radiograph, IGRA), hepatitis B and C, and HIV to guide safe immunosuppressive therapy [^113idHpZ] [^112k1UUe] [^114Y1aSp].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** includes psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, gout, pseudogout, osteoarthritis, and infectious arthritis; careful clinical assessment and targeted testing help distinguish these entities [^114pobUv].

---

## Summary of RA workup

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical assessment | Identify synovitis, exclude mimics |
| 2 | Serology (RF, anti-CCP) | Confirm diagnosis, assess prognosis |
| 3 | Inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) | Assess activity, monitor response |
| 4 | Imaging (radiographs, ultrasound, MRI) | Detect erosions, synovitis, monitor progression |
| 5 | Synovial fluid analysis | Exclude infection/crystals |
| 6 | Classification criteria | Standardize diagnosis, guide therapy |
| 7 | Pretreatment screening | Ensure safe DMARD initiation |

---

A structured workup — clinical assessment, serology, imaging, and targeted tests — enables **early, accurate RA diagnosis** and timely DMARD initiation, improving outcomes [^115JT95N].

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^115GbdTR]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Disease activity and response to treatment are usually assessed by clinical criteria and blood tests. For straightforward cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatologist might therefore not need much or any imaging input.

Imaging is, however, required for all cases that are not straightforward. Patients presenting with fairly non-specific aches, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory disease, might be early presentations of these disorders, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disorders. As early diagnosis results in far better long-term outcomes, a wait and see approach is no longer acceptable.

The questions asked of the radiologist in these cases are typically some or all of these.

Is there inflammation? Which joint or organ is affected? What is the anatomical pattern of involvement?

### Diagnosing early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). What are the problems and opportunities? [^115pGL2Y]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis is being appropriately emphasized in RA, as early DMARD treatment can be very effective. ACR criteria are useful but may not perform as well in early disease. These criteria depend on clinical examination, which is subject to over- and under-interpretation. Ultrasound and MRI may offer advantages. Laboratory tests and synovial fluid analyses may contribute, but are often not definitive. All of these data, synovial biopsies and a variety of other features can guide prognosis as well as diagnosis. Consideration of the whole patient, including education levels and coping strategies, can help. Aggressive management is proposed for most patients once the diagnosis is firm. Strategies are needed to arrange that patients are seen at a very early stage by rheumatologists knowledgeable in the treatment of early arthritis. Early diagnosis is receiving increasing emphasis in RA, with the recognition that erosive irreversible disease can occur in the first months and that a variety of treatments can clearly prevent or slow disease progression (1, 2). Most studies addressing early RA use the American Rheumatism Association (ARA), now the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), criteria (3) for purposes of uniformity although these criteria have been shown to be less valid in early disease (4). Early DMARD treatment can make a difference, but there are a number of unanswered or partially answered questions about diagnosis that remain to be addressed. We review this area, focusing on work from our own research and how this has guided our thinking.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^115tsEiB]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

RA has a substantial impact on both patients and healthcare systems. Our objective is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the condition's diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists formulated contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations concerning both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were documented, leading to research recommendations.

Results

A fundamental concept governing treatment of RA is minimization of cumulative inflammation, referred to as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core principles of management were identified: (i) detect and refer patients early, even if the diagnosis is uncertain: patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis and rheumatology departments should provide rapid access to a diagnostic and prognostic service; (ii) treat RA immediately: optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires that effective treatment be started early-ideally within 3 months of symptom onset; (iii) tight control of inflammation in RA improves outcome: frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low-disease activity/remission at an agreed target; (iv) consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment to each patient: differing patient, disease and drug characteristics require long-term monitoring of risks and benefits with adaptations of treatments to suit individual circumstances.

Conclusion

These principles focus on effective control of the inflammatory process in RA, but optimal uptake may require changes in service provision to accommodate appropriate care pathways.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^1123Z5Ud]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection of studies

First, titles and abstracts were screened in duplicate by the fellows (NMTR and MK) according to a set list of selection criteria (online supplemental file) until the percentage of conflicts was below 5%. In case of conflicts or when in doubt, eligibility was discussed with the comethodologist (PMJW). Second, all full text versions of the selected papers were screened in duplicate by the fellows (NMTR and MK). Disagreements were discussed with the comethodologist (PMJW) until consensus was reached.

As specific evidence on D2T RA patients was expected to be scarce, we decided not to focus on D2T RA patients only, but on a broader population of RA patients. Regarding the diagnosis of RA and relevant differential diagnoses, papers were eligible when focusing on patients clinically diagnosed with RA and suspected of a mimicking disease, patients suspected of RA according to the classification criteria in whom a new diagnostic test was evaluated, or patients suspected of RA, but not satisfying classification criteria. Regarding the assessment of inflammatory activity, we decided to only exclude papers when the study population included treatment naïve RA patients. Additionally, in this population, diagnostic tests beyond currently used reference standards had to be evaluated.

Key messages

Ascertaining the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the inflammatory origin of the complaints are important in the management of difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA.
This systematic literature review, conducted to inform the EULAR recommendations for the management of D2T RA, provides an extensive overview of the current literature regarding diagnostic issues in D2T RA.
The identified evidence had several limitations: (1) study population could not be considered as having D2T RA; (2) typically no appropriate diagnostic association measures were reported; (3) heterogeneous and suboptimal reference standards were used and (4) most studies (thus) had a moderate to high risk of bias.
No diagnostic tests with sufficient validity and accuracy were found to confirm nor exclude the diagnosis of RA nor its mimicking diseases in D2T RA patients.
Despite the lack of high-quality direct evidence, ultrasonography may have an additional value to traditional clinical assessment to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients, including those with concomitant obesity or fibromyalgia.

### Early referral recommendation for newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis: evidence based development of a clinical guide [^115555DC]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requires early diagnosis and early disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment to have an impact on long term morbidity and mortality. Clinical criteria would facilitate early referral of the patient with suspected RA to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and initiation of DMARD treatment at that point in the disease most likely to have an impact on the long term outcome.

Objective

To develop a referral recommendation that may serve as a clinical guide for primary care doctors, enabling them to identify patients with suspected RA during the early inflammatory stages.

Methods

Key points of the referral criteria were formed based on a thorough literature review targeting early RA, early arthritis clinics, DMARD treatment for early RA, prognostic factors of disease progression, early RA clinical trials, and quality of life. Evidence was graded using the methods defined by Shekelle et al. A draft version of the criterion was circulated among the authors for critical evaluation. A consensus integrated these comments.

Results

Clinical evidence strongly supports the observations that structural damage occurs early in active RA and that early DMARD treatment improves the long term outcome of the disease. The observations indicate that rapid referral to a rheumatologist is advised when RA is suspected. This may be supported by the presence of any of the following: ≥ 3 swollen joints, metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal involvement, and morning stiffness of ≥ 30 minutes.

Conclusion

The proposed early referral recommendation is a viable tool for primary care doctors to identify potential patients with active RA early in the disease. Early referral to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and early DMARD treatment should improve the long term outcome of RA.

The aim of this SLR was first to explore and summarise how to optimally confirm the diagnosis of RA in a D2T RA patient and how to optimally diagnose and rule out alternative or coexisting mimicking diseases. In addition, this SLR focused on the assessment of the presence of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients and in those with comorbidities that may influence this assessment. This SLR, together with the other SLR focusing on therapeutic strategies in D2T RA, was conducted to inform the EULAR recommendations for the management of D2T RA.

Study characteristics

The first search regarding the diagnosis of RA and relevant differential diagnoses yielded 2111 unique papers. Title and abstract screening resulted in 337 papers, which were fully reviewed. Four of them fulfilled the selection criteria and were included for data extraction (figure 1A). One additional paper was included via the search on the assessment of inflammatory activity as this paper focused on the diagnosis of RA. Of these five papers, one paper regarded the optimal confirmation of a diagnosis of RAand four papers the confirmation of a coexisting mimicking disease in patients with RA.

(B) The assessment of inflammatory activity in (2a) RA patients, and (2b) RA patients with comorbidities that might influence the assessment. RA, rheumatoid arthritis; SLR, systematic literature review.

The second search on the assessment of inflammatory disease activity resulted in 3858 unique papers. After title and abstract screening, 237 papers were selected for full-text screening and 45 papers were selected for inclusion. Additionally, 32 papers were selected via reference screening (figure 1B). Seventy of 77 papers were selected for the assessment of inflammatory activity in general, the seven remaining papers studied the assessment of inflammatory activity in patients with RA with specific comorbidities.

Heterogeneity in diagnostic tests, diagnostic association measures and reference standards used prohibited pooling the data in an appropriate way. The majority of studies regarding the assessment of inflammatory activity reported correlations only, instead of the preferred diagnostic association measures (ie, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LRs or ORs). All quantitative information on diagnostic tests is summarised in online supplemental tables 1–5.

Most studies were found to have a moderate or high RoB. For confirmation of the diagnosis of RA, predominantly because the cut-off for the optimal sensitivity and specificity was selected by using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the data of the same patient cohorts (ie, no predefined cut-off). For assessment of inflammatory activity, predominantly because the reference standard used was not optimal. The patient flow and timing of index test vs reference standard were generally described clearly and were appropriate in most studies.

Overall concerns about applicability for the majority of studies were moderate or high, mainly since the patient populations of included studies did not contain (D2T) RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the diagnosis of RA or the presence of inflammatory activity (RoB assessment and concerns regarding applicability per paper in online supplemental tables 1–5).

### Rheumatoid arthritis: early diagnosis and treatment [^112y78mE]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disorder that manifests as a symmetric polyarthritis of small and large joints that may lead to joint and periarticular structural damage and the consequences of systemic inflammation. This overview of early RA examines the unmet needs and challenges in RA, how to best diagnose RA, and pitfalls in early diagnosis and treatment. The rules for referral to a rheumatologist are reviewed. Primary care physicians are at the front line of early diagnosis and need to start disease-modifying therapy as soon as a diagnosis of RA is established.

INTRODUCTION

Treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have largely expanded and treatment strategies have improved over the past decades. Nowadays, many patients reach remission or low disease activity when following the current EULAR recommendations and/or American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the management of RA. However, there is still a substantial proportion of RA patients that remains symptomatic even though they have been treated according to these recommendations. This patient group is referred to as having 'difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA'. This disease state is expected to affect 5%–20% of all patients with RA, depending on the specific definition used.D2T RA has recently been defined as patients who failed at least two biological/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) with different mechanisms of action after failing conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD therapy. Additionally, patients should have signs and/or symptoms suggestive of active disease, which is perceived as problematic by the patient and/or rheumatologist. The unmet need for these patients was previously underlined by an international survey that was conducted among rheumatologists. Consequently, the importance has been acknowledged by EULAR with the approval of a Task Force on the development of management recommendations for D2T RA.

In D2T RA patients, DMARD therapy is frequently changed in routine daily practice in case of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of active disease. However, D2T RA is a heterogeneous disease state and various factors could contribute to the persistence of these signs and/or symptoms: factors related to inflammation (eg, having underlying immunological disease mechanisms driving 'true' refractory disease or treatment non-adherence), factors of non-inflammatory origin (eg, concomitant fibromyalgia) or both. All these contributing factors may require different pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, which are reviewed in a separate systematic literature review (SLR).

Importantly, intensification or other changes in DMARD therapy to reduce inflammation may only be appropriate in patients with insufficient response to therapy due to inflammatory RA activity. Symptoms of other diseases, for example, psoriatic arthritis and polyarticular gouty arthritis, may mimic RA possibly leading to misdiagnosis of the disease. Additionally, coexistence of certain circumstances, for example, obesity, pain syndromes and osteoarthritis, may hamper proper grading of disease activity by influencing diagnostic measures. Therefore, in D2T RA, it will be important to ascertain the diagnosis of RA and the presence of inflammatory RA activity before adjusting therapeutic strategies.

### The new European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how are they performing? [^113PGXe6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This era of early aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) calls for criteria that allow timely classification of patients at risk of persistent erosive disease. We review how the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria meet up to this challenge.

Recent Findings

The new 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed using initiation of methotrexate as anchor in a population with undifferentiated arthritis. Many studies from different countries have now been published that have addressed the performances of these new criteria.

Summary

The goal of earlier classification of RA seems to be met with the new criteria, but exclusion of other diagnoses is essential. Increased sensitivity comes at the price of loss of specificity and indiscriminate use of these classification criteria as a diagnostic tool carries the risk of overtreatment.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1124uUZ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation. A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### The ability of rheumatologists blinded to prior workup to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis only by clinical assessment: a cross-sectional study [^111SQgwx]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to study the ability of board-certified rheumatologists, blinded to all prior diagnostic test results, to establish the presence/absence of an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD) or RA among polyarthralgia or arthritis patients, solely relying on clinical assessment.

Methods

We performed a prospective, examiner-blinded, cross-sectional study documenting the diagnostic work in four sequential steps (medical history, physical examination, musculoskeletal ultrasonography and laboratory tests) of board-certified rheumatologists in a convenience cohort of 100 patients referred for inpatient diagnostic workup to a tertiary care rheumatology centre.

Results

The ability to correctly identify patients with or without an IRD (diagnostic accuracy) increased from 27% after the clinical assessment to 53% after the ultrasonography and to 70% after taking laboratory test results into account. The corresponding values for correctly identifying patients with or without RA were 19, 42 and 60%, respectively. Therefore the diagnostic accuracy of solely clinical assessment for determining the diagnosis of IRD or RA compared with the diagnosis established by a consecutive thorough in-patient workup was only 27 and 19% in our cohort, respectively. Pretreatment with corticosteroids (in the prior 7 days) vs none did not alter these results substantially (20 vs 29% for IRD, 15% vs 20% for RA).

Conclusion

Experienced rheumatologists, if deprived of information on prior external imaging and laboratory workup by blinding, were not able to correctly classify the majority of patients presenting with polyarthralgia or arthritis symptoms for inpatient workup, relying only on a brief symptom-focused medical history and physical examination.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^117AaVvB]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

As 'best available direct evidence' to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the presence of inflammatory activity, only one study was identified, having a moderate RoB. In this study, only weak and statistically non-significant correlations were reported between an US sum score and DAS28. In the general population of RA patients who are not treatment naïve, US was studied most extensively among all diagnostic tests in papers with low to moderate RoB. All papers reported moderate to strong correlations between DAS28 and US sum scores, although also here appropriate diagnostic association measures were not reported. These moderate to strong correlations in the general RA population together with the absence of at least a moderate correlation in patients in whom there is explicit doubt about the presence of inflammatory activity (and thus in in whom traditional measures may not be trusted), suggest that US may have an additional value in these patients. However, the optimal number of joints to include in an US sum score to assess inflammatory activity at patient level differed per study and is currently unclear. This limitation hampers the current use of an US sum score in clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^1123cHWZ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of multisystem comorbidities. Prevalence is estimated to be 0.8 percent worldwide, with women twice as likely to develop the disease as men. Untreated, 20 to 30 percent of persons with rheumatoid arthritis become permanently work-disabled within two to three years of diagnosis. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in pathogenesis. Although laboratory testing and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis and track disease progress, rheumatoid arthritis primarily is a clinical diagnosis and no single laboratory test is diagnostic. Complications of rheumatoid arthritis may begin to develop within months of presentation; therefore, early referral to or consultation with a rheumatologist for initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended. Several promising new disease-modifying drugs recently have become available, including leflunomide, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and anakinra. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and nonpharmacologic modalities also are useful. Patients who do not respond well to a single disease-modifying drug may be candidates for combination therapy. Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disease, although patients can go into remission. Physicians must be aware of common comorbidities. Progression of rheumatoid arthritis is monitored according to American College of Rheumatology criteria based on changes in specific symptoms and laboratory findings. Predictors of poor outcomes in early stages of rheumatoid arthritis include low functional score early in the disease, lower socioeconomic status, early involvement of many joints, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level at disease onset, positive rheumatoid factor, and early radiologic changes.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116Q3BA4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practices, early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops to established RA in the future is sometimes difficult. In contrast to a few patients with inflammatory arthritis who may undergo spontaneous remission and some who may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients have moderate to high disease activity and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments that would be more effective in the diagnosis of early disease are needed. Although RA is a clinical diagnosis and has no specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most important parameters for diagnosis and for identification of at risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and together with acute phase reactants were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria of RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve the diagnosis of RA. Several novel autoantigens and antibodies that may improve early diagnosis and predict further development of the disease have been recently identified. Besides clinical signs and serological tests, imaging techniques, particularly ultrasound, may improve early diagnosis of RA, particularly in seronegative patients.

In this commentary, we will attempt to summarize the role of ultrasound and several serological biomarkers, which are currently studied in order to serve as surrogate measures for RA diagnosis.

### Laboratory tests to assess patients with rheumatoid arthritis: advantages and limitations [^114phRLv]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests provide the most definitive information for diagnosing and managing many diseases, and most patients look to laboratory tests as the most important information from a medical visit. Most patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). More than 30% 40% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies or a normal ESR or CRP. More than 30% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and 40% have a normal ESR or CRP. These observations indicate that, although they can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. Physicians and patients would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with RA.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^114km4RM]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence on diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA) informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of D2T RA.

Methods

A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed regarding the optimal confirmation of a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and of mimicking diseases and the assessment of inflammatory disease activity. PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to December 2019. Relevant papers were selected and appraised.

Results

Eighty-two papers were selected for detailed assessment. The identified evidence had several limitations: (1) no studies were found including D2T RA patients specifically, and only the minority of studies included RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the diagnosis of RA or presence of inflammatory activity; (2) mostly only correlations were reported, not directly useful to evaluate the accuracy of detecting inflammatory activity in clinical practice; (3) heterogeneous, and often suboptimal, reference standards were used and (4) (thus) only very few studies had a low risk of bias. To ascertain a diagnosis of RA or relevant mimicking disease, no diagnostic test with sufficient validity and accuracy was identified. To ascertain inflammatory activity in patients with RA in general and in those with obesity and fibromyalgia, ultrasonography (US) was studied most extensively and was found to be the most promising diagnostic test.

Conclusions

This SLR highlights the scarcity of high-quality studies regarding diagnostic issues in D2T RA. No diagnostic tests with sufficient validity and accuracy were found to confirm nor exclude the diagnosis of RA nor its mimicking diseases in D2T RA patients. Despite the lack of high-quality direct evidence, US may have an additional value to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients, including those with concomitant obesity or fibromyalgia.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^114U8a4K]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this SLR, evidence was sought regarding the optimal confirmation of RA and relevant differential diagnoses as well as the assessment of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients in whom there was doubt about the diagnosis or the presence of inflammatory activity. Several limitations were found in the selected evidence. First, no studies were identified including D2T RA patients specifically and only the minority of studies included RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the diagnosis of RA or about the presence of inflammatory activity. Second, a heterogeneous collection of diagnostic tests was evaluated using different association measures, hampering pooling of results. Third, only very few studies with a low RoB were found. Additional limitations were found in the evidence regarding the assessment of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients. Mostly, only correlation measures were reported, which are not directly appropriate to assess a test for indicating the presence or absence of inflammatory disease activity in clinical practice (although a strong correlation is likely a prerequisite). Furthermore, major heterogeneity was found in reference standards used in these studies, reflecting the lack of a true gold standard to assess inflammatory activity. Taking all the above-mentioned limitations into account, the identified evidence should be regarded as indirect for the population of D2T RA patients and the results should be interpreted carefully.

Limited evidence was found to consider specific diagnostic tests to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of RA or relevant differential diagnoses. None of the diagnostic tests in the studies regarding the diagnosis of RA or relevant differential diagnoses were replicated, limiting the validity of the results. The only study with a low RoB showed that adapted ACR 1987 criteria (including GS synovitis, US erosions, RF) and RAMRIS scale of MCP joints had an additional value above the traditional ACR 1987 criteria to rule out the diagnosis of RA (sensitivity 69% and 72%, respectively, compared with 42%), although probably still too low to rule out RA with sufficient certainty. Moreover, classification criteria, such as the ACR 1987 criteria, should only be applied after a diagnosis is made and are inappropriate to make a diagnosis, making these results not applicable to ascertain the diagnosis of RA in clinical practice. Furthermore, in the other study with a low RoB in RA patients who presented with a flare, ESR < 15 mm/hour was shown to be able to rule out and procalcitonin ≥ 0.5 ng/mL to confirm bacterial infection as a mimicking disease. Some studies were found assessing the diagnosis of (concomitant) fibromyalgia, although all these studies had a high RoB.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: a practical guide to state-of-the-art imaging, image interpretation, and clinical implications [^116qD99L]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease of unknown origin that predominantly involves synovial tissue. RA affects 0.5%-1.0% of the global population, with females affected more frequently than males. Early diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy help modify the course of the disease and reduce the degree of severe late sequelae. Radiology plays a key role in diagnosis and management of RA. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging is the best imaging modality because it depicts soft-tissue changes and damage to cartilage and bone even better and at an earlier stage than does computed tomography. Ultrasound and conventional radiography are more readily available but cannot show the entire spectrum of the disease. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis are achieved by identifying certain radiologic parameters, which are also used for grading purposes. The disease does not follow a linear course, especially with the early initiation of potent therapy. Knowledge of the imaging findings enables the radiologist to accurately select the most helpful imaging technique. Familiarity with the pathophysiologic mechanisms of RA, the imaging findings, and the grading systems and a basic knowledge of therapeutic regimens are prerequisites for a tailored diagnostic approach by the radiologist.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^1137w3RU]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly inflammatory, debilitating autoimmune disease with complicated multisystem involvement that is difficult to diagnose in its early stages when the characteristic disease features are not yet apparent. The process of diagnosis is complex and requires the synthesis of many data points, typically beyond a simple algorithm-based set of criteria. Hence, it is not possible to clearly define diagnostic criteria for RA (or other systemic autoimmune diseases); however, recommendations and guidelines for the management and treatment of RA have been developed. In contrast, classification criteria are used as a standardised means for including a well-defined set of patients in clinical studies to ensure better comparability across studies. Importantly, classification criteria are not intended to be used for diagnosis. Nonetheless, they may have some impact on diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Therefore, improving both the specificity and sensitivity of classification criteria across different rheumatic diseases remains a challenge and, in that context, especially the increasing importance of autoantibody testing is being discussed.

RA is classified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2010 criteria, which, apart from clinical items (joint counts), encompass laboratory parameters including inflammation markers (C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and, most importantly, the hallmark autoantibodies of RA, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs). The maximum score of the criteria is 10, with a score ≥ 6 allowing the classification as RA. Among the laboratory parameters, an elevated inflammation marker contributes one point, the presence of RF or ACPA contributes two points if detectable (ie, low positive) and three points if present at levels > 3 times the upper limit of normal as defined by the reference range of the assay. Consequently, laboratory items may account for up to two-thirds of the scores needed to classify definite RA and are thus given a higher weight than in any other set of classification criteria for rheumatic autoimmune diseases.

From this viewpoint, we are discussing the performance of current criteria and their potential refinement according to insights obtained over the past years, including differences between ACPA and RF contribution as well as the emergence of novel antibodies that might be considered for inclusion to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria.

### Early arthritis clinic: a USA perspective [^114CdcbL]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

An early arthritis clinic (EAC) was established to identify early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients for clinical trials and to create a facile method of early patient referral from the practitioner to the rheumatologist. With minimal advertising and promotion, patients with less than 12 months of symptoms were easily referred if the primary care physician suspected a rheumatic condition. Of those patients who were appropriately referred one-third had synovitis, 20% had diagnostic cutaneous findings, 20% were diagnosed with lupus (or lupus-like disease), 12.5% had RA, and 10% were diagnosed with a spondyloarthropathy. An EAC was easily established, implemented and staffed and resulted in the prompt diagnosis and early treatment of many patients who may have otherwise waited months for appropriate rheumatologic diagnosis and treatment.

### Nomenclature for the phases of the development of rheumatoid arthritis [^1157PNj6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Research on RA is increasingly focused on the earliest stages of the disease, and has provided strong evidence that clinical signs and symptoms may be preceded by a preclinical phase during which evidence of systemic autoimmunity may be present. To facilitate research in this area, a number of international initiatives have proposed definitions of the phases of disease leading up to RA. The first of these initiatives was the European League Against Rheumatism's (EULAR) set of recommendations on terminology in persons at risk for RA, which suggested that the "at-risk phases" be described in terms of patients variably having: (A) genetic risk factors for RA; (B) environmental risk factors for RA; (C) systemic autoimmunity associated with RA; (D) symptoms without clinical arthritis; and (E) unclassified arthritis. The phrase clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) is now widely used and can be regarded as describing a subgroup of patients in phase D. A definition of CSA was recently proposed by a EULAR taskforce, and primary research has begun to explore the full range of symptoms, as well as their sensitivity and specificity alone and in combination with other factors, that characterize this phase. Similarly, immune abnormalities at mucosal and others sites that precede and/or are associated with the onset of musculoskeletal symptoms are being increasingly studied and understood. Whether some of these at-risk phases, in particular CSA, represent entities meriting their own classification criteria is an essential area for consensus and will be discussed.

Search strategy

The databases of PubMed and Embase were searched for papers in English until December 2018 for search 1 and December 2019 for search 2. Additionally, the conference abstracts of EULAR and ACR were screened, from 2017 to 2018 for search 1 and from 2017 until 2019 for search 2. Advice regarding the setup of the search strategy was provided by two experienced librarians of Utrecht University (FPW and PHW).

The first search focused on the diagnosis of RA and relevant differential diagnoses. In addition to terms for RA and terms related to diagnostic studies, terms for misdiagnosis and common alternative and coexisting mimicking diseases were included (online supplemental file for search details). During the Task Force meeting, it was agreed to perform a limited search on recent literature on this topic as not much research on (mis-)diagnosis relevant to our project was expected to be present and to have a more focused approach given the many clinical questions on D2T RA that were defined by the Task Force. Therefore, a search limit was set to the last ten years and reference screening was not performed.

The second search focused on the assessment of inflammatory activity. In addition to terms for RA and terms related to diagnostic studies, terms for D2T RA and comorbidities that might influence assessment of inflammatory activity, general terms for inflammation and specific tests to assess inflammatory activity were included (search details in online supplemental file). A search limit was set to the last ten years. In addition, the reference lists of selected papers were manually screened. References published in the year 2000 and later were eligible for inclusion. This cut-off was chosen because of the introduction of bDMARDs around this time and, herewith, the beginning of a new diagnostic and therapeutic landscape regarding acceptable disease activity in the field of RA.

### Windows for intervention in the prearthritis phase of rheumatoid arthritis? A narrative review of key triggering events and potential preventive strategies [^113CCNBH]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals without clinical signs of arthritis, but for different reasons are facing an increased risk for RA (eg, by testing positive for RA-related autoantibodies, presenting with small joint arthralgia, or being a first-degree relative (FDR) to a person with RA), are denoted at-risk subjects. This contrasts with the term pre-RA, which is only to be used for cases where clinical RA is known to have occurred. The risk of progression from at-risk to clinical RA is substantially different depending on the (combination of) factors underlying the at-risk classification, ranging from 0.2% to 57% over a year (table 1), highlighting the significant heterogeneity contained within the term at-risk. Stratifying the risk of progression among at-risk subjects is an important, but challenging, task to achieve personalised management of at-risk patients both in rheumatology and primary care settings. Importantly, risk stratification criteria were recently developed by the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance for Rheumatology Associations, which can be used for defining more homogenous risk groups in clinical trials. It is likely that the characterisation of events that determine the transition from risk phase to overt disease would not only identify potential therapeutic targets but also likely improve individualisation of patient care.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^112oH1op]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification criteria have been developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic diseases in order to gather a homogeneous patient population for clinical studies and facilitate the timely implementation of therapeutic measures. Although classification criteria are not intended to be used for diagnosis, they are frequently used to support the diagnostic process in clinical practice, including clinical decision-making. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) classification criteria for RA are capable of identifying the majority of symptomatic patients with RA already in the earliest stages of the disease who are not yet showing radiographic changes. These patients will also profit from the early implementation of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). However, the risk of misclassification is higher as compared with the former 1987 ACR criteria, which were considerably less sensitive to the recognition of patients with early RA. Of note, the presence of rheumatoid factors (RFs) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has been attributed equal weight in the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria and may contribute up to 50% of the score needed for being classified as RA. However, while ACPAs have been proven to be the most specific serological markers of RA, the specificity of RF is moderate, especially at lower titres. This may lead to the misclassification of RF-positive patients and, consequently, the unjustified implementation of DMARD therapy. Therefore, issues arise on how comprehensive the criteria should be and whether they should be updated and adapted to findings from the past two decades that might increase both their specificity and sensitivity.

### Detecting the earliest signs of rheumatoid arthritis: symptoms and examination [^114wA1YC]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms often occur well in advance of a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, these do not necessarily represent symptoms that are included in classification criteria. Their intensity, frequency, and persistence over time seem to be important in the spectrum from preclinical autoimmunity to classifiable RA. Prospective study of signs and symptoms in individuals at risk for RA will help to determine their onset and relationship with epitope spreading, cytokine evolution, sensitive imaging, and their usefulness in discriminating between individuals patients who will develop incident inflammatory arthritis versus normal controls.

### Practical progress in realisation of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis: results from two matched questionnaires within three years [^112n1nAt]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis and treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been advocated for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This survey focuses on the individual definitions and treatment modalities of rheumatologists, and aims at determining the practical realisation of these concepts.

Methods

A questionnaire to be self completed was handed out at the EULAR Symposium 1997. The main issues dealt with were definition, referral time, diagnosis, follow up, and treatment of early RA. Of the 111 participants, who were from all continents and all age groups, 85 (77%) gave their name and address. In 2000, the same questionnaire was sent to these 85 primary respondents. Forty four questionnaires (52%) were returned, and their results were matched and further evaluated.

Results

The definition of early RA was heterogeneous, but two of three rheumatologists use the term "early" for symptoms shorter than three months. There was a drift towards acceptance of involvement of fewer affected joints. Serological tests obtained for early diagnosis were mostly rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies, usually in combination (approximately 70%), while other tests (antikeratin antibodies, antiperinuclear factor, anti-RA33) were used rarely, but increasingly (21–25% all together). No significant change in the lag time of referral to the specialist of patients with suspected early RA was seen within these three years (< 3 months for 50%, > 6 months for 20%), while the proportion followed up during the first three months increased. At both times, every second rheumatologist started DMARD treatment only when the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were fulfilled. However, in 1997 about 10% were willing to wait for erosions before starting DMARDs, while none did so in 2000. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and antimalarial drugs were the most commonly prescribed DMARDs in early RA, with the first two of these still being in increasing use.

Conclusion

The understanding of "early" rheumatoid arthritis is heterogeneous, but the vast majority of the rheumatologists surveyed regard symptom duration of < 3 months as early. Rheumatoid factor was the most useful laboratory support in early diagnosis. Because there has been no shortening of referral time of patients with new RA within the past three years, and many rheumatologists start DMARDs only when the ACR criteria are fulfilled, it is concluded that guidelines for early referral, as well as for early (rheumatoid) arthritis, are needed.

### Should ACR / EULAR criteria be revised changing the RF and ACPA scores? [^1123YfU6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Current classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) encompass clinical and immunological items and are capable of correctly identifying the majority of symptomatic RA patients. The presence of positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) gaining increasing importance according to their serological titer eases the recognition of RA, yet the debate is open on whether this scoring system ought to be optimized by hierarchizing ACPA or the combination of ACPA and RF over single positivity, prioritizing specificity over sensitivity. The risk of misdiagnosis and misclassification are often entangled, yet they are not the same. In fact, while ideal diagnosis requires 100% sensitivity and specificity, classification criteria are conceived to gather a homogeneous patient population, favoring specificity over sensitivity. Nevertheless, as they are frequently summoned to support the diagnostic process in clinical practice, issues arise on how comprehensive those should be and on how frequently they should be updated in light of novel acquisitions regarding measurable RA-related abnormalities. In this viewpoint two different views on the topic are confronted, discussing the performance of available criteria and the potentiality and pitfalls of their refinement according to novel data on ACPA and RF contribution and emergence of newly discovered specificities.

### How should we manage early rheumatoid arthritis? From imaging to intervention [^117LVdYo]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic and progressive inflammatory disorder of the synovium characterised by destruction of bone and cartilage. It is associated with significant morbidity and economic costs. Recent advances have shown that early diagnosis and timely, intensive therapy of rheumatoid arthritis can modify disease outcomes.

Recent Findings

Current investigations into the role of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in early rheumatoid arthritis suggest these modalities will provide information to assist in the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, identify poor prognostic factors, and aid in the monitoring of response to therapy. New developments in pharmacologic therapy, particularly the development of biologic agents, allow better disease control than was previously achievable, and the early application of these drugs in combination with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs seems to produce the best outcomes.

Summary

The application of novel imaging techniques will aid the target application of biologic therapy within the window of opportunity and aid in the monitoring of response to therapy. This is likely to significantly decrease the rate of structural damage and offers hope of a future when the normal outcome for rheumatoid arthritis will be remission.

### Limited diagnostic and prognostic value of routine radiographs in newly presenting arthritis suspected of rheumatoid arthritis: a retrospective study [^111tHSQ6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Current recommendations suggest that patients with newly presenting arthritis suspected of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should undergo routine radiographs of hands and feet (X-HF) as the presence of RA-associated erosions might be of diagnostic and prognostic value. Our objective was to investigate the prevalence, diagnostic, and prognostic value of RA-associated erosions seen on routine X-HF in a large, recent cohort of patients with newly presenting arthritis.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed between 2016 and 2019 in patients with newly presenting arthritis suspected of RA. Patients were included if arthritis was present at diagnosis, rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein antibodies were measured, RA was noted in the differential diagnosis, and routine X-HF were conducted. Outcomes were the prevalence of one or more RA-associated erosion(s), and whether diagnostic or prognostic classification were changed by erosivity. Seronegative patients, patients without acute phase reactants, and patients with longer symptom duration were analyzed as subgroups.

Results

RA-associated erosions were found in 32 of 724 patients (4.4%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.1–6.2). Erosions led to a change of diagnostic classification in two patients (0.3%, 95% CI 0.01–1.1) and changed prognostic classification in three patients (0.4%, 95% CI 0.1–1.3). Seronegative patients and patients without elevated acute phase reactants had significantly lower prevalence of erosions (χ² 9.4, P = 0.002, χ² 6.5, P = 0.01). Longer symptom duration was not associated with a different prevalence of erosions (χ² 0.4, P = 0.81).

Conclusion

The recommendation of conducting routine X-HF in patients with newly presenting arthritis suspected of RA might be reconsidered due to low prevalence of early erosive disease and lack of diagnostic and prognostic value.

### Evolution of classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how do the 2010 criteria perform? [^114a5HXJ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Classification criteria are created in an attempt to produce a homogenous group of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who can be used for clinical and basic research. The 1987 revised criteria lead to improved performance and more confidence in correct classification compared with the 1958 criteria. As therapies were introduced and early, aggressive approaches to RA management became common, there was a growing need for clinical trials focusing on early RA. The 2010 criteria were created to facilitate study of subjects at earlier stages in the disease. This article reviews the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for reactive arthritis, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a CXR and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^114H1VB2]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Joint level

At joint level, 15 different diagnostic tests were assessed (table 4, onine supplemental table 4). Four diagnostic tests (clinically swollen joints, OST measures, US and MRI) were assessed in more than one study with the same reference standard used per diagnostic test. In none of the studies, there was explicit doubt about the presence of inflammatory activity.

Table 4
Concise summary of papers on the assessment of inflammatory activity at joint level

Almost all studies had a high RoB, predominantly because the cut-off for the optimal sensitivity and specificity was selected by using an ROC curve analysis of the data of the same patient cohort or because the reference standard was not appropriate. The only paper with a moderate RoB was an SLR (including 14 studies), which was performed without critical flaws. In this SLR, synovitis of different joints was assessed with US as diagnostic test and MRI as a reference standard. However, the reference standard used in this SLR (ie, MRI) was regarded as inappropriate to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in the general established RA population, which hampers its applicability.

Using the reference standard deemed appropriate to us (ie, clinical diagnosis of swelling of a joint), three papers were found assessing OST (high RoB). Each study used different diagnostic association measures to report the diagnostic value of OST measures in different joints (sensitivity 37%–59% and specificity 86%–93%; PPV 46% and NPV 86%; area under the ROC 0.88).

### Considerations for improving quality of care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated comorbidities [^113kqTAD]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder with a global prevalence of approximately 0.5–1%. Patients with RA are at an increased risk of developing comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes and depression). Despite this, there are limited recommendations for the management and implementation of associated comorbidities. This study aimed to identify good practice interventions in the care of RA and associated comorbidities.

Methods

A combination of primary research (180+ interviews with specialists across 12 European rheumatology centres) and secondary research (literature review of existing publications and guidelines/recommendations) were used to identify challenges in management and corresponding good practice interventions. Findings were prioritised and reviewed by a group of 18 rheumatology experts including rheumatologists, comorbidity experts, a patient representative and a highly specialised nurse.

Results

Challenges throughout the patient pathway (including delays in diagnosis and referral, shortage of rheumatologists, limited awareness of primary care professionals) and 18 good practice interventions were identified in the study. The expert group segmented and prioritised interventions according to three distinct stages of the disease: (1) suspected RA, (2) recent diagnosis of RA and (3) established RA. Examples of good practice interventions included enabling self-management (self-monitoring and disease management support, for example, lifestyle adaptations); early arthritis clinic; rapid access to care (online referral, triage, ultrasound-guided diagnosis); dedicated comorbidity specialists; enhanced communication with primary care (hotline, education sessions); and integrating patient registries into daily clinical practice.

Conclusion

Learning from implementation of good practice interventions in centres across Europe provides an opportunity to more widely improved care for patients with RA and associated comorbidities.

### The attitudes and practices of physicians caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: an international survey [^1129ggAf]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the level of understanding and opinion among rheumatologist and pulmonologists regarding risk factors, diagnostic approach and treatment of RA-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD).

Methods

We conducted an international electronic survey of rheumatologists and pulmonologists utilizing two separate Redcap-based surveys with questions on the epidemiology, workup and management of RA-ILD as well as ILD screening questions using case-based scenarios directed at rheumatologists. The survey also collected demographic data on participants including their practice setting, years in practice and country of practice.

Results

We received a total of 616 responses (354 rheumatologists and 262 pulmonologists) from six continents. There were significant differences in responses between pulmonologists and rheumatologists in estimated prevalence and mortality, risk factors for the development of ILD in RA and medications that are effective or should be avoided. Rheumatologists were much less likely to consider assessment for ILD in high risk, asymptomatic patients compared with high-risk patients with either symptoms or exam findings suggestive of ILD.

Conclusion

Our study brought to light the variability in disease assessment and clinical practice among providers caring for patients with RA-ILD and indicate that greater education is needed to optimize clinical decision making in the risk assessment, screening and treatment of RA-ILD. Research questions that address appropriate screening and treatment strategies for RA-ILD will be valuable for rheumatologists given their central role in the overall health and lung health of patients with RA.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^1163cvtw]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

When a patient presents with early arthritis (EA), a quick and definite diagnosis is needed to initiate early treatment. The early start of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may improve clinical and radiographic outcomes. A diagnosis of EA may involve several steps, from the detection and confirmation of arthritis to the final diagnosis by a rheumatologist. Predicting a prognosis in a patient with EA is also important in order to offer the best treatment for that patient.

In 2007, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for EA management have been published. These recommendations on EA covered the entire spectrum of EA management, including recognition of arthritis, referral, diagnosis, prognosis, classification, information, education, non-pharmacological interventions and monitoring of the disease process. Between January 2005 (when the systematic literature review (SLR) informing the 2007 recommendations had been performed) and 2015, many publications in the field of EA have been released, notably with crucial data from prospective cohorts of patients with EA. Therefore, the 2007 EULAR recommendations on EA management had to be updated.

The first step in the update was to perform a SLR of the literature available from 2005 onward. Here we report on this SLR that involves the themes referral, diagnosis, prognosis and classification of patients presenting with EA. A separate SLR on the treatment of patients with EA is reported in a separate article.

### Considerations for improving quality of care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated comorbidities [^112cqxB2]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Several challenges in the management of RA and associated comorbidities were identified. Gaps in the care of patients with RA included the following: delays in securing a diagnosis consisting of seeking medical advice (> 12 weeks); referral delays (with a median of 4 visits to the general practitioner before patients are referred to a rheumatologist) leading to an overall delay in diagnosis (in several countries, it can take up to a year from symptom onset); and upon diagnosis and treatment initiation, poor patient adherence to therapy (varying between 30% and 80%) and lack of monitoring (up to 50% of patients do not have access to an regular review in a secondary care setting.) Drivers of these gaps in care were evident at a healthcare system, patient and HCP level (table 1).

Table 1
Gaps in care and their associated drivers evident across the journey of patients with RA

Challenges were also evident throughout the patient pathway for the care of RA-associated comorbidities. One pertinent challenge was the limited guidance for the care of comorbidities in patients with RA (table 2).

Table 2
Gaps in care and their associated drivers evident across the journey of patients with RA-associated comorbidities

Through secondary research, several guidelines and recommendations were identified for some comorbidities, but the presence of guidelines differed depending on the comorbidity (table 3).

Table 3
Guidelines and/or recommendations present for comorbidities in RA

The expert panel recommended to frame the findings of the study against three different stages of disease (table 4).

Table 4
Disease stages

These disease stages were used to segment and prioritise good practice interventions. In total, 18 good practice interventions were identified, through the centre visits, which span across the whole patient pathway. Interventions were highlighted as applicable to one, multiple or all disease stages (table 5).

Table 5
Good practice interventions relevant to the three disease stages of patients with RA

All 18 interventions were reviewed by the expert panel and prioritised by ranking the highest impact on patient outcomes, against each stage of the disease: suspicion of RA; recent diagnosis of RA; established disease (while recognising that for each one of them, patients have distinct needs and requirements). The top three interventions for each disease stage are shown in table 6 and are described in the following sections.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^112eFAEj]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite many unanswered questions in the understanding of the mechanisms driving the immunological changes seen during the development of RA, there is evidence that systemic abnormalities defined as the presence of RA-related autoantibodies can occur several years before clinical symptoms appear. Serological biomarkers can be investigated as predictive factors in subjects that are likely to be at higher risk of developing RA, such as, for instance, first degree relatives of RA patients. Simultaneous assessment of RFs along with various ACPA tests, and presumably with novel serological biomarkers, may be used in screening at the primary care level and may help to identify patients with early disease in subjects with symptoms without clinical arthritis and in those with undifferentiated arthritis or where the clinical judgment is doubtful. In addition, combining positive US Doppler signal with clinical joint assessment can significantly improve certainty of diagnosis of RA in seronegative patients. By revealing subclinical synovitis and radiographically undetected bone erosions, RA can be carefully explored with US especially in patients with early undifferentiated arthritis. Therefore, the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria indicated that US may be used for confirmation of the clinical findings (joint involvement).

In conclusion, novel serological biomarkers along with joint ultrasound may provide additional benefit in diagnosis of RA, particularly in those with early and ACPA negative disease.

### Distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis from psoriatic arthritis [^112Bo5ke]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Accurate diagnosis of PsA and RA is important because, although these diseases have a number of overlapping clinical, serological and radiographic features, differences in underlying pathogenesis and response to therapy translate into substantially different clinical outcomes. An understanding of the various clinical characteristics, triggering factors, comorbidities and extra-articular manifestations of PsA and RA can aid in the determination of the correct diagnosis. Use of laboratory and imaging techniques can be particularly helpful in distinguishing between these two diseases. Once an accurate diagnosis has been made, clinicians can decide which therapy should be used to provide maximal improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA or PsA based on patient and disease characteristics.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^113zPP9X]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Once results are available from formal qualitative studies of the emergence of symptoms in people at risk of RA and in those with a new onset of disease, these results can be used to inform the development of a "symptom questionnaire" to assess the frequency of symptoms and their evolution in individuals at risk of RA. Through this approach, refinement of algorithms for use in secondary care to predict RA development in patients with unclassified arthritis and patients with inflammatory joint symptoms and RA-related autoantibodies may be achieved. Importantly, tools also need to be developed for use in primary care to direct management pathways, including determining which patients with joint-related symptoms should be investigated (e.g. with autoantibody testing or imaging) and who should be referred to a rheumatologist. The patient's history is readily available and inexpensive. Maximizing value from this history and assessing the predictive utility of its components in the earliest phases of RA can only be achieved once these components are fully understood.

### The therapeutic approach of early intervention for rheumatoid arthritis: what is the evidence? [^1145fSwM]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The concepts of early intervention and early arthritis clinics for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were introduced almost a decade ago. The evidence for these is diverse and the best therapeutic approach remains vehemently debated. This review addresses these issues.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched to identify relevant papers satisfying inclusion criteria for disease duration and no previous use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Where possible, evidence was obtained from randomized controlled trials. We selected the most relevant topics to best justify early therapeutic intervention in RA.

Results

The benefit of DMARDs over placebo and delayed therapy is unquestionable from the studies presented, with reduction in bone damage and preservation of function. Through prevention of disability, early treatment should be the most cost-effective approach. The evidence presented supports the use of DMARDs when the diagnosis of RA is first made. Delay in treatment may result in irreversible damage. There is insufficient evidence to recommend combination therapy for all patients at disease onset. Further research into newer therapies is required before their routine first-line use is recommended.

Conclusions

Early therapeutic intervention in RA reduces long-term disability and joint damage. Optimal management appears to be the early identification of non-responders and targeted combination therapy. Biological therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of early RA.

### Laboratory and imaging studies used by French rheumatologists to evaluate patients with early arthritis [^112X6Dcw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a practice survey of laboratory and imaging studies used by French rheumatologists to identify the cause of recent-onset arthritis.

Methods

We selected a random sample of 210 rheumatologists, who were asked to recruit all patients with recent-onset arthritis (at least one joint involved, for less than one year) during a 2 week period, and to record laboratory and imaging studies performed. Results were analyzed in the overall group, in diagnostic subgroups, and in clinical presentation subgroups.

Results

The 119 rheumatologists who participated recruited 104 patients. Investigations done in 50% to 75% of patients were blood cell counts; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum assays of C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, antinuclear antibodies; and hand radiographs. Investigations in 50% to 74% of patients were serum ASAT/ALAT, creatinine, and uric acid; and foot radiographs. Finally, 25% to 49% of patients were tested for proteinuria; antikeratin antibodies; hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Lyme serologies; creatine phosphokinase; blood iron; HLA-B27; and radiographs of chest and pelvis. No differences were found between investigations in patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis and/or undifferentiated arthritis and those in other patients. In contrast, suspected diagnoses and presence of extraarticular manifestations classically associated with specific diseases modified the selection of investigations.

Conclusion

Although considerable variability occurred, our study suggests that a limited panel of laboratory and imaging studies is performed in at least 25% of patients with recent-onset arthritis, regardless of clues suggesting a specific diagnosis.

### 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^115Umhze]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis" for rheumatoid arthritis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical calculator developed jointly by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). This calculator is used to classify patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are applied to patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) not better explained by another disease. The criteria are based on the weighted sum of four domains: joint involvement, serology (including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status), acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and duration of symptoms.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in its early stages, and to differentiate it from other forms of arthritis or joint diseases. It is not intended to be used as the sole criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, but rather as a tool to support clinical judgment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients with conditions that could better explain the synovitis, such as lupus or psoriatic arthritis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis assist in determining whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for the condition by evaluating four main areas: joint involvement, serology, acute phase reactants, and duration of symptoms. Each aspect is assigned a specific score based on the severity or positivity of the criteria.

1. **Joint Involvement**:

- 1 large joint scores 0 points
- 2–10 large joints score 1 point
- 1–3 small joints score 2 points
- 4–10 small joints score 3 points
- More than 10 joints, including at least 1 small joint, score 5 points

2. **Serology**:

- Negative rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 0 points
- Low-positive rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 2 points
- High-positive rheumatoid factor or positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 3 points

3. **Acute Phase Reactants**:

- Normal C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate score 0 points
- Abnormal C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate score 1 point

4. **Duration of Symptoms**:

- Less than 6 weeks scores 0 points
- 6 weeks or more scores 1 point

To determine the total score, each input response is converted into a score according to the predefined scale, and these scores are summed. The cumulative score will fall between 0 and 10.

The interpretation of the total score is straightforward:

- A score of 6 or more indicates that the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis are met.
- A score below 6 suggests that the criteria are not met.

Upon processing the inputs, the calculator provides both the total score and its corresponding interpretation based on these thresholds.

### Novel treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis [^115JT95N]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

New treatment strategies have substantially changed the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients can achieve remission if the disease is recognised early and is treated promptly and continuously; however, some individuals do not respond adequately to treatment. Rapid diagnosis and a treat-to-target approach with tight monitoring and control, can increase the likelihood of remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this Series paper, we describe new insights into the management of rheumatoid arthritis with targeted therapy approaches using classic and novel medications, and outline the potential effects of precision medicine in this challenging disease. Articles are included that investigate the treat-to-target approach, which includes adding or de-escalating treatment. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment is impeded by delayed diagnosis, problematic access to specialists, and difficulties adhering to treat-to-target principles. Clinical management goals in rheumatoid arthritis include enabling rapid access to optimum diagnosis and care and the well informed use of multiple treatments approved for this disease.

### Imaging tests as predictors of progression to rheumatoid arthritis in clinically suspect arthralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iaWQg]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the largest systematic review of imaging tests in preclinical RA and risk of progression to IA/RA to date, we included 12 MRI cohorts, 26 US and 10 on other imaging tests. Risk of bias and clinical applicability were varied, with lack of blinding, consensus or mean results used leading to concern. Most cohorts reported clear recruitment procedures with no inappropriate exclusions conferring low risk of bias for patient selection; however, blinding of imaging results to final diagnosis was a concern. This is relevant as imaging results can influence the final diagnosis ultimately undermining the predictive accuracy of imaging in RA diagnosis.

Whilst predicting RA in individuals with CSA is important for early treatment and progression delay, identifying which patients progress to RA should be as accurate as possible given that over-treatment with DMARDs may confer undesirable side effects and come at a high cost. Therefore, although sensitivity of imaging tests in the preclinical phases of RA is important, specificity is also key.

Ultrasound imaging characteristics largely had high specificities (64–92%) with lower sensitivities (32–64%). Both PD ≥ 1 and GS ≥ 1 with PD ≥ 1 had the highest specificities at 91% and 92%, respectively, at the expense of lower sensitivities 37% and 32%, respectively. This suggests that these ultrasound imaging characteristics will be negative in most people without the disease (true negatives), but may be negative in some people with symptoms who will progress to IA/RA. If we assume that 50% develop RA, we anticipate that 320 would be missed and 35 would be falsely positive in 1000 people with CSA undergoing US imaging (PD ≥ 1). Assuming 20% develop RA, 130 would be missed per 1000 people tested and 60 would be falsely positive. Both GS ≥ 2 and GS ≥ 2 and/or PD > 1 had a reasonable sensitivity (64% and 59%, respectively) and specificity (59% and 64%, respectively). Although the specificity is lower than for antibodies used in 2010 RA classification criteria (e.g. RF 86% or ACPA 96%), sensitivity is slightly higher than reported sensitivities for either antibody (RF 56% or ACPA 58%), hence these features may still be of benefit to clinicians.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^112njHt2]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is still a disease of unclear aetiology. It is an autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition involving many genes and women are more commonly affected than men. What exactly triggers its onset is subject to lively scientific debate, but it seems likely that once the causative abnormal immune process is established in the patient, it becomes self-perpetuating.

Rheumatoid arthritis is largely a synovial based disease with the potential for severe joint destruction, but it often has systemic manifestations. Some authors have suggested that synovitis might be secondary to a more basic disease process first occurring within medullary bone as primary inflammatory infiltrate, but this is subject to debate and not universally accepted. Intriguingly, Ostendorf and co-workers found that bone scintigraphy has demonstrated increased bone turnover in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis without correlating magnet resonance imaging (MRI) findings, while in most patients bone scintigraphic uptake correlated well with MRI changes.

Older classifications of rheumatoid arthritis were insensitive to early rheumatoid arthritis and years could pass between onset of symptoms and definite diagnosis. However studies have shown that the best outcomes are achieved by aggressive treatment within 3–6 months of onset of symptoms. The availability of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs has moved the goalposts and enables disease control and joint preservation unknown in the past but only if treatment is started early enough.

Subsequently the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis were revised. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification assesses joint involvement, blood parameters and duration of symptoms. Unlike the previous criteria, imaging is not part of this primary assessment, though radiographs of the hands might be obtained at the time of diagnosis to establish baseline findings, although, clearly, radiographs are insensitive for the early diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease. Radiographs can be used to monitor disease progression, although they are insensitive for minor change.

### The need to better classify and diagnose early and very early rheumatoid arthritis [^117CZXD8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and very early RA are major targets of research and clinical practice. Remission has become a realistic goal in the management of RA, particularly in early disease. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) RA classification criteria, the EULAR treatment recommendations for RA, and the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis focus on early disease and translate the knowledge related to early RA into classification and management. Nevertheless, there is a need for further improvement and progress. Results from 6 recent studies are summarized, evaluating the performance of the 2010 ACR/EULAR RA classification criteria. The data show a significant risk of misclassification, and highlight that overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis may become important issues if the criteria recommend synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Therefore, some considerations are presented on how the current problems and limitations could be overcome in clinical practice and future research. A consensus is needed to better define the early phase of RA and differentiate from other early arthritis. The possible effect of misclassification on spontaneous and drug-induced remission of early and very early RA awaits further elucidation. Such research will eventually lead to more reliable diagnostic and classification criteria for new-onset RA.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis: a review [^115jkF8m]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs in about 5 per 1000 people and can lead to severe joint damage and disability. Significant progress has been made over the past 2 decades regarding understanding of disease pathophysiology, optimal outcome measures, and effective treatment strategies, including the recognition of the importance of diagnosing and treating RA early.

Observations

Early diagnosis and treatment of RA can avert or substantially slow progression of joint damage in up to 90% of patients, thereby preventing irreversible disability. The development of novel instruments to measure disease activity and identify the presence or absence of remission have facilitated new treatment strategies to arrest RA before joints are damaged irreversibly. Outcomes have been improved by recognizing the benefits of early diagnosis and early therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The treatment target is remission or a state of at least low disease activity, which should be attained within 6 months. Methotrexate is first-line therapy and should be prescribed at an optimal dose of 25 mg weekly and in combination with glucocorticoids; 40% to 50% of patients reach remission or at least low disease activity with this regimen. If this treatment fails, sequential application of targeted therapies, such as biologic agents (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) or Janus kinase inhibitors in combination with methotrexate, have allowed up to 75% of these patients to reach the treatment target over time. New therapies have been developed in response to new pathogenetic findings. The costs of some therapies are considerable, but these costs are decreasing with the advent of biosimilar drugs (drugs essentially identical to the original biologic drugs but usually available at lower cost).

Conclusions and Relevance

Scientific advances have improved therapies that prevent progression of irreversible joint damage in up to 90% of patients with RA. Early treatment with methotrexate plus glucocorticoids and subsequently with other DMARDs, such as inhibitors of TNF, IL-6, or Janus kinases, improves outcomes and prevents RA-related disability. A treat-to-target strategy aimed at reducing disease activity by at least 50% within 3 months and achieving remission or low disease activity within 6 months, with sequential drug treatment if needed, can prevent RA-related disability.

### Imaging in the preclinical phases of rheumatoid arthritis [^1139ZUvi]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is growing evidence that the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multistep process. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) identified different phases before the onset of RA, from the presence of genetic and environmental risk factors for RA, towards clinically suspected arthralgia and undifferentiated arthritis. Currently, a new definition of "window of opportunity" is emerging; this states that the window could even lie in preclinical phase of RA, preceding diagnosis or fulfillment of classification criteria for RA. In this scenario, the detection of subclinical inflammation by imaging tools could be useful together with autoantibodies and joint symptoms to better stratify people at high risk for developing RA and to plan prevention trials in high-risk cohorts. This review will give an overview on the use of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography in the preclinical phases of RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: the continuum of disease and strategies for prediction, early intervention, and prevention [^116YANLt]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to include a pre-RA stage that can be defined as the presence of familial or genetic risk factors, biomarker abnormalities (eg, anticitrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA]), symptoms, and even abnormal imaging findings prior to the development of the onset of clinical RA with inflammatory arthritis that is apparent on physical examination. Indeed, there are multiple completed or ongoing retrospective case-control as well as prospective observational studies to identify the key biologic drivers of disease. Further, building on the predictive ability of combinations of biomarkers, symptoms, and imaging for future RA, there are multiple clinical trials completed, underway, or in development to identify approaches that may prevent, delay, or ameliorate future clinical RA in at-risk individuals. Importantly, however, although an effective preventive intervention has not yet been identified, at-risk individuals are being increasingly identified in clinical care; this presents a challenge of how to manage these individuals in clinical practice. This review will discuss the current understanding of the biology and natural history of RA development, nomenclature, and current models for prediction of future RA, as well as evaluate the current and ongoing clinical prevention trials with the overall goal to provide insights into the challenges and opportunities in the field of RA prevention. Moreover, this review will provide up-to-date options for clinical management of individuals at risk for RA.

### Difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: an area of unmet clinical need [^112kCMSb]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Increased effectiveness of pharmacological treatments in early RA has led many to believe that difficult-to-treat, established RA is a condition of the past. However, there are still plenty of RA patients who continue to have signs and symptoms suggestive of inflammatory disease activity, despite consecutive treatment with multiple conventional synthetic and biological DMARDs. We argue that difficult-to-treat RA constitutes an area of unmet clinical need and propose a definition of this concept. An overview of what is known about the multiple contributory factors varying for each individual patient, and an approach towards improved patient-tailored management are presented. This management approach involves thorough assessment to determine whether persistence of signs and symptoms is based on inflammatory disease activity, and the role of comorbidities. Furthermore, it addresses medication-related issues, such as non-adherence, patient beliefs and expectations, and setting of realistic treatment goals.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^116SksYg]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology (ACR) rheumatoid arthritis guideline — recommendation strength and voting threshold — states that both strong and conditional recommendations required achieving a 70% level of agreement by the voting panel; each recommendation is qualified as being strong or conditional; strong recommendations are those for which the panel is highly confident that the recommended option favorably balances the expected benefits and risks for the majority of patients in clinical practice, whereas conditional recommendations are those for which the panel is less confident that the potential benefits outweigh the risks, and a recommendation can be conditional either because of low or very low certainty in the evidence supporting one option over another or because of an expectation of substantial variations in patient preferences for the options under consideration.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115RwZE9]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–mediated heart failure (HF) diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion with supportive testing. Diagnostic strategies for RA-mediated HF include biomarkers such as BNP, echocardiography, and angiography to exclude atherosclerosis as an intermediate cause. Cardiac involvement can manifest with pericardial effusions, diastolic dysfunction, and inflammatory findings on nuclear scans and cardiac MR. There is no pathognomonic diagnostic test, and biopsy can reveal diffuse, necrotizing, or granulomatous patterns that are nonspecific.

### Systematic review: accuracy of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis [^116195D1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Early recognition and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is important to prevent irreversible joint damage. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) have been suggested for early diagnosis.

Purpose

To compare the accuracy of ACPA and rheumatoid factor in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis in patients with early symptoms of the disease.

Data Sources

10 medical databases from inception to September 2009, with no language or publication restrictions, and references of included studies.

Study Selection

Two independent reviewers screened searches. Full articles were assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer to identify studies that reported 2 × 2 data on ACPA for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (by 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria).

Data Extraction

One reviewer abstracted data on patient characteristics, ACPA details, and 2 × 2 data and assessed study quality by using the QUADAS tool. A second reviewer checked extractions.

Data Synthesis

151 studies were included, with considerable heterogeneity in sensitivity (range, 12% to 93%) and specificity (range, 63% to 100%). In cohort studies that investigated second-generation anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (< 2 years), summary sensitivity and specificity were 57% (95% CI, 51% to 63%) and 96% (CI, 93% to 97%), respectively. Case-control and cross-sectional studies and studies of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis all overestimated sensitivity. Anti-CCP2 had greater specificity than rheumatoid factor (96% vs. 86%), with similar sensitivity. Evidence was insufficient to ascertain whether the combination of anti-CCP2 and rheumatoid factor provides additional benefit over anti-CCP2 alone.

Limitations

Most studies used a diagnostic case-control design, which overestimated sensitivity. Items relating to study quality were rarely reported. Publication bias could not be assessed.

Conclusion

Anti-CCP2 should be included in the work-up of patients with early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Imaging tests as predictors of progression to rheumatoid arthritis in clinically suspect arthralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YYnys]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease which can cause progressive joint damage and deformity. Management of RA is aimed at controlling inflammation and slowing disease progression with DMARDs; however, delaying treatment may result in irreversible structural damage leading to functional disability affecting overall productivity and quality of life. Early diagnosis leads to earlier initiation of treatment with disease modifying agents (DMARDs) improving outcomes. In the absence of a definite diagnostic test, RA classification criteria are often used to aid diagnosis. Focus is being shifted towards identifying individuals at higher risk of RA, before clinical inflammatory arthritis (IA) becomes evident. Inflammatory arthralgia has been identified as a phase preceding the development of IA and a sensitive predictor of RA. EULAR has defined arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA or clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) based on items including inflammatory joint symptoms, to be used in patients with no apparent clinical arthritis. Approximately 20% of CSA will progress to RA. DMARDs started at the CSA phase might improve outcomes compared with initiation at more advanced phases. However, DMARDs may confer side effects, regular monitoring blood tests and high costs, hence the importance of predicting which patients are at a higher risk of RA. Recent trials on interventions in the preclinical phases of RA, such as CSA, have taken into account subclinical inflammation. Both ultrasound and MRI can detect subclinical synovitis in people with arthralgia. Other imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), scintigraphy and optical spectral transmission (OST) imaging are also being investigated. Subclinical inflammation on imaging may help identify which CSA patients are at a higher risk of progression. However, there is no systematic review evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests in the CSA population. Identifying these 'at risk' patients may offer an earlier window of opportunity crucial in delaying or even preventing RA, which may in turn reduce RA morbidity and associated mortality. We conducted a systematic review to determine and compare the accuracy of imaging tests in predicting RA/IA in people with arthralgia.

### Factors associated with quality care among adults with rheumatoid arthritis [^111ji4G3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Early diagnosis and treatment of RA are associated with better outcomes including lower rates of radiographic progression and development of disability. Despite widespread evidence supporting early treatment, the quality of health care for patients with RA is suboptimal. Using select quality care markers, our study aimed to identify the prevalence of missed markers based on patient demographic data and examine whether these markers have an association with other markers. Our study found downstream associations of some RA quality care markers, including rheumatologist referral and receiving DMARDs. Notable variation existed among demographic characteristics associated with achieving quality care measures. In addition, only 27 patients of the 581 770 included in the cohort met all care markers; there is an urgent need to improve the progression of care for patients with RA.

The American College of Rheumatology and the Arthritis Foundation recommend that patients should be referred to a rheumatologist for diagnostic evaluation and management of inflammatory arthritis. Despite this, only 44.1% of patients in our study received a referral to a rheumatologist within 1 year of diagnosis. This time was longer but consistent with previous literature, which has reported average delays of 115 days between initial presentation and rheumatologist referral. Receiving a rheumatologist referral had variable associations with meeting other quality care markers, conferring greater odds of receiving hand radiographs and laboratory testing but lower odds of receiving DMARDs with appropriate hepatitis B screening or a PT, OT, or hand surgery referral. Because early RA treatment estimates improved outcomes, this negative finding may result from inappropriate timing of DMARD initiation or surgery if a patient is referred long after symptom onset. DMARDs can slow RA progression and improve long-term disability; however, treatment must be started early in symptom onset (within 12 weeks) to obtain maximal protection. In addition, lack of agreement and collaboration between rheumatologists and hand surgeons may prevent patients from receiving a hand surgery referral after seeing a rheumatologist. The findings related to receiving a rheumatologist referral suggest the importance of early action so subsequent quality care markers may be met.

### Do we need to lower the cut point of the 2010 ACR / EULAR classification criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis? [^116Y9EKp]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria to identify more patients with RA among early inflammatory arthritis patients.

Methods

We included early arthritis patients from the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort with at least one joint with clinical synovitis and symptoms for < 1 year, with no other explanation for their symptoms. The demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient were recorded at baseline. Patients were classified as case or non-case at the 1-year follow-up by the definition used in the development of the 2010 criteria (MTX initiation). To assess the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria, the sensitivity and specificity at each cut point were determined.

Results

We included 557 patients in our analysis. At the 1-year follow-up, 253 patients (45%) were classified as case (MTX use). In the group of patients who scored 0–5 points (n = 328), 98 patients (30%) were classified as case (MTX use). The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria using the cut point of 6 were 61% and 76%, respectively. With the cut point of 5, the sensitivity would increase to 76% and the specificity would decrease to 68%.

Conclusion

By lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria from 6 to 5 points, we were able to identify 15% more RA patients at the cost of 8% more false-positive patients.

### Autoantibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis: still a challenge for the rheumatologist [^114QUTZU]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Increased research over the past 30 years has greatly improved the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical aspects of autoantibody-positive rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in improved management and outcomes. In contrast, the subset of rheumatoid arthritis that does not have autoantibodies (such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies) remains less well defined in its pathogenic mechanisms. Autoantibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis continues to pose diagnostic challenges, might respond differently to therapies, and appears to be burdened with different comorbidities and outcomes. The clear separation of rheumatoid arthritis according to serotypes is still a subject of uncertainty and controversy, and studies specifically focused on comparing rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis-like arthritides that do not have autoantibodies remain scarce. The purpose of this Review is to summarise the peculiarities that make autoantibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis different from its autoantibody-positive counterpart, with the aim of generating debate and stimulating further research on this challenging condition.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^114SNsi5]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria turned out to be more sensitive than the 1987 revised ACR criteria and to facilitate early identification of patients with RA immediately after the onset of symptoms, that is, synovitis in at least one small or two large joints. This allows not only the inclusion of patients with early arthritis in clinical studies but also a more timely start of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), depending on the healthcare setting. The higher sensitivity has been demonstrated in several studies, which, however, also revealed decreased specificity. The lower specificity partially relates to RF and ACPA positivity, as was documented in a study in which the criteria were applied to a cohort of patients with very early inflammatory arthritis. Among misclassified patients (non-RA with a score ≥ 6), 20.5% were RF and/or ACPA positive; of note, the majority of these patients were RF positive, whereas ACPA was less frequently detected. Furthermore, dual RF/ACPA positivity was largely confined to patients with RA. Hence, at the seventh International Congress on Controversies in Rheumatology and Autoimmunity, a discussion was initiated to improve the specificity of the criteria attributed to the ACPA-based and RF-based serological signatures by changing the weight factors of the serological grades.

### Early rheumatoid arthritis [^111VdEjR]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides novel and updated information on pathogenesis, referral, and clinical characteristics as well as therapeutic approaches in early rheumatoid arthritis.

Recent Findings

Early referral is important, but new classification criteria for early rheumatoid arthritis need to be elaborated. Predictive markers for rheumatoid arthritis are still confined to autoantibodies; respective algorithms have been presented. Other biomarkers will still have to prove their usefulness. Magnetic resonance imaging and sonography do not appear to sufficiently distinguish between early rheumatoid and nonrheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis has become milder at presentation in recent years. In its very early stages, the cytokine profile reflects T-cell activation and switches to abundant proinflammatory cytokines thereafter. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs plus glucocorticoids are highly effective, as is early use of tumor necrosis factor blockers plus methotrexate. Tight control of disease activity and subsequent therapeutic adjustments are highly effective. Disease activity indices that are simple to calculate have been presented and validated. Early intensive therapy may lead to decrease in disability and cost reduction in rheumatoid arthritis.

Summary

Understanding of early arthritis is increasing, especially in prognostic and therapeutic respects, and new treatment strategies appear to improve the outcome in patients with early arthritis. Nevertheless, much remains to be studied to better address the issue of early rheumatoid arthritis.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^116FdAAc]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence pertaining to the diagnosis, prognosis and classification of patients with early arthritis (EA), and to inform the 2016 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of patients with EA.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched up to October 2015. The first part of the systematic literature review (SLR) involved a search for studies investigating the recognition and referral of EA. The second part involved a search for studies to identify the place of laboratory and imaging tests in establishing a diagnosis and a prognosis in patients with EA.

Results

Regarding the issue of referral of patients with EA (1643 hits), 4 studies were included. These studies were in support of early referral for patients with EA. Regarding the issue of diagnosis and prognosis of patients with EA (11 435 hits), 88 studies were included, evaluating mainly the value of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated-peptide antibodies (ACPAs). Sensitivity of these antibodies for a RA diagnosis in patients with EA was moderate (40–80%). Specificity was higher, notably for ACPAs (frequently > 80%). ACPAs also showed better prognostic performance than RF (negative predictive values around 80%). We confirmed that structural damage on baseline X-rays is predictive of further radiographic progression in patients with EA. Regarding other imaging modalities, data are sparse.

Conclusions

This SLR highlights the importance of early referral for patients with EA and confirms that RF and mainly ACPAs as well as a search for structural X-rays changes may help in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with EA.

### How to approach the Imaging differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases by anatomic location [^116ULc1e]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present an approach to differential diagnosis based on the particular features of involvement of the most common rheumatological conditions focused on anatomic location (by joint). The most common radiological signs and how they are demonstrated in different modalities, as well as the typical patterns of involvement are analyzed, with the aim to facilitate the differential diagnosis. Early and adequate adjustment of treatment has an effect on outcome, and on this basis, early diagnosis and characterization are paramount to appropiately manage patients.

### Rheumatologic conditions in children who may present to the orthopaedic surgeon [^116jJwJt]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by onset of chronic arthritis in childhood. Diagnosis requires onset of disease by age 16 years, persistent arthritis in any joint for ≥ 6 weeks, and exclusion of other conditions that cause arthritis (eg, infection, malignancy, acute rheumatic fever, inflammatory bowel disease). Most patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis present with subacute arthritis with minimal pain and few constitutional symptoms. Laboratory evaluation and imaging are useful to exclude other diagnoses and establish the presence of systemic inflammation. However, these modalities are of limited value in screening for rheumatic diseases, and they may be misleading because of the high rate of false-positive results. Most rheumatologic conditions are diagnosed based on pattern recognition, which is established with a thorough history and physical examination.

### The new ACR / EULAR classification criteria for RA: how are the new criteria performing in the clinic? [^115bPcKr]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for RA was to distinguish patients at high risk for developing persistent erosive and/or inflammatory disease from those with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis. These criteria were developed for use in clinical trials; in order to implement these criteria most effectively, they need to be validated in real-world settings. The 1987 criteria may have led to underdiagnosis in the case of patients with positive anti-citrullinated peptide antibody values but no evidence of radiographic progression of joint erosion, or overdiagnosis in the case of some patients with FM; similarly, the possibility that the 2010 criteria may result in overdiagnosis cannot be excluded. Prospective validation of the 2010 criteria has been carried out in several cohorts, with reported sensitivities ranging from 0.50 to 0.60 and specificities from 0.88 to 0.97. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria were 0.74 and 0.66 when compared against the gold standard of needing MTX therapy in the opinion of experienced clinicians, and 0.69 and 0.72 against the standard of having persistent synovitis despite DMARDs after 1 year. Other comparisons have yielded similar sensitivities and specificities, ranging up to 0.85 for the gold standard of needing MTX therapy. Questions remain concerning the utility of the 2010 criteria for non-arthritis health care practitioners, who may be less than expert in identifying swollen joints and may underestimate the number of joints affected by synovitis. US may be of value in the future, but its role remains to be validated.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^115FTD3x]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY MESSAGES

The current American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria provide the same scoring weight to positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) results.
However, the specificity of RF in the absence of ACPA is low, whereas the specificity of ACPA in the absence of RF is high.
ACPA/RF dual positivity is considerably more specific than ACPA single positivity and patients with arthralgia with dual positivity have a higher risk of progressing towards RA than those solely positive for ACPA.
Changing weight factors according to the function of serological grades improves the specificity of the RA classification criteria without affecting sensitivity.
The added value of other antimodified protein antibodies to the increased sensitivity and/or specificity of the criteria remains a topic of debate.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114gueHy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis (IA) — workup, evaluation, and monitoring include comprehensive assessment and staged testing. For G1, complete rheumatologic history and examination of all peripheral joints for tenderness, swelling, and range of motion with examination of the spine; consider plain X-ray or imaging to exclude metastases and evaluate joint damage; consider autoimmune blood panel including ANA, RF, anti-CCP, and inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP); and if symptoms are suggestive of reactive arthritis or affect the spine, consider HLA B27 testing. For G2, complete history and labs as above; consider ultrasound ± MRI of affected joints if clinically indicated, consider arthrocentesis if septic or crystal-induced arthritis is suspected, and consider early rheumatology referral if there is joint swelling or if symptoms persist > 4 weeks. For G3–4, as for grade 2 with rheumatologist advice; test for viral hepatitis B, C, and latent or active TB before DMARD treatment and repeat screening labs annually in those requiring biologic treatment for > 1 year. Patients with IA should be monitored with serial rheumatologic examinations, including inflammatory markers, every 4–6 weeks after treatment is instituted.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: what is refractory disease and how to manage it? [^1113rcCs]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the enthusiastic progresses in the field of rheumatoid arthritis pharmacotherapy the presence of prognostic factors associated with an unfavorable outcome and the inappropriate and/or delayed initiation of DMARDs can diminish the likelihood of achieving remission and increase the probability of refractoriness to treatment. During the last decade we have experience exciting developments regarding the approval of new treatment options but few patients are reaching sustained remission and refractory patients continue to be a problem. Thus, it is critical to understand how clinicians can decrease the risk of refractoriness by close monitoring disease activity, using well defined and accepted composite measures, and by early and optimized use of DMARDs, including biologics. The goal of this review paper is to offer an evidence based roadmap to prevent and to deal with refractory RA.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^112g8HL5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment — guiding principles in the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline specify that RA requires early evaluation, diagnosis, and management; that treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process and should be reevaluated within a minimum of 3 months based on efficacy and tolerability of the DMARD(s) chosen; that disease activity levels refer to those calculated using RA disease activity measures endorsed by the ACR; that recommendations are intended for the general RA patient population and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the options under consideration; and that recommendations are limited to DMARDs approved by the US FDA for treatment of RA. The principles define serious infection as an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization and state that biosimilars are considered equivalent to FDA-approved originator bDMARDs. Treat-to-target refers to a systematic approach involving frequent monitoring of disease activity using validated instruments and modification of treatment to minimize disease activity with a goal of reaching a predefined target (low disease activity or remission), and targets refer to low disease activity or remission; recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering, with dose reduction defined as lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD and gradual discontinuation defined as gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.

### Postpublication validation of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: where do we stand? [^113k3bhA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarise the results of the validation studies testing the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to date and highlight the areas for future research.

Recent Findings

The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed aiming to identify patients early in the natural history of the disease. Validation studies conducted since their publication have demonstrated that, compared with the 1987 ACR criteria for RA, the 2010 criteria identify more patients earlier in the disease course. Sensitivity for the initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and persistent disease is increased, with decreased specificity. Patients who are seronegative may not satisfy the 2010 criteria despite meeting the 1987 criteria at presentation. The 2010 criteria may also incorrectly classify some patients with self-limiting disease as RA.

Summary

The 2010 criteria appear to be superior to the 1987 criteria in terms of identifying individuals with early RA. Their validity in established disease and their ability to predict worse prognosis in the long term have yet to be determined.

### Challenges in imaging in preclinical rheumatoid arthritis [^112hwLYo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

There exists a preclinical phase to the disease progression of rheumatoid arthritis, in which there is evidence of autoimmunity but no overt clinical arthritis. Identifying patients in this phase would allow for early treatment, to potentially halt manifestation of the disease. Imaging, because it is noninvasive, provides an appealing alternative to gold-standard synovial biopsies for identification of these preclinical patients. Ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography all have their advantages and disadvantages as imaging modalities in this regard. Further research into alternative imaging modalities with larger cohorts is required to determine the most effective technique.

In the next 12 months, 7500 Canadians and 75,000 Americans will be afflicted with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Little is known about the health care use of patients with early RA. Nonetheless, rheumatologists and outcomes researchers strongly endorse the need for early diagnosis and treatment of this population. This article reviews trends and impediments to early referral of new-onset arthritis patients. The slow growth of early arthritis clinics is summarized in a survey that characterizes 23 early arthritis programs in North America. Also, several screening tools and models to capture these early-onset arthritis patients are presented.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^113jsUCX]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of D2T RA

The EULAR definition of D2T-RA provided an effective framework to develop the EULAR points to consider (PtC) in the management of D2T-RA. Indeed, while the definition lends itself towards including a heterogeneous patient group, the PtC advise DMARD strategies based on clear demonstration of persistent active inflammatory pathology, an overarching principle being 'The presence or absence of inflammation should be established to guide pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions'. This clarity is crucial in the management of D2T RA to mitigate unnecessary cycling of further DMARD therapies. One of the specific PtC highlights that musculoskeletal ultrasound may be an effective tool where evaluation of inflammation proves challenging. This may serve to reassure the rheumatologist and the patient if a decision is made not to change DMARD despite ongoing symptoms and measured disease activity. In this regard, acceptance of a low disease activity state as stated in the treat to target recommendations may be more appropriate.

This overarching principle also supports consideration of other factors that may complicate accurate assessment of disease activity state. Obesity and fibromyalgia are highlighted as two prevalent conditions in people with RA that should be accommodated when evaluating disease activity and progression to D2T-RA. Secondary fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis may overestimate patient global health scores and tender joint count assessments. Obesity may make accurate detection of swollen joint count challenging and/or overestimate acute phase reactants and contribute to an excess inflammatory drive and phenotype. A reappraisal of the diagnosis and the need to identify coexistent disease and/or mimics that may interfere with the assessment of disease activity were also recommended. Modern RA paradigms encourage us to seek out new and early diagnoses of RA, risking misdiagnosis at the earliest stages of diseases when often still evolving. The hazards of mimics and coexistent pathology is relevant across a patient's disease course including in the older demographic when conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica and/or osteoarthritis may complicate the clinical assessment.
