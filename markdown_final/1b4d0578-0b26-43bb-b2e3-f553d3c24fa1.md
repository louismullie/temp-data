## Question

Understand the incidence rate of shingles in the general population and the implications for public health.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the incidence of shingles (herpes zoster) in the general population, including how it varies by age, sex, and immunocompromise, and what the public health implications are for vaccination and burden of disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources that define baseline incidence in immunocompetent adults. Then, I should verify age-specific gradients and sex differences. Next, I will examine high-risk groups such as people with HIV, cancer, and autoimmune disease. After that, I need to check recurrence rates and complications that drive morbidity. Finally, I will integrate vaccine effectiveness and policy implications to contextualize the burden and prevention strategy, making sure I reconcile any conflicting estimates along the way.

> Let me first confirm the baseline incidence in the general immunocompetent adult population. Multiple high-quality sources converge on an overall incidence of roughly 2–4 per 1,000 person-years in mixed-age adults, with CDC summaries citing approximately 2–9 per 1,000 person-years and a commonly cited figure of about 3.6 per 1,000 person-years in the general population, which aligns with UK primary care data and HIV-focused epidemiology summaries [^111upqMD] [^111J8Brd] [^112msmvB]. Wait, let me verify the most granular recent data: in a large integrated health system cohort of immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults aged 50 years and older, the incidence was 9.92 per 1,000 person-years, which is higher than the all-ages general population estimate because it excludes younger, lower-risk groups, so this is directionally consistent rather than contradictory [^111dfVM7] [^115Q1PH8].

> I need to check the age gradient next. Incidence rises steeply with age due to waning cell-mediated immunity, from around 3.5 per 1,000 person-years in adults 50–54 years to about 7.1 per 1,000 person-years in those 75–79 years in UK data, and reaching roughly 10–11 per 1,000 person-years in those over 80 in US datasets, which explains why lifetime risk approaches 30% and exceeds 50% in those who live to 85 years [^111J8Brd] [^112mzZLs] [^111dfVM7]. Hold on, I should verify consistency: the English evaluation also modeled a peak around age 83 years near 9.9 per 1,000 person-years, reinforcing the strong age dependence across settings [^111FmWAb].

> Let me consider sex differences. I should confirm whether females have higher incidence than males. Several administrative and cohort datasets show higher rates in women, for example 3.8 vs 2.6 per 1,000 person-years in a large US claims analysis, and similar female predominance in Japanese prefecture data, which likely reflects both biological and healthcare-seeking factors rather than a true incidence paradox [^113nVxQK] [^115mBJGA]. But wait, what if this is just coding bias? The consistency across geographies and time periods, along with biological plausibility given immunosenescence patterns, supports a modest female excess in incidence [^113nVxQK] [^115mBJGA].

> Next, I should review high-risk immunocompromised populations. In adults with HIV, incidence remains about 3–5 times higher than the general population even in the ART era, with rates near 9–10 per 1,000 person-years and higher risk with lower CD4 counts or detectable viremia, which is a consistent signal across multiple eras and guidelines [^114goL87] [^112msmvB] [^114RpKm3]. Hold on, I should verify cancer cohorts: hematologic malignancies and early post-diagnosis periods carry markedly elevated zoster risk, with incidence particularly high in the first two years after cancer diagnosis, supporting early vaccination when safe and feasible [^113VytW7]. I will now examine autoimmune disease: rheumatoid arthritis approximately doubles risk, and inflammatory bowel disease confers a 20–60% increase, with immunosuppressive therapies further amplifying risk, especially corticosteroids and thiopurines, which aligns with gastroenterology and rheumatology cohorts [^111xdEEX] [^116sBK98] [^117SMPfc]. Let me reconsider severity gradations: claims-based analyses also show a dose-response by degree of immunosuppression, with the highest incidence in severely immunocompromised adults compared with moderately or mildly immunosuppressed peers [^115hDPoa].

> I should double-check recurrence and complications because they materially affect burden. In immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older, recurrence occurs at about 10.96 per 1,000 person-years with a 10-year cumulative recurrence near 10%, which is nontrivial for lifetime risk modeling and supports vaccination even after a prior episode [^111dfVM7] [^11372Yi2]. Let me verify complications: postherpetic neuralgia affects roughly 10–18% of cases overall and rises with age, while hospitalization occurs in about 1–4% and is concentrated in older adults and the immunocompromised; rare but serious complications such as zoster ophthalmicus, encephalitis, and disseminated disease also contribute to morbidity and cost [^114Mbn5U] [^112e6JzQ] [^114T2VXY]. Wait, I should confirm mortality: CDC attributes fewer than 100 deaths per year in the US, almost all in older or immunocompromised individuals, which underscores the disproportionate impact in these groups [^114Mbn5U] [^111upqMD].

> Now, I need to ensure the vaccine effectiveness context is accurate. Initially, I thought the live zoster vaccine reduced incidence by about 51% based on the Shingles Prevention Study, but hold on, I should verify durability: real-world analyses show substantial waning of live vaccine effectiveness over time, with average effectiveness around 41% over 10 years, which helps explain the preferential shift to recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in current policy [^114JvMqd] [^112cyiYi]. Let me confirm RZV performance: phase 3 trials show approximately 97% efficacy in adults 50 and older and about 90% in those 70 and older, and population programs have demonstrated meaningful reductions in zoster and postherpetic neuralgia within a few years of implementation, consistent with high effectiveness at the population level [^114JvMqd] [^113vkUEC] [^111A54t7]. I should also verify policy scope: ACIP recommends RZV for all adults 50 years and older, and for immunocompromised adults 19 years and older, reflecting both the age gradient and the elevated risk in immunocompromised hosts [^114g2W58] [^1137fhkA].

> Let me synthesize the burden and public health implications. With roughly 1 million cases annually in the US and a lifetime risk near one in three, and with incidence rising as populations age, the aggregate burden is substantial and will intensify without improved uptake of effective vaccines, especially RZV given its superior and more durable protection compared with live vaccine [^111upqMD] [^112HxoJU]. Hold on, I should verify cost and system impact: modeling and observational analyses project large increases in cases among adults 65 and older absent better prevention, translating into billions in annual costs, which strengthens the economic case for routine RZV vaccination in adults 50 years and older and in younger immunocompromised patients [^111inXXy] [^1169P7Vm]. But wait, what about equity and uptake? Coverage remains suboptimal, with persistent racial and socioeconomic disparities, so addressing access, counseling, and provider recommendation is essential to realize population-level benefits [^111AznhQ] [^1114Fcr4].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the core message. The incidence of shingles in the general immunocompetent adult population is approximately 2–4 per 1,000 person-years, with a steep age gradient that drives lifetime risk to about one in three, higher rates in women, and markedly elevated risks in immunocompromised groups including people with HIV, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Recurrence is not rare, and complications such as postherpetic neuralgia and hospitalizations are concentrated in older and immunocompromised patients, all of which underpin current recommendations for routine RZV vaccination in adults 50 years and older and in immunocompromised adults 19 years and older to mitigate the substantial and growing public health burden [^111upqMD] [^111J8Brd] [^111dfVM7] [^114g2W58] [^1137fhkA].

---

The incidence of shingles in the general population is **3–4 per 1,000 person-years** [^111upqMD] [^111J8Brd], rising with age to 7–11 per 1,000 in adults ≥ 50 years [^111dfVM7] and 10–18 per 1,000 in those ≥ 80 years [^113nVxQK] [^115Q1PH8]. Lifetime risk is **about 1 in 3** [^111upqMD], reaching 1 in 2 in those ≥ 85 years [^111J8Brd]. Incidence is higher in women and immunocompromised individuals, and increases with age due to waning cell-mediated immunity [^113TRkKD] [^114goL87]. Vaccination reduces incidence and complications, but uptake remains suboptimal [^113vkUEC] [^111AznhQ].

---

## Incidence rates by age group

Incidence **increases with age**, driven by declining cell-mediated immunity [^113TRkKD]:

| **Age group** | **Incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years)** |
|-|-|
| < 50 years | 2–4 [^115mBJGA] |
| 50–59 years | 3.5–5.0 [^111J8Brd] |
| 60–69 years | 5.0–7.0 [^111FmWAb] |
| 70–79 years | 7.0–10.0 [^111J8Brd] |
| ≥ 80 years | 10.0–18.0 [^113nVxQK] [^112mzZLs] |

---

## Lifetime risk

Lifetime risk is **approximately 33%** [^111upqMD] in the general population, rising to about 50% in those aged ≥ 85 years [^111J8Brd].

---

## Demographic variations

- **Sex**: Women have a slightly higher incidence than men, particularly in older age groups [^113nVxQK] [^115mBJGA].
- **Ethnicity**: Higher incidence in non-Hispanic whites compared to non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics [^111upqMD].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Incidence is 2–10 times higher in immunocompromised populations, including HIV-positive individuals, cancer patients, and transplant recipients [^114goL87] [^113VytW7] [^115hDPoa].

---

## Temporal trends

Incidence has **increased over recent decades** [^115dN4P3], likely due to aging populations, improved diagnostics, and better case ascertainment [^113Z73DD]. The introduction of varicella vaccination has not significantly altered shingles incidence in adults to date [^111upqMD] [^115dN4P3].

---

## Geographic variations

Incidence varies by region, with **higher rates in North America and Europe** compared to Asia and Africa, likely reflecting demographic differences, healthcare access, and reporting practices [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

- **Age**: The strongest risk factor due to immunosenescence [^117LsgQq].
- **Immunosuppression**: HIV, malignancy, and immunosuppressive therapies [^114goL87] [^113VytW7].
- **Chronic conditions**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases [^117LsgQq] [^111xdEEX].
- **Family history**: Increased risk with a family history of shingles [^111WbBEb].

---

## Impact of vaccination

Vaccination significantly reduces shingles incidence and complications. The **live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax)** reduces incidence by about 51% and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) by 67% [^111es85q] [^112cyiYi]. The **recombinant subunit vaccine (Shingrix)** reduces incidence by about 90% and PHN by 85–90% [^114JvMqd] [^113vkUEC]. Despite these benefits, **vaccine uptake remains suboptimal**, with coverage around 30–40% in many countries [^111AznhQ] [^1114Fcr4].

---

## Complications and burden

Shingles carries substantial morbidity, notably **PHN** — chronic pain lasting months to years — which occurs in 10–18% of cases and increases with age [^112e6JzQ] [^114Mbn5U]. Other complications include **ocular involvement, neurological complications, and secondary infections** [^114T2VXY]. Hospitalization is required in 1–4% of cases, mostly in older adults and immunocompromised individuals [^111upqMD] [^112e6JzQ].

---

## Public health implications

The aging population and rising incidence underscore the need for **effective vaccination strategies** and public health interventions [^113Z73DD]. Improved vaccine uptake, especially among high-risk groups, is essential to reduce the burden of shingles and its complications [^113vkUEC].

---

The incidence of shingles in the general population is **3–4 per 1,000 person-years**, rising with age and with significant morbidity. Vaccination is effective but underutilized, highlighting the need for improved public health strategies [^111upqMD] [^111AznhQ].

METHODS

Setting

This study (GSK study identifier, HO-17–18378) was conducted using electronic health records (EHRs) at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated health care organization that provides prepaid comprehensive health care to more than 4.6 million members. EHRs included information on sociodemographics, health care utilization (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient encounters), diagnoses, laboratory tests, pharmacy utilization, vaccination records, membership history, and death. The demographic composition at KPSC is representative of the Southern California population. Compared to the racial/ethnic distribution in the United States, KPSC membership is composed of twice as many Asian and 3 times as many Hispanic individuals. The study was approved by the institutional review board of KPSC with a waiver for the requirement of informed consent.

### Prior herpes simplex virus infection and the risk of herpes zoster [^115Gpkoq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) has increased in the United States concurrent with decrease in herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevalence. We hypothesized that lack of HSV-elicited cross-reactive immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in an increased risk of HZ. Using specimens from the placebo arm of the Shingles Prevention Study, we investigated whether persons who develop HZ are less likely to have prior HSV infection than persons who do not develop HZ, and whether HZ is less severe in persons with HSV than in HSV seronegative persons.

Methods

We conducted a nested case-control (1:2) study comparing the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cases (persons with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HZ) to age-, sex-, and health-matched controls (persons without HZ).

Results

Sera from 639 study participants (213 cases and 426 controls) yielded definitive HSV antibody results and were analyzed. Overall, HSV seropositivity rate was 75%. HSV seronegativity was significantly higher in HZ cases than controls (30.5% vs 22.3%; p = 0.024), with a 55% higher risk of HZ in HSV seronegative than HSV seropositive participants. HSV seropositivity was associated with more severe HZ (P = 0.021).

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that prior infection with HSV partly protects against HZ.

### The epidemiology of herpes zoster in immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults ≥ 50 years old: incidence, complications, hospitalization, mortality, and recurrence [^111dfVM7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ), particularly in the unvaccinated immunocompetent population, are needed to assess disease burden and the potential impact of vaccination.

Methods

The study at a large health care organization comprised: (1) incidence estimated from immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years unvaccinated with zoster vaccine live who had incident HZ in 2011–2015; (2) proportion of HZ-related nonpain complications assessed by double abstraction of electronic health records (EHRs) of 600 incident patients 2011–2015; (3) HZ-related hospitalizations among HZ patients diagnosed in 2015; (4) HZ-related death determined from automated data and EHRs; and (5) recurrent HZ identified from a cohort initially diagnosed with HZ in 2007–2008 and followed through 2016.

Results

HZ incidence rate was 9.92/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.82–10.01). Proportions of cutaneous, neurologic, and other complications were 6.40% (95% CI,1.73%-11.07%), 0.77% (95% CI, .00%-2.36%), and 1.01% (95% CI, .00%-2.93%), respectively. Only 0.86% of patients had an HZ-related hospitalization. The case-fatality rate was 0.04%. Recurrence rate was 10.96/1000 person-years (95% CI, 10.18–11.79) with 10-year recurrence risk of 10.26% (95% CI, 9.36%-11.23%).

Conclusions

These recent HZ epidemiology data among an immunocompetent, unvaccinated population measure real-world disease burden.

### Quantification of risk factors for herpes zoster: population based case-control study [^114eQKJ2]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

To quantify the effect of our assessed risk factors, we estimated the age specific absolute rate of zoster for each factor by multiplying the age specific effect estimates by the age specific rate of zoster in the general population in 2010. We estimated the age specific general population rates within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink by dividing the number of incident cases of zoster in 2010 by the total person time contribution of the population at risk in that year, which included all patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with at least one year of follow-up and no history of zoster.

We then evaluated to what extent combinations of risk factors could lead to a high risk of zoster, specifically within age groups not targeted for vaccination. We calculated the predicted risk of zoster for each person by summing the coefficients for their risk factors from the final model and multiplying their predicted odds ratio by the age specific rate of zoster in the general population. We were thus able to determine the number of cases aged under 70 but with a predicted risk of zoster equal to or higher than that of the general population aged at least 70 years (vaccination is currently offered to 70 and 79 year olds in the UK). We repeated this analysis with a 60 years age cut-off, to reflect vaccination policy from different countries. We restricted these calculations to people without severely immunosuppressive conditions.

### Evaluation of the effect of the herpes zoster vaccination programme 3 years after its introduction in england: a population-based study [^113vkUEC]. The Lancet: Public Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

In 2013, a herpes zoster vaccination programme was introduced in England for adults aged 70 years with a phased catch-up programme for those aged 71–79 years. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the first 3 years of the vaccination programme on incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in this population.

Methods

In this population-based study, we extracted data from the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel primary care network on consultations with patients aged 60–89 years for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occurring between Oct 1, 2005, and Sept 30, 2016, obtaining data from 164 practices. We identified individual data on herpes zoster vaccinations administered and consultations for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, and aggregated these data to estimate vaccine coverage and incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia consultations. We defined age cohorts to identify participants targeted in each year of the programme, and as part of the routine or catch-up programme. We modelled incidence according to age, region, gender, time period, and vaccine eligibility using multivariable Poisson regression with an offset for person-years.

Findings

Our analysis included 3·36 million person-years of data, corresponding to an average of 310 001 patients aged 60–89 years who were registered at an RCGP practice each year. By Aug 31, 2016, uptake of the vaccine varied between 58% for the recently targeted cohorts and 72% for the first routine cohort. Across the first 3 years of vaccination for the three routine cohorts, incidence of herpes zoster fell by 35% (incidence rate ratio 0·65 [95% 0·60–0·72]) and of postherpetic neuralgia fell by 50% (0·50 [0·38–0·67]). The equivalent reduction for the four catch-up cohorts was 33% for herpes zoster (incidence rate ratio 0·67 [0·61–0·74]) and 38% for postherpetic neuralgia (0·62 [0·50–0·79]). These reductions are consistent with a vaccine effectiveness of about 62% against herpes zoster and 70–88% against postherpetic neuralgia.

Interpretation

The herpes zoster vaccination programme in England has had a population impact equivalent to about 17 000 fewer episodes of herpes zoster and 3300 fewer episodes of postherpetic neuralgia among 5·5 million eligible individuals in the first 3 years of the programme. Communication of the public health impact of this programme will be important to reverse the recent trend of declining vaccine coverage.

### Incidence rate of herpes zoster ophthalmicus: a retrospective cohort study from 1994 through 2018 [^112DcNDD]. Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the incidence rate (IR) of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and differences by age, gender, race, and region from 1994 through 2018.

Design

Retrospective, observational cohort study.

Participants

Patients with a new International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Edition, codes for herpes zoster (HZ) and HZO from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 2018, in the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OptumLabs, Cambridge, MA).

Methods

OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a longitudinal, real-world data asset with de-identified administrative claims and electronic health record data, was used to identify enrollees with continuous enrollment in the database for 365 days or more. Patients with no history of HZ or HZO and a new code for HZ and HZO were counted as incident cases. The IR of HZO was calculated by year, 10-year age groups, gender, race, and region.

Main Outcome Measures

Differences in IR from 1994 through 2018 by 10-year age groups and gender.

Results

From 1994 through 2018, 633474 cases of HZ were reported, with 49745 (7.9%) having HZO. The incidence of HZO increased from 1994 through 2018 by an estimated 1.1 cases per 100000 person-years annually (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–1.3; P < 0.001). The estimated relative increase was 3.6% annually (95% CI, 3.0%-4.1%). HZO IR increased in all ages over 10 years until 2007, then began declining in individuals younger than 21 and older than 60, stabilizing in individuals 21 to 30 years old, and increasing more slowly among individuals 31 to 60 years old. Men showed an HZO incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.74 compared with women. Compared with white patients, the IRRs were 0.70, 0.75, and 0.64 for Asians, black patients, and Hispanics, respectively.

Conclusions

The incidence of HZO has increased 3.6% per year from 1994 to 2018 in the United States. Since 2008, HZO incidence declined in individuals younger than 21 years and older than 60 years while increasing at a lower rate in middle-aged adults. Given the continued increase, greater efforts should be made to vaccinate eligible adults 50 years of age and older. More research on earlier vaccination is warranted.

### Varicella [^112ANYoi]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus, a herpesvirus, causes varicella (chickenpox) and, after endogenous reactivation, herpes zoster (shingles). Varicella, which is recognised by a characteristic vesicular rash, arises mainly in young children, although older individuals can be affected. In immunocompetent patients, symptoms are usually mild to moderate, but an uncomplicated severe case can have more than 1000 lesions and severe constitutional symptoms. Serious complications — including central nervous system involvement, pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections, and death — are sometimes seen. Varicella can be prevented by vaccination. Vaccine is about 80–85% effective against all disease and highly (more than 95%) effective in prevention of severe disease. In the USA, a routine childhood immunisation programme has reduced disease incidence, complications, hospital admissions, and deaths in children and in the general population, indicating strong herd immunity. Similar immunisation programmes have been adopted by some other countries, including Uruguay, Germany, Taiwan, Canada, and Australia, and are expected to be implemented more widely in future.

### Incidence of herpes zoster amongst adults varies by severity of immunosuppression [^115hDPoa]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined the incidence of herpes zoster in immunocompromised adults (≥ 18 years) with different severities of immunosuppression and assessed the prevalence of complications and of various kinds of healthcare resource utilisation.

Methods

German claims data from more than ten million adults were used to calculate annual incidence rates of herpes zoster for the years 2006–2012 and to analyse the prevalence of complications, physician visits, hospitalisations, and antiviral and analgesic treatments using a cohort design. The analyses were stratified by age, sex, and severity of immunosuppression, defined by immunocompromising conditions and drug therapies.

Results

The incidence rate per 1000 person-years of herpes zoster was almost twice as high in immunocompromised patients (11.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4–11.6)) compared to immunocompetent subjects (5.9 (95% CI: 5.8–5.9)). The incidence rate was higher in highly immunocompromised patients (13.4 (95% CI: 13.2–13.6)) than in patients with a low severity of immunosuppression (10.0 (95% CI: 9.8–10.1)). These differences were observed for both sexes and in all age groups. Complications, outpatient physician visits, hospitalisations, and analgesic treatments occurred more frequently in immunocompromised patients as well.

Conclusions

Our results show that immunocompromised individuals are affected by the disease in particular and that the burden of herpes zoster is highest in severely immunocompromised patients.

### The epidemiology of herpes zoster in immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults ≥ 50 years old: incidence, complications, hospitalization, mortality, and recurrence [^115Q1PH8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The incidence rates of HZ are presented in Table 1. The incidence rate measured using diagnostic codes was 9.92 (95% CI, 9.82–10.01) per 1000 person-years. It generally increased with age, from 7.20/1000 person-years in the 50–54 years group to 13.99/1000 person-years in the ≥ 80 years group. There were 26 545 out of 1 360 248 (1.95%) cohort members who became immunosuppressed during the follow-up period. Among the 26 545 members, 909 went on and developed HZ. Two of the 909 cases were HZ-related death. Accounting for censoring when individuals became immunosuppressed during follow-up resulted in minimal change in the incidence estimate (9.82 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 9.72–9.91). Overall, 85% of the incident HZ diagnoses had antiviral medications. The incidence rate of HZ defined by diagnostic codes plus antiviral medications was 8.40 (95% CI, 8.31–8.49) per 1000 person-years, increasing from 6.21/1000 person-years in the 50–54 years group to 11.61/1000 person-years in the ≥ 80 years group.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^1153TgqS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, also known as 'shingles', is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and it can significantly compromise the quality of life of affected individuals. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus for clinical use among older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine has also been tested. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This new vaccine is not yet available for clinical use.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

For this 2015 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1948 to the 3rd week of October 2015), EMBASE (2010 to October 2015), CINAHL (1981 to October 2015) and LILACS (1982 to October 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also performed 'Risk of bias' assessment.

Main Results

We identified 13 studies involving 69,916 participants. The largest study included 38,546 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries and included only healthy Caucasian individuals ≥ 60 years of age without immunosuppressive comorbidities. Ten studies used live attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccines. Three studies tested a new type of vaccine not yet available for clinical use. We judged five of the included studies to be at low risk of bias. The incidence of herpes zoster, at up to three years of follow-up, was lower in participants who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56, risk difference (RD) 2%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of mild to moderate intensity adverse events. These date came from one large study that included 38,546 people aged 60 years or older. A study including 8122 participants compared the new vaccine (not yet available) to the placebo; the group that received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years of follow-up: RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.10, RD 3%, NNTB 33; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events but most them were of mild to moderate intensity. All studies received funding from the pharmaceutical industry.

Authors' Conclusions

Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease and this protection can last three years. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. There are studies of a new vaccine (with a VZV glycoproteic fraction plus adjuvant), which is currently not yet available for clinical use.

### Risk factors for herpes zoster: should people with asthma or COPD be vaccinated? [^117LsgQq]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is present in > 95% of adults ≥ 40 years of age. The lifetime risk of shingles is > 30% in those not vaccinated against HZ. Even with highly efficacious vaccines now available, HZ and its complications are a significant cause of morbidity, with an estimated 1 million cases per year in the United States.

Before vaccination programs, complications of HZ were reported in almost 1 in 4 patients with HZ. The most common complication is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), which can significantly impact quality of life for months or years. It occurs in 5–30% of all HZ cases, with risk increasing with age; 80% of all PHN cases occur in those ≥ 50 years of age. HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) is the second most common complication of HZ, occurring in up to 10% of cases and may lead to severe outcomes such as blindness.

Many risk factors for HZ have been identified, including age, sex, family history of zoster, race, immunocompromised conditions (transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], malignancies, and autoimmune diseases), and multiple chronic conditions. Increasing age is the leading risk factor for both HZ and PHN and is attributed to immunosenescence of cell-mediated immunity, specifically to the VZV. Ageing and many chronic conditions can compromise the immune system.

Having chronic conditions or comorbidity increases a person's risk of developing HZ. On average, there is a 30% increased risk of acute HZ in those with at least one of the following conditions: asthma, chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), depression and rheumatoid arthritis. Both asthma and COPD have also been associated with an increased risk of PHN.

### The temporal impact of aging on the burden of herpes zoster [^111inXXy]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of Herpes Zoster (HZ) increases with age and various studies have also demonstrated an increasing HZ incidence globally. Simultaneously, the global trend of an aging population has placed a greater burden on the healthcare system. This study aims to estimate the potential burden of HZ over time accounting for the increasing trends of both HZ incidence and global aging.

Methods

A recent systematic review on HZ incidence identified studies that evaluated the temporal effects of HZ incidence. Data from the identified studies were extracted to estimate the trend of HZ incidence in the ≥ 65-year-old age cohort. The incidence rates were estimated up to the year 2030 using two scenarios: a linear extrapolation and a last observation carried forward. Three countries were chosen to perform the analysis on: Australia, Japan and the United States.

Results

The incidence data from the three countries showed an average annual increase between 2.35 and 3.74% over the time period of the studies selected. The elderly population for the US, Japan and Australia are expected to increase by 55, 10 and 53% respectively by the year 2030 compared to the levels in 2015. Under the first scenario between 2001 and 2030, the number of annual incident cases of HZ in those aged ≥ 65 years is expected to increase by +343% (293,785 to 1,303,328), +176% (158,616 to 437,867) and +376% (18,105 to 86,268) in the US, Japan and Australia respectively while those for the second scenario are +150%, +83% and +223% respectively. In the US alone, the estimated annual cost of HZ-related cases in the ≥ 65 age cohort is approximately 4.74 Billion US$ in 2030.

Conclusions

The increasing incidence of HZ coupled with the demographic trends (i.e., aging population and greater life expectancy) in many countries are likely to imply a rising economic burden of HZ on already constrained healthcare budgets.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^111rgbBx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The UK zoster vaccine cost‐effectiveness analysis estimates that among those aged > 65 years with zoster, 2·0% are hospitalized and 0·06% die; this is in line with our study, which estimates that (among patients with zoster aged ≥ 50 years) 1·3% are hospitalized and 0·06% die. A study in Germany using a health insurance database containing nationwide routine outpatient data found that 4·1% of immunocompetent patients with zoster (age ≥ 50 years) developed zoster encephalitis, zoster meningitis and zoster with other complications. A US population‐based study using administrative data supplemented by medical review reported that 3·7% of 859 cases of zoster experienced a non‐PHN complication; those of older age and with certain comorbidities (including inflammatory bowel disease, HIV and diabetes) were more likely to experience complications. A recent study among 600 immunocompetent unvaccinated patients with zoster (age ≥ 50 years), selected from a large healthcare organization in the USA, found that the proportions of cutaneous, neurological and other complications were higher than in our study, at 6·40%, 0·77% and 1·01%, respectively; however, our estimates fall inside their CIs. This latter study assessed for non‐PHN complications by medical chart review, which may have led to a higher proportion of complications than in our study.

We found that patients with zoster aged < 50 years had a greater relative risk of developing complications than patients ≥ 50 years of age. This is likely because the baseline rate of such complications in younger populations is much lower. However, overall the absolute risks of complications were lower in patients under, compared with over, 50 years of age.

This is the first large‐scale UK‐based epidemiological study examining the risk of non‐PHN complications of zoster using routinely collected health data. Collectively, rarer zoster complications together mean that around one in 20 patients with zoster will develop a complication beyond PHN. Highlighting the risk of complications to the general public may help increase the uptake of shingles vaccination, as qualitative research has shown that the perceived severity of a disease influences individuals' decisions about whether or not to vaccinate; greater perceived harm due to the infectious agent is associated with higher vaccine uptake.

### About shingles (herpes zoster)… [^112HxoJU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- About 1 in every 3 people in the United States will have shingles in their lifetime.
- Shingles can sometimes lead to serious complications like long-term nerve pain and vision loss.
- The best way to protect yourself from shingles is vaccination. What it is Shingles is a painful rash illness. People get shingles when the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies after they have already had chickenpox. An estimated 1 million people get shingles each year in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their life. However, you can have shingles more than once. Who is at risk More than 99% of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common. Your risk of shingles and serious complications increases:

- As you get older.
- If you have medical conditions that keep your immune systems from working properly such as certain cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, and HIV infection.
- If you take drugs that keep your immune system from working properly, like steroids and drugs given after an organ transplant. Causes and spread Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles. People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus through: Prevention Protect yourself with the vaccine. CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy.

Keep Reading: Shingles Vaccine Recommendations.
- Cover the rash
- Avoid touching or scratching the rash
- Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds
- Avoid contact with the following people until your rash scabs over
- Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine
- Premature or low birth weight infants
- People with weakened immune systems
- Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine.

### Incidence of herpes zoster among children vaccinated with varicella vaccine in a prepaid health care plan in the United States, 2002–2008 [^1163E4qN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus after a primary infection with either wild-type or vaccine-type varicella-zoster virus, the latter having been introduced in 1995 for children. Since then, few population-based data about the incidence of childhood HZ are available.

Methods

We identified children aged ≤ 12 years who were vaccinated with 1 dose of varicella vaccine between 2002 and 2008 in a prepaid health plan and followed them through their electronic health records for a diagnosis of HZ. The medical records of these children were reviewed. Persistent and chronic conditions for these children before HZ were identified.

Results

There were 172,163 children vaccinated, with overall follow-up of 446,027 person-years (Incidence rate = 27.4 per 100,000 person-years, 95% confidence interval: 22.7–32.7). Children vaccinated after age 5 years had a higher but not statistically significant different rate than children vaccinated between 12 and 18 months (34.3 vs. 28.5 per 100,000 person-years). Among children vaccinated between 12 and 18 months, incidence rates gradually increased each year in the first 4 years after vaccination (P < 0.001). Among the HZ cases, there were 1 (0.7%) case of lymphoid leukemia, 1 (0.7%) case of drug abuse, 16 (11.1%) cases of asthma with 3 or more acute exacerbations, 12 (8.3%) cases of developmental disorders, and 3 (2.1%) cases of psychological or mental disorders.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that diagnosed HZ is rare among children following varicella vaccine. Despite the small numbers, the roles of delayed vaccination, severe asthma, and development disorders warrant further investigation. In the future, analyses of HZ isolates will be needed to identify the virus strains causing reactivation.

### Increasing incidence of herpes zoster over a 60-year period from a population-based study [^115dN4P3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Temporal increases in the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) have been reported but studies have examined short study periods, and the cause of the increase remains unknown. We examined the long-term trend of HZ.

Methods

A population-based cohort study was conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using data from 1945–1960 and 1980–2007. Medical records review of possible cases was performed to confirm incident cases of HZ, the patient's immune status, and prescribing of antivirals for HZ. We examined the relative change in the temporal trend in the incidence rates before and after the introduction of the varicella vaccination program.

Results

Of the 8017 patients with HZ, 58.7% were females and 6.6% were immunocompromised. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of HZ increased from 0.76 per 1000 person-years (PY) (95% confidence interval [CI].63-.89) in 1945–1949 to 3.15 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 3.04–3.26) in 2000–2007. The rate of increase across the time period was 2.5% per year after adjusting for age and sex (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.025 [95% CI, 1.023–1.026]; P < .001). The incidence of HZ significantly increased among all age groups and both sexes. We found no change in the rate of increase before vs after the introduction of the varicella vaccination program.

Conclusions

The incidence of HZ has increased > 4-fold over the last 6 decades. This increase is unlikely to be due to the introduction of varicella vaccination, antiviral therapy, or change in the prevalence of immunocompromised individuals.

### Do the health-care workers gain protection against herpes zoster infection? A 6-year population-based study in Taiwan [^116zR3RG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella, and may reactivate to cause herpes zoster later in the life of the host. It has been previously observed that exposure to VZV may boost the host's latent immunity. Health-care workers who are frequently exposed to ill patients ought to receive a protective effect. We investigated the incidence of herpes zoster among health-care workers and the general population in Taiwan to see whether such a protective effect exists among health-care workers against herpes zoster. This nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study was based on data obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. In total, 7744 health-care workers, including 168 dermatologists and pediatricians, and 695 188 general adults were recruited for the study. Health-care workers in the age groups 20–29, 30–39 and 40–49 years were found to have a significant higher herpes zoster incidence compared to the general adults (P < 0.001, 0.011 and < 0.001, respectively). Both logistic regression and Cox regression showed that dermatologists, pediatricians, and other medical professionals have a higher herpes zoster incidence than the general population (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.63–2.90, hazards ratio [HR] = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.64–2.82 in dermatologist and pediatrician groups, and OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.23–1.58, HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.22–1.56 in other medical professionals). The incidence of herpes zoster is higher among health-care workers and it can be clearly concluded that no protective effect against herpes zoster exists for health-care workers in Taiwan.

### Famciclovir [^113hudYL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)

Two randomized, double-blind trials, 1 placebo-controlled and 1 active-controlled, were conducted in 964 immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated herpes zoster. Treatment was initiated within 72 hours of first lesion appearance and was continued for 7 days.

In the placebo-controlled trial, 419 patients were treated with either famciclovir 500 mg three times daily (n = 138), famciclovir 750 mg three times daily (n = 135) or placebo (n = 146). The median time to full crusting was 5 days among famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients as compared to 7 days in placebo-treated patients. The times to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and loss of crusts were shorter for famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients in the overall study population. The effects of famciclovir were greater when therapy was initiated within 48 hours of rash onset; it was also more profound in patients 50 years of age or older. Among the 65.2% of patients with at least 1 positive viral culture, famciclovir treated patients had a shorter median duration of viral shedding than placebo-treated patients (1 day and 2 days, respectively).

There were no overall differences in the duration of pain before rash healing between famciclovir-and placebo-treated groups. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of pain after rash healing (postherpetic neuralgia) between the treatment groups. In the 186 patients (44.4% of total study population) who developed postherpetic neuralgia, the median duration of postherpetic neuralgia was shorter in patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg than in those treated with placebo (63 days and 119 days, respectively). No additional efficacy was demonstrated with higher dose of famciclovir.

In the active-controlled trial, 545 patients were treated with 1 of 3 doses of famciclovir three times daily or with acyclovir 800 mg five times daily. Times to full lesion crusting and times to loss of acute pain were comparable for all groups and there were no statistically significant differences in the time to loss of postherpetic neuralgia between famciclovir and acyclovir-treated groups.

### Herpes zoster presentation, management, and prevention: a modern case-based review [^116f7459]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common cutaneous entity with protean clinical presentations, management options, complication rates, and prevention strategies, all of which are rife with dogma. During an inpatient consultation for HZ, have you ever been approached by a frantic staff or family member, worried that a pregnant, elderly, or infant contact will be 'infected' if they get too close? Have your patients ever asked you about their risk of having HZ twice, or claimed that they have frequent 'recurrences'? In what timeline should antiviral therapy be employed? Is there evidence for prednisone or gabapentin in acute HZ treatment? Who should be vaccinated against HZ and what are the benefits and risks? In case-based form, these and other complex but common scenarios will be examined using clinical and viral mechanistic clues, along with updated treatment and prevention guidelines, to provide a modern HZ case management compendium, comprehensive of the diverse age and health populations now presenting with this condition.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1159keZf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus epidemiology — incidence, seroprevalence, and transmission: Prior to the universal administration of varicella vaccine, approximately 4 million cases of varicella occurred annually in the United States, the annual incidence in children aged < 10 years was 9%, and by adulthood > 95% of individuals had antibodies to VZV; in the United States the incidence of varicella and its associated morbidity and mortality have decreased by ≥ 88% because of universal vaccination, and clinical infection develops in about 80% of susceptible individuals exposed to VZV within a household.

Historic herpes zoster incidence trends in US adults have been hard to interpret. Using administrative databases, we extended previous descriptions of these trends through 2016. We observed an age-specific transition, with ongoing increases among younger adults but deceleration in older adults. The patterns are not readily explained.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^114JvMqd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The USA Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus, live zoster vaccine (LZV), for clinical use amongst older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), has also been approved. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last updated in 2016.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

For this 2019 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, January 2019), MEDLINE (1948 to January 2019), Embase (2010 to January 2019), CINAHL (1981 to January 2019), LILACS (1982 to January 2019), WHO ICTRP (on 31 January 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov (on 31 January 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine (any dose and potency) versus any other type of intervention (e.g. varicella vaccine, antiviral medication), placebo, or no intervention (no vaccine). Outcomes were incidence of herpes zoster, adverse events (death, serious adverse events, systemic reactions, or local reaction occurring at any time after vaccination), and dropouts.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 11 new studies involving 18,615 participants in this update. The review now includes a total of 24 studies involving 88,531 participants. Only three studies assessed the incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan. Fifteen studies used LZV. Nine studies tested an RZV. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Most data for the primary outcome (incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-quality evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6) of mild to moderate intensity (moderate-quality evidence). These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or over. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-quality evidence). There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that there symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All of the other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV and RZV are effective in preventing herpes zoster disease for up to three years (the main studies did not follow participants for more than three years). To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity.

### Herpes zoster and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease [^1135WuKj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the longitudinal association of herpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as "shingles", and long‐term risk of stroke or coronary heart disease (CHD) among participants in 3 large US cohorts, the NHS (Nurses' Health Study), NHS II (Nurses' Health Study II), and HPFS (Health Professionals Follow‐Up Study).

Methods and Results

Participants were 79 658 women in the NHS (2000–2016), 93 932 women in the NHS II (2001–2017), and 31 440 men in the HPFS (2004–2016), without prior stroke or CHD. Information on HZ, stroke, and CHD was collected on biennial questionnaires and confirmed by medical record review. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios for stroke and for CHD according to years since HZ compared with never HZ. During > 2 million person‐years of follow‐up, 3603 incident stroke and 8620 incident CHD cases were documented. History of HZ was significantly and independently associated with higher long‐term risk of stroke and CHD. In pooled analyses, compared with individuals with no history of HZ, the multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for stroke were 1.05 (0.88–1.25) among those with 1 to 4 years since HZ, 1.38 (1.10–1.74) for among those with 5 to 8 years since HZ, 1.28 (1.03–1.59) among those with for 9 to 12 years since HZ, and 1.19 (0.90–1.56) among those with ≥ 13 years since HZ. For CHD, the corresponding multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 1.13 (1.01–1.27) for 1 to 4 years, 1.16 (1.02–1.32) for 5 to 8 years, 1.25 (1.07–1.46) for 9 to 12 years, and 1.00 (0.83–1.21) for ≥ 13 years.

Conclusions

HZ is associated with higher long‐term risk of a major cardiovascular event. These findings suggest there are long‐term implications of HZ and underscore the importance of prevention.

### Key points… [^111upqMD]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Who is at risk People who had chickenpox can get shingles. About 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop herpes zoster during their lifetime. Most people have only one episode, but herpes zoster can recur. A person's risk for herpes zoster and related complications, including hospitalizations, sharply increases after 50 years of age. The reasons why VZV reactivates and causes herpes zoster are not well understood. About 30% of people hospitalized with herpes zoster have compromised or suppressed immune systems. Other potential risk factors for herpes zoster have been identified, but the findings are inconsistent or unexplained. For example:

- More women than men develop shingles.
- Herpes zoster is less common in black people than in white people. Disease rates An estimated one million cases of herpes zoster occur annually in the United States. The incidence of herpes zoster varies by age and is approximately two to nine cases per 1, 000 US population annually.

The precise incidence of recurrence is not known. Death rates One study estimated 96 deaths occur each year where herpes zoster was the underlying cause. Almost all of the deaths were in older adults or those with weakened immune systems. Prevention CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy. Varicella vaccines contain live attenuated VZV, which results in latent infection. Although herpes zoster has always been uncommon among children, the rate in U. S. children has declined since the routine varicella vaccination program started in 1995.
- Children vaccinated against varicella have lower rates of herpes zosterwhen compared to children who had natural infection with varicella.

Trends Previously, herpes zoster rates in the United States gradually increased over a long period. We don't know the reason for that increase. Recently, herpes zoster rates across age groups have recently plateaued or declined. CDC studies have found that rates started increasing before the varicella vaccine was introduced in the United States; and did not accelerate after the routine varicella vaccination program started.

### Evaluation of the effect of the herpes zoster vaccination programme 3 years after its introduction in england: a population-based study [^111A54t7]. The Lancet: Public Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2013, a herpes zoster vaccination programme was introduced in England for adults aged 70 years with a phased catch-up programme for those aged 71–79 years. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the first 3 years of the vaccination programme on incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in this population.

Methods

In this population-based study, we extracted data from the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel primary care network on consultations with patients aged 60–89 years for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occurring between Oct 1, 2005, and Sept 30, 2016, obtaining data from 164 practices. We identified individual data on herpes zoster vaccinations administered and consultations for herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, and aggregated these data to estimate vaccine coverage and incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia consultations. We defined age cohorts to identify participants targeted in each year of the programme, and as part of the routine or catch-up programme. We modelled incidence according to age, region, gender, time period, and vaccine eligibility using multivariable Poisson regression with an offset for person-years.

Findings

Our analysis included 3·36 million person-years of data, corresponding to an average of 310001 patients aged 60–89 years who were registered at an RCGP practice each year. By Aug 31, 2016, uptake of the vaccine varied between 58% for the recently targeted cohorts and 72% for the first routine cohort. Across the first 3 years of vaccination for the three routine cohorts, incidence of herpes zoster fell by 35% (incidence rate ratio 0·65 [95% 0·60–0·72]) and of postherpetic neuralgia fell by 50% (0·50 [0·38–0·67]). The equivalent reduction for the four catch-up cohorts was 33% for herpes zoster (incidence rate ratio 0·67 [0·61–0·74]) and 38% for postherpetic neuralgia (0·62 [0·50–0·79]). These reductions are consistent with a vaccine effectiveness of about 62% against herpes zoster and 70–88% against postherpetic neuralgia.

Interpretation

The herpes zoster vaccination programme in England has had a population impact equivalent to about 17000 fewer episodes of herpes zoster and 3300 fewer episodes of postherpetic neuralgia among 5·5 million eligible individuals in the first 3 years of the programme. Communication of the public health impact of this programme will be important to reverse the recent trend of declining vaccine coverage.

### The epidemiology of herpes zoster in immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults ≥ 50 years old: incidence, complications, hospitalization, mortality, and recurrence [^1172m1UT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Data on the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ), particularly in the unvaccinated immunocompetent population, are needed to assess disease burden and the potential impact of vaccination.

Methods

The study at a large health care organization comprised: (1) incidence estimated from immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years unvaccinated with zoster vaccine live who had incident HZ in 2011–2015; (2) proportion of HZ-related nonpain complications assessed by double abstraction of electronic health records (EHRs) of 600 incident patients 2011–2015; (3) HZ-related hospitalizations among HZ patients diagnosed in 2015; (4) HZ-related death determined from automated data and EHRs; and (5) recurrent HZ identified from a cohort initially diagnosed with HZ in 2007–2008 and followed through 2016.

Results

HZ incidence rate was 9.92/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.82–10.01). Proportions of cutaneous, neurologic, and other complications were 6.40% (95% CI,1.73%–11.07%), 0.77% (95% CI,.00%–2.36%), and 1.01% (95% CI,.00%–2.93%), respectively. Only 0.86% of patients had an HZ-related hospitalization. The case-fatality rate was 0.04%. Recurrence rate was 10.96/1000 person-years (95% CI, 10.18–11.79) with 10-year recurrence risk of 10.26% (95% CI, 9.36%–11.23%).

Conclusions

These recent HZ epidemiology data among an immunocompetent, unvaccinated population measure real-world disease burden.

### Evaluation of the effect of the herpes zoster vaccination programme 3 years after its introduction in england: a population-based study [^111FmWAb]. The Lancet: Public Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Uptake in the participating practices was similar to that reported nationally. Coverage was similar for men and women, except for the catch-up cohorts in the first 2 years of the programme, when coverage was about 5–6% higher in men. Coverage varied by 10% across regions (data not shown).

We included more than 3·35 million person-years of data for individuals aged 60–89, from Oct 1, 2005, to Sept 30, 2016, in the analysis of impact. The unadjusted rates show initial evidence of lower incidence in the vaccine-eligible cohorts than in those ineligible, higher rates in women than in men and in participants outside of London than those in London, and increases with age (table 2). We then modelled the incidence data to estimate the impact. After the fitting process, the final model only included the variable to measure impact (vaccine eligibility), a log-linear time trend (a 0·8% increase per year), and a quadratic age effect (with incidence increasing from 5·9 per 1000 person-years at age 60 years to a peak of 9·9 at age 83 years, then a slight decline to 9·7 by age 89 years — higher than previously reported in the UK). Region, month, and gender, although associated with herpes zoster incidence, were not confounders (vaccine impact estimates changed by < 1%) and we identified no significant interactions (data not shown). The model with factors for age and period gave similar results, as did the random effects model.

The first year of the programme (2013–14) saw a decline in the observed incidence of herpes zoster for routine and catch-up cohorts, whereas incidence in other cohorts showed a general increasing trend over time as the cohorts aged (figure 2). In the second year (2014–15), the decline in incidence in those eligible for vaccination in the first year improved as coverage improved. A decline in incidence was also observed in the third year (2015–16) for the additional routine cohort targeted in the second year — ie, those aged 69 years in Sept 1, 2013 — as well as in the catch-up cohort of those aged 77 years on Sept 1, 2013, but the decline reversed for those aged 78 years on Sept 1, 2013. In the third year, the decline seen in the first routine cohort continued, but was reversed in the first catch-up cohort.

### Shingles facts and stats… [^112zASwt]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- 1 in 3 people in the United States develop shingles at least once.
- Fewer than 100 people die of shingles each year.
- Risk increases with age and in people who have weakened immune systems. Highlights About 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop shingles in their life. Your risk of having shingles increases as you get older or if you have a weakened immune system. Most people who have shingles only have it one time. However, you can have shingles more than once. The most common complication of shingles is severe pain in the area where the shingles rash occurred. This is known as postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN. Approximately 10% to 18% of people with herpes zoster will get PHN. The risk of PHN also increases with age. Did you know. U. S. data Hospitalizations Approximately 1 to 4% of people with shingles go to the hospital for complications.

Older adults and people with weakened or suppressed immune systems are more likely to need to go to the hospital. About 30% of people in the hospital for shingles have a weakened or suppressed immune system. Deaths Fewer than 100 people die from shingles each year. Almost all shingles deaths are in older adults or people with compromised immune systems.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on adult immunizations as part of cardiovascular care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112RMjqn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Zoster (shingles) vaccination — cardiovascular associations, benefits, and adult recommendations are presented. Infection with herpes zoster is known to induce an inflammatory state with increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), and those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are more likely to have zoster infection. Multiple observational studies have found reduced cardiovascular events among patients vaccinated for herpes zoster; in a South Korea study of over 1 million individuals, zoster vaccination was significantly associated with reduced MI, stroke, heart failure (HF), and arrhythmia, and this benefit lasted for 8 years post-vaccination. Randomized data indicate that patients with coronary artery disease receive as good or greater effectiveness from vaccination compared with those with other chronic conditions. The current national recommendations for zoster vaccination are that all adults aged ≥ 50 years should receive 2 doses of the zoster (shingles) vaccine separated by 2 to 6 months.

### Herpes zoster and tofacitinib therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^113dePmo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), also known as herpes zoster (HZ) or shingles, is of substantial public health importance, as up to one-third of adults in the US will develop HZ within their lifetime. Nearly 100% of individuals in the US age 40 years or older have been exposed to this virus, and its reactivation is related to diminished VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity associated with increasing age and immunosuppressive conditions. Among patients who develop HZ, postherpetic neuralgia occurs in ∼15%, causing long-term disability. More rarely, disseminated forms of HZ occur, potentially leading to encephalitis and death. In the US, the annual incidence rates (IRs) of HZ vary between 0.4 and 1.1 per 100 patient-years in patients ages 50–80 years, with the highest rates seen in women. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the risk of HZ is elevated 2–3-fold.

Although certain disease-modifying therapies, such as anti–tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) therapies, have been linked to further increases in risk, studies evaluating this have produced conflicting results. To date, only prednisone has been consistently shown to increase the risk of shingles by an additional 1.5–2-fold. Furthermore, although disseminated HZ is much more common in immunosuppressed populations, it is unclear whether RA and/or its disease-modifying therapies increase the risk.

Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA. Tofacitinib preferentially inhibits JAK-3 and/or JAK-1, modulating the immune response via down-regulation of several cytokines (e.g. interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and 21) that are integral to lymphocyte development and function. Given its mechanism of action and the increased baseline risk of HZ among patients with RA, an increased risk of HZ is a theoretical concern. Accordingly, we undertook a retrospective evaluation of HZ cases as reported within the Tofacitinib RA Development Program, with the objectives of describing the outcomes of and identifying risk factors for HZ among tofacitinib-treated patients, as well as evaluating the relative incidence of HZ in tofacitinib-treated patients as compared with those receiving placebo.

### National and state-specific shingles vaccination among adults aged ≥ 60 years [^111AznhQ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shingles (herpes zoster) causes substantial morbidity, especially among older adults. The shingles vaccine has been recommended for people aged ≥ 60 years since 2006. This study assessed recent shingles vaccination at national and state levels among adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Methods

The 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were analyzed in 2015 to assess shingles vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥ 60 years at national and state levels. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal models identified factors independently associated with vaccination.

Results

Shingles vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥ 60 years was 31.8% (95% CI = 31.4%, 32.2%). Among states, shingles vaccination coverage ranged from 17.8% (95% CI = 15.8%, 20.0%) in Mississippi to 46.6% (95% CI = 44.3%, 48.8%) in Vermont, with a median of 33.3%. Coverage was < 25% in four states and > 40% in nine states. For all states, coverage was significantly higher among non-Hispanic whites compared with non-white races except for Oregon, with coverage differences ranging from -33.2% in the District of Columbia to 0.9% in Oregon and a median of -16.0%. Characteristics independently associated with vaccination were age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, employment status, household income, region, perceived health status, health insurance status, personal healthcare provider, routine checkup status, and whether reporting that cost was a barrier to seeing a doctor.

Conclusions

Coverage varied dramatically by state. State-level comparisons may aid in designing tailored intervention programs through sharing of best practices. Strategies are needed to mitigate financial barriers for both provider and patients, improve awareness, and increase provider recommendation of the vaccine.

### Herpes zoster risk after 21 specific cancers: population-based case-control study [^116pF3B2]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Some studies considering history of zoster as a risk factor for malignancies (i.e. the opposite temporality) have found positive associations suggesting that the common-cause hypothesis is one valid explanation. The temporal variation of zoster odds after diagnosis indicates that something about the malignancy, rather than only a common cause (immunodeficiency) leads to an increased zoster risk, as immunodeficiency might be expected to be constant or deteriorate with time/age rather than recover spontaneously. For most malignancies, zoster odds ratio decreased with time, perhaps as an increasing proportion of surviving patients become cancer-free and are no longer being treated with potent immunosuppression. This finding also indicates that zoster vaccination of cancer patients might be most beneficial quite soon after diagnosis, if safety and effectiveness can be confirmed in this setting. The current, live zoster vaccine is contraindicated among the profoundly immunosuppressed, but efforts are underway to develop a subunit vaccine that could be useful among these patients. One previous study found a constantly increased zoster rate after malignancy diagnosis, whereas another found a pattern similar to our study.

The decreasing malignancy-zoster association with increased age may be due to absence of other zoster risk factors and/or more aggressive chemotherapy among the young. These findings are consistent with previous studies.

Generalisability

As the study population is broadly representative of a high-income country, and the findings are congruent with studies from similar settings, the findings are likely to be generalisable to high-income countries. However, changes in cancer treatments, and the increasing popularity of immune-modulating cancer therapies mean that the associations we have observed between some cancers and zoster risk may change in the future.

### The epidemiology of herpes zoster in immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults ≥ 50 years old: incidence, complications, hospitalization, mortality, and recurrence [^116eteAf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

(.)

Before the licensure and broad uptake of a live varicella vaccine, most of the US population experienced primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). As the primary infection resolves, the virus establishes latency in dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (HZ). Zoster vaccine live (ZVL) has been recommended since 2006 for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years. Prior to the availability of ZVL, HZ affected nearly 1 million people in the United States annually. A new recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) containing VZV glycoprotein-E and the AS01 B adjuvant showed high efficacy and acceptable safety in phase 3 clinical trials and was licensed in 2017. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended to preferentially administer RZV to individuals aged ≥ 50 years, regardless of history of HZ or prior vaccination with ZVL.

Population-based data on the epidemiology of HZ in adults, especially those who are immunocompetent and who have not received zoster vaccination, are needed in order to better understand the present burden of disease, as well as to critically evaluate the potential impact of an RZV vaccination program. We have previously reported on the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) in an integrated health care organization. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to estimate the incidence of HZ, the proportion of HZ-related complications, the proportion of HZ patients that require hospitalization, HZ case-fatality rate, and HZ recurrence rate, among an immunocompetent and ZVL-unvaccinated population aged ≥ 50 years.

### Risk of herpes zoster in adults immunized with varicella vaccine [^113jpFim]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A program of routine varicella vaccination of children 12–18 months of age, begun in the United States in 1995, has been very successful in reducing the incidence of varicella. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), in both wild-type and live attenuated forms, is notable for its ability to produce latent infection of sensory neurons from which it can later reactivate to cause herpes zoster (HZ). Therefore, the effects of vaccination on this secondary VZV-related disease are important to consider; in practice, however, such studies are complicated by the typically long delay between acquisition of the virus and its reactivation. Studies of immunocompromised children have shown that vaccination is relatively protective against HZ in this highly vulnerable group. We now present long-term follow-up data on a group of individuals who received varicella vaccine as healthy young adults 10–26 years ago and who have been followed prospectively by means of active surveillance. Among some 2000 person-years of follow-up, 2 cases of HZ have occurred, for a rate of 1.00 case/1000 person-years. Overall, the incidence of HZ in this cohort, therefore, is similar to published data for the US population in the prevaccine era.

Concise clinical guidance use and scope — Shared decision-making should be utilized to ensure optimal patient care decisions are made, and these decisions should jointly reflect patient preference and those of the managing clinician, especially in areas of management uncertainty. This CCG does not supersede good clinical judgment, and the clinician should seek input as needed from relevant experts. Although this CCG focuses on respiratory vaccinations, the writing committee acknowledges emerging evidence suggesting that other vaccines — such as the herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine — may offer cardiovascular protective benefits. This CCG is based on the best data currently available, with new information to inform guidance being rapidly generated; these updates will influence the considerations presented in the document, and it is essential that clinicians stay current with emerging evidence and updates following the publication of this CCG.

### Vaccination strategies for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^113KRPZV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster disease and its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia, are associated with significant morbidity in the elderly. The zoster vaccine boosts cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes both varicella and herpes zoster. This vaccine has demonstrated the ability to reduce the zoster-related burden of illness and the incidence of both zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in a randomized, controlled trial conducted in individuals aged 60 years and older, an age group at increased risk of herpes zoster. Widespread use of this vaccine could prevent as many as a quarter of a million cases of zoster disease each year. The design and outcomes of the Shingles Prevention Study, which examined the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, and the rationale for widespread immunization against varicella-zoster virus, are presented here.

### Increasing incidence of herpes zoster among veterans [^117UtJWd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of herpes zoster in the United States has been estimated to be ≥ 1 million cases annually, with a higher rate in adults older than 60 years. The morbidity of the disease, including postherpetic neuralgia, imposes significant effects on quality of life. We analyzed reports of herpes zoster in the Veterans Affairs (VA) population because these patients are older and could provide a reflection of disease trends in the aging US population. These data will provide a baseline for future analyses of the incidence of herpes zoster after the introduction of the herpes zoster vaccine in late 2007.

Methods

To evaluate the trend in the annual incidence of herpes zoster for fiscal year 2000 (beginning October 1999) through fiscal year 2007 (through September 2007), we derived incidence rates using the Veterans Health Administration Decision Support System reports of herpes zoster by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes from 2000 through 2007 and the corresponding denominator data for all veterans in care. These rates were validated by review of medical records of patients with diagnoses of herpes zoster at the Atlanta VA Medical Center.

Results

The annual incidence of herpes zoster increased from 3.10 episodes per 1000 veterans in 2000 to 5.22 in 2007 (R² = 0.9743; P < .001). This increasing rate was seen in both men and women but only in groups older than 40 years.

Conclusion

The increasing incidence of herpes zoster in our veteran population and its effect on the quality of life of the veterans validate the need for improved rates of vaccination in this population.

### Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of herpes zoster [^112mzZLs]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

The primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection results in chickenpox (varicella), which is transmitted via the airborne route. VZV is highly infectious, but in the USA the incidence of varicella has been reduced by 76–87% as a result of the varicella vaccine. The virus establishes latency in the dorsal root ganglia during varicella and, when reactivated, travels along the sensory nerve axons to cause shingles (herpes zoster [HZ]). There are over 1 million cases of HZ in the USA each year, with an estimated lifetime attack rate of 30%. The incidence of HZ, which causes significant morbidity, increases with age and reaches approximately 10 cases per 1,000 patient-years by age 80. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is known to decline with age as part of immunosenescence, and decreased CMI is associated with reactivation of VZV. This article provides an overview of our emerging understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of varicella and HZ, in addition to exploring the current theories on latency and reactivation. Understanding the risk factors for developing HZ and the complications associated with infection, particularly in older people, is important for prompt diagnosis and management of HZ in primary care, and they are therefore also reviewed.

### No consistent evidence of decreased exposure to varicella-zoster virus among older adults in countries with universal varicella vaccination [^116hNQAo]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human alphaherpesvirus that infects most individuals, usually during childhood, although its incidence may be delayed in warmer climates. Primary infection with VZV produces varicella (chickenpox), which is usually a benign disease. VZV remains latent in neurons and may reactivate symptomatically later in life, causing herpes zoster (shingles). The risk of developing herpes zoster increases steeply with age once individuals reach 50 years; other risk factors for herpes zoster include sex, ethnicity, and immunosuppression. While the incidence of herpes zoster is lower than that of varicella, it is frequently associated with potentially debilitating complications such as postherpetic neuralgia and uveitis, generating a considerable aggregate health and economic burden.

In 1965, Hope-Simpson hypothesized that VZV reactivation is under an immunological control that is periodically boosted by exposures to varicella (ie, exogenous boosting) and/or by prior subclinical VZV reactivation events (ie, endogenous boosting). The exact nature of the immunological mechanisms that mediate protection against herpes zoster continues to remain elusive. Therefore, with current knowledge, protective boosting cannot be demonstrated using any specific immunological measures. However, an increase in any VZV-related immunological outcome, irrespective of its protective effect against herpes zoster, provides proof that the immune apparatus has encountered VZV and has been stimulated (ie, has experienced a subclinical reinfection). Conversely, no increase of any immunological measure raises the possibility that the immune system has not been sufficiently exposed to VZV, meaning that exogenous boosting could not have occurred either. Thus, measurements of immunological outcomes can provide important information on the adequacy of VZV exposure.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^114oxE9t]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What recommendations are being reviewed?

Since 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine vaccination of all persons aged ≥ 60 years with 1 dose of herpes zoster vaccine.

Why are the recommendations being reviewed now?

After approval by the Food and Drug Administration for use of zoster vaccine in adults aged 50 through 59 years in 2011, ACIP initially considered use of the vaccine among adults in this age group, but declined to change its recommendations at that time, citing shortages of Zostavax and limited data on long-term protection afforded by herpes zoster vaccine. A new review was conducted because the manufacturer has resumed routine supply of Zostavax and additional data on long-term protection have become available.

What is currently recommended?

Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP's recommendation remains unchanged; herpes zoster vaccine is routinely recommended only for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Because the protection offered by the herpes zoster vaccine wanes within the first 5 years after vaccination, and duration of protection beyond 5 years is uncertain, it is unknown to what extent persons vaccinated before age 60 years will be protected as they age and their risk for herpes zoster and its complications increases. Because duration of protection offered by the vaccine is uncertain, the need for revaccination is not clear. Assuming waning of vaccination protection according to currently available studies, the cost-effectiveness model projects a substantially greater reduction of disease burden, health care utilization, and costs with vaccination of older adults who have higher incidence of herpes zoster and related complications. Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP maintained its current recommendation that herpes zoster vaccine be routinely recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

### What does epidemiology tell us about risk factors for herpes zoster? [^113TRkKD]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus as herpes zoster is thought to result from waning of specific cell-mediated immunity, but little is known about its determinants in individuals with no underlying immunosuppression. We systematically reviewed studies of zoster epidemiology in adults and analysed data from a large morbidity study to identify factors that might be modulated to reduce the risk of zoster. Annual zoster incidence in population-based studies varied from 3.6–14.2/10³ in the oldest individuals. Risk factors identified in analytical studies that could explain this variation included age, sex, ethnicity, genetic susceptibility, exogenous boosting of immunity from varicella contacts, underlying cell-mediated immune disorders, mechanical trauma, psychological stress, and immunotoxin exposure. Our review highlights the lack of information about risk factors for zoster. We suggest areas of research that could lead to interventions to limit the incidence of zoster. Such research might also help to identify risk factors for age-related immune decline.

### Incidence and time trends of herpes zoster in rheumatoid arthritis: a population-based cohort study [^111xdEEX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence, time trends, risk factors, and severity of herpes zoster in a population-based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to a group of individuals without RA from the same population.

Methods

All residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota fulfilling for the first time the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 2007 and a cohort of similar residents without RA were assembled and followed by retrospective chart review until death, migration, or December 31, 2008.

Results

There was no difference in the presence of herpes zoster prior to the RA incidence/index date between the cohorts (P = 0.85). During followup, 84 patients with RA (rate 12.1 cases per 1,000 person-years) and 44 subjects without RA (rate 5.4 cases per 1,000 person-years) developed herpes zoster. Patients with RA were more likely to develop herpes zoster than those without RA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.7–3.5]). Herpes zoster occurred more frequently in patients diagnosed with RA more recently (HR 1.06 per year [95% CI 1.02–1.10]). Erosive disease, previous joint surgery, and use of hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids were significantly associated with the development of herpes zoster in RA. There was no apparent association of herpes zoster with the use of methotrexate or biologic agents. Complications of herpes zoster occurred at a similar rate in both cohorts.

Conclusion

The incidence of herpes zoster is increased in RA and has risen in recent years. There also has been an increasing incidence of herpes zoster in more recent years in the general population. RA disease severity is associated with the development of herpes zoster.

Herpes Zoster Vaccination Coverage

In 2013, 24.2% of adults aged ≥ 60 years reported receiving herpes zoster vaccination to prevent shingles, an increase from the 20.1% reported in 2012 (Table 1). Whites aged ≥ 60 years had higher herpes zoster vaccination coverage (27.4%) compared with blacks (10.7%) and Hispanics (9.5%).

### The risk and prognosis of cancer after hospitalisation for herpes zoster: a population-based follow-up study [^1163FJ2c]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The expected number of cancers was calculated on the basis of Danish national incidence rates for primary cancers according to gender, age, and calendar time in 5-year intervals. Multiplying the number of person-years under observation by the appropriate cancer incidence rates yielded the number of cancers that would be expected if patients with herpes zoster had the same risk of cancer as that of the general population. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the standardised incidence ratio – that is, the relative risk, calculated as the ratio of observed to expected cancers – were based on the assumption that the observed number of cases in a specific category follows a Poisson distribution. We examined the association between herpes zoster and all cancer types combined, as well as the association between herpes zoster and haematological cancers, cancers associated with immunosuppression, and other cancers.

Through the Danish Cancer Registry, we obtained information on the extent of cancer spread among the herpes zoster patients who developed cancer during follow-up (cases). The extent of spread was divided into 'no spread', 'regional spread', and 'distant metastases'. We calculated the prevalence ratio of distant metastases (the proportion of cases with distant metastases divided by the proportion of controls with distant metastases) and an associated 95% CI.

We used proportional hazards regression analyses to compare the risk of death after a cancer diagnosis for cases relative to that for controls. We did separate analyses on cases with haematological cancer and those with other types of cancer. The comparisons were based on estimation of mortality ratios and associated 95% CI. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata software (Stata Corporation, Texas, USA).

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^116sBK98]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster risk in IBD — epidemiology and medication associations shows elevated incidence and drug-related risks. In the general population, about one in three persons develop zoster during their lifetime, and as many as 10–18% develop post‑herpetic neuralgia. In a cohort study, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease had higher zoster incidence than controls (UC incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05–1.40; CD IRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35–1.92), and corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.1–2.2) and azathioprine/6‑mercaptopurine (adjusted odds ratio, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.7–5.6) were associated with zoster. In a large administrative database, 590,232 CD, 56,403 UC, and 1,269 unspecified IBD cases were matched to 434,416 non‑IBD individuals, with increased zoster risk in IBD (IRR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.60–1.76) and higher risk after adjustment (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.42–1.57); anti‑TNF (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.48–2.21), corticosteroids (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.51–1.99), and thiopurines (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.61–2.13) were independently associated, with the highest risk for combination anti‑TNF plus thiopurine therapy (OR: 3.29, 95% CI: 2.33–4.65).

### Review of the persistence of herpes zoster vaccine efficacy in clinical trials [^111es85q]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine(*) was approved for the prevention of shingles in 2006. Initial Phase III clinical trials proved vaccine efficacy persisted during the study duration; however, assessment of long-term efficacy required additional studies. This article reviews efficacy data for the zoster vaccine that have been published since 2004. It focuses on studies assessing declining vaccine efficacy.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were searched for zoster vaccine efficacy trials. Randomized controlled trials published from 2004 to 2015 were included in the review.

Findings

Six studies were included in the review. The zoster vaccine reduced the risk of herpes zoster by 51.3% to 72.4% in 2 Phase III trials. Primary and other analyses showed the vaccine was effective at reducing the burden of illness (61.1%), postherpetic neuralgia (66.5%), disease interference on functional status (66.2%), and disease impact on health-related quality of life (55%) compared with placebo. Surveillance studies showed a decrease in vaccine efficacy for reducing the incidence of herpes zoster during follow-up years 3.3 to 7.8 (39.6% relative reduction) and 4.7 to 11.6 (21.1% relative reduction).

Implications

Initial zoster vaccine efficacy is significant, but declines in post-vaccination years 3 to 11. This raises the question about the need for possible revaccination with the zoster vaccine. Clinicians should consider the declining efficacy when administering the zoster vaccine to patients. Future studies will need to address the impact of the varicella vaccine on the incidence of shingles and whether this impacts the efficacy of the zoster vaccine.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112msmvB]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diseases — epidemiology in adults with HIV: More than 95% of adults (aged > 20 years) born in the United States have immunity to VZV, and a varicella vaccine became available in the United States in 1995; most children born in the United States after 2005 are immune to varicella as a result of vaccination. In the general population, the incidence of herpes zoster is about 3.6 cases per 1,000 person-years. Before the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of herpes zoster was more than 15-fold higher among adults with HIV than among age-matched controls without HIV. Herpes zoster can occur at any CD4 T lymphocyte count, but with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm³ the risk is higher, and HIV viremia is associated with an increased risk for incident herpes zoster. ART has been shown to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster in adults with HIV, although the risk remains threefold higher than in the general population, and the risk is increased in the 6-month period immediately after initiation of ART.

### Varicella-zoster virus reactivation and the risk of dementia [^116U6XUr]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus that establishes lifelong latency in humans. VZV reactivation is associated with a wide range of symptoms, including herpes zoster (HZ; also known as shingles), and has been implicated in the development of dementia, although to an unknown extent. Here we present a large-scale longitudinal analysis of health records from more than 100 million individuals in the United States that demonstrates a consistent relationship of VZV reactivation with dementia after controlling for nearly 400 measured characteristics (covering demographics, socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, medications, proxies for healthcare-seeking behavior, shifts in clinical guidelines and completeness of records). We found that recurrent HZ was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared to a single HZ episode. Additionally, exposure to HZ vaccines was associated with a reduced risk of dementia compared to the control 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Furthermore, the reduced risk of dementia after administration of the live-attenuated zoster vaccine waned over time and was highly correlated with a waning of the vaccine-mediated protection against HZ. The dementia risk reduction at 3 and 5 years postexposure was also stronger in individuals who received multiple as opposed to only one dose of the recombinant HZ vaccine and those at greater risk of HZ. Our findings strongly implicate VZV reactivation as a modifiable risk factor for dementia.

Ascertainment of HZ ("Shingles")

Information on history of "shingles" (HZ) and the date it occurred was collected on the 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 NHS questionnaires, the 2001, 2005, 2013, and 2017 NHS II questionnaires, and the 2004, 2006, and 2008 HPFS questionnaires. Participants were asked about clinician‐diagnosed "shingles" and the year of diagnosis. To confirm the validity of self‐report in our participants, we mailed a supplemental questionnaire to 99 NHS women that asked for permission to obtain medical records relating to the diagnosis of shingles, which were reviewed by a physician investigator (G.C.C.). The diagnosis of HZ was confirmed in 97%, demonstrating that self‐reported diagnosis of shingles (HZ) in this cohort of nurses is highly reliable. Notably, the participants in all 3 of our cohorts are health care professionals, and the reliability of health‐related information collected from our participants has been demonstrated for a large number of health outcomes. The primary exposure for this study was categorized according to time (in years) since the participant's HZ event. Those with no history of HZ were the referent group.

Ascertainment of Stroke

Stroke was classified as total stroke, encompassing ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, confirmed by physician review of medical records according to criteria specified in the National Survey of Stroke, requiring evidence of a sudden or rapid onset of neurologic deficit that persisted for > 24 hours or until death. Participants who reported a nonfatal stroke on a biennial questionnaire were asked for permission to review their medical records. Deaths were reported by next of kin or postal authorities or determined by systematic searches of the National Death Index, and permission for medical records was sought. Our group previously reported that 98% of the deaths in each cohort are ascertained. Cases of nonfatal stroke that were confirmed by letter/interview but lacked sufficient medical documentation were considered probable stroke. We considered both stroke confirmed by medical record review and probable stroke as cases in our analyses.

### Effects of varicella vaccination on herpes zoster incidence [^112DqEA6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The effects of a general varicella vaccination programme on the incidence of herpes zoster are of major public health importance. This review focuses on two key aspects, namely the relationship between wild-type virus spread and the incidence of herpes zoster, as obtained from recent surveys, surveillance and observational studies, and the results from mathematical population models. Although knowledge is limited, close contact with varicella cases seems to have a protective effect. Thus, an increase in zoster incidence after varicella immunisation is possible, but the extent is unknown because of the influence of other factors independent of immunisation. Currently, vaccination effects estimated from mathematical modelling depend strongly on pre-specified assumptions. In order to obtain more precise predictions, the results of ongoing monitoring and clinical studies are awaited and further studies are suggested. Vaccination recommendations can be adapted at any time to take account of further findings in this area.

### Herpes zoster vaccine and the incidence of recurrent herpes zoster in an immunocompetent elderly population [^116sNVWm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of vaccinating immunocompetent patients who have had shingles has not been examined. The study assessed the association between vaccination and the incidence of herpes zoster recurrence among persons with a recent episode of clinically diagnosed herpes zoster.

Methods

This is a matched cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Study populations were immunocompetent elderly individuals ≥ 60 years old with a recent episode of herpes zoster. Incidence of recurrent herpes zoster was compared between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated matched cohorts.

Results

A total of 1036 vaccinated and 5180 unvaccinated members were included. On the basis of clinically confirmed cases, the incidence of recurrent herpes zoster among persons aged < 70 years was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI].02–5.54) and 2.20 (95% CI, 1.10–3.93) cases per 1000 person-years in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.39 (95% CI, .05–4.45) among persons aged < 70 years and 1.05 (95% CI, .30–3.69) among persons aged ≥ 70 years.

Conclusions

The risk of herpes zoster recurrence following a recent initial episode is fairly low among immunocompetent adults, regardless of vaccination status. Such a low risk suggests that one should evaluate the necessity of immediately vaccinating immunocompetent patients who had a recent herpes zoster episode.

### The incidence of herpes zoster in a United States administrative database [^113nVxQK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Few recent studies have reported data on the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) in U.S. general clinical practice.

Objective

To estimate the age- and sex-specific incidence of HZ among U.S. health plan enrollees.

Design

Data for the years 2000 to 2001 were obtained from the Medstat MarketScan database, containing health insurance enrollment and claims data from over 4 million U.S. individuals. Incident HZ cases were identified through HZ diagnosis codes on health care claims. The burden of HZ among high-risk individuals with recent care for cancer, HIV, or transplantation was examined in sub-analyses. Overall incidence rates were age- and sex-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population.

Participants

MarketScan U.S. health plan enrollees of all ages.

Measurements and Main Results

We identified 9,152 incident cases of HZ (3.2 per 1,000 person-years) (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1 to 3.2 per 1,000). Annual HZ rates per 1,000 person-years were higher among females (3.8) than males (2.6) (P < .0001). HZ rates rose sharply with age, and were highest among individuals over age 80 (10.9 per 1,000 person-years) (95% CI, 10.2 to 11.6). The incidence of HZ per 1,000 person-years among patients with evidence of recent care for transplantation, HIV infection, or cancer (10.3) was greater than for individuals without recent care for these conditions (3.0) (P < .0001).

Conclusions

The overall incidence of HZ reported in the present study was found to be similar to rates observed in U.S. analyses conducted 10 to 20 years earlier, after age- and sex-standardizing estimates from all studies to the 2000 U.S. population. The higher rate of HZ in females compared with males contrasts with prior U.S. studies.

### Quantification of risk factors for herpes zoster: population based case-control study [^111J8Brd]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster (commonly known as shingles) is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus when specific cell mediated immunity becomes compromised. It is a common disease in older people, with a lifetime risk of up to 30% rising to 50% among those living to 85 years. Zoster typically presents as a painful unilateral vesicular dermatomal rash that causes acute morbidity lasting two to four weeks. A severe complication — postherpetic neuralgia — although uncommon in patients aged under 50, develops in 12% of zoster patients aged 50 years or over; it causes intense pain that can last from months to years and is associated with considerable impairment of quality of life.

A live vaccine that reduces the risk of zoster and postherpetic neuralgia has recently been developed. The vaccine is licensed in peoople aged over 50 years. In the United States and Australia, it is recommended in people aged 60 years or over. In the United Kingdom, it is routinely available for patients aged 70, with a catch-up campaign for 72–79 year olds (on the basis of cost effectiveness studies); the current catch-up cohort is those aged 79. Table 1shows some examples of recommedations on vaccination in major countries. As the zoster vaccine is expensive, targeting vaccination towards groups at high risk of zoster is necessary. Age is the most important risk factor for zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, so it drives vaccination policies. The incidence of zoster rises from 3.5 per 1000 person years among 50–54 year olds to 7.1 per 1000 person years among 75–79 year olds in the UK. However, whether people with other risk factors, particuarly in younger age groups, might also benefit from vaccination is not clear.

### Shingles facts and stats… [^114Mbn5U]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- 1 in 3 people in the United States develop shingles at least once.
- Fewer than 100 people die of shingles each year.
- Risk increases with age and in people who have weakened immune systems. Highlights About 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop shingles in their life. Your risk of having shingles increases as you get older or if you have a weakened immune system. Most people who have shingles only have it one time. However, you can have shingles more than once. The most common complication of shingles is severe pain in the area where the shingles rash occurred. This is known as postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN. Approximately 10% to 18% of people with herpes zoster will get PHN. The risk of PHN also increases with age. U. S. data Hospitalizations Approximately 1 to 4% of people with shingles go to the hospital for complications. Older adults and people with weakened or suppressed immune systems are more likely to need to go to the hospital.

About 30% of people in the hospital for shingles have a weakened or suppressed immune system. Deaths Fewer than 100 people die from shingles each year. Almost all shingles deaths are in older adults or people with compromised immune systems.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diseases — epidemiology in adults with HIV indicates that more than 95% of adults (aged > 20 years) in the United States have VZV immunity, and in the general population the incidence of herpes zoster is about 3.6 cases per 1,000 person-years. Before antiretroviral therapy (ART), herpes zoster incidence was more than 15-fold higher among adults with HIV than among age-matched controls, and herpes zoster can occur at any CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count with higher risk at CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm³. HIV viremia is associated with increased risk, and although ART has been shown to reduce incidence, the risk remains three-fold higher than in the general population; several studies have also demonstrated an increased risk in the 6-month period immediately after ART initiation, possibly related to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^117CzzMk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster arises from the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus following reduced cell‐mediated immunity. Zoster is typically mild and self‐limiting, but complications can occur. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), pain at the site of the original zoster rash, which persists beyond rash healing. Risk factors for zoster and PHN include older age and reduced cell‐mediated immunity. As well as PHN, serious cutaneous, visceral, neurological and ocular complications can occur. Some lead to severe illness, high healthcare costs and mortality, while others can seriously affect quality of life.

Despite their potential seriousness, our knowledge of the frequency of, and risk factors for, such zoster complications is limited. Previous studies have typically been small and restricted to hospital‐diagnosed cases of zoster within limited age groups. Larger cohort studies have not included a comparison group without zoster or have not examined risk factors for the complications.

Accurate quantification of the burden of rare but severe complications and their risk factors, and the effectiveness of antiviral medications could help inform zoster vaccine policy decisions and clinical decisions regarding antiviral therapy. We therefore aimed to quantify the relative and absolute risks of acute complications of zoster within 3 months of diagnosis and to assess whether these risks varied by age, among unvaccinated immunocompetent adults. We also sought to assess whether antiviral drugs prescribed during acute zoster modify the risks of these complications.

### Herpes zoster: epidemiology, natural history, and common complications [^114xRcRe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is a disease associated with aging that can significantly impair quality of life for affected individuals. Anyone infected with varicella (chickenpox) virus in childhood is at risk for reactivation of dormant virus and the onset of zoster disease, although it occurs with increasing frequency in the elderly as a result of waning of cell-mediated immunity. The most common complication of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia, which can cause chronic and debilitating pain. Current treatments can decrease the severity of zoster rash and pain but cannot prevent disease onset or completely eliminate the most frequent symptoms. The zoster vaccine may help prevent the onset of herpes zoster in the target population of those age 60 years and older. This summary reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, natural history, and common symptoms of zoster disease.

### Understanding the immunology of the zostavax shingles vaccine [^115SWwdk]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Zostavax is a live-attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine recommended for use in adults > 50 years of age to prevent shingles. The main risk factor for the development of shingles is age, which correlates with decreasing cell-mediated immunity. These data suggest a predominant role of T cell immunity in controlling VZV latency. However, other components of the immune system may also contribute. In this review, we will discuss how the immune system responds to Zostavax, focusing on recent studies examining innate immunity, transcriptomics, metabolomics, cellular, and humoral immunity.

### Papulovesicular lesions near the right breast [^112h1fhd]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is most commonly associated with the development of these lesions?
A. Surgery and radiation therapy
B. Breast cancer
C. Infection
D. Older age
E. Immunocompromised state

Answers:
A. Surgery and radiation therapy – Correct. Surgery and radiation therapy for malignancy are the most common causes of ACL. Pathogenesis involves the destruction of previously normal lymphatics. The congestion and resulting superficial lymphatic dilation manifest as the lesions of ACL, which have been reported to develop as late as 25 years after the causative factor.
B. Breast cancer – Incorrect. Breast cancer is the most common cause of carcinoma telangiectodes and is the most common cause of cutaneous metastases in women.
C. Infection – Incorrect. Infection-related complications (eg, tuberculosis-associated scarring)have been associated with ACL, but they are not a common cause. However, rupture of ACL lesions can create a portal of entry for bacteria, and this can give rise to complications such as cellulitis.
D. Older age – Incorrect. Older age is a risk factor for developing shingles, which is most common in individuals over the age of 50.
E. Immunocompromised state – Incorrect. Immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk for the development of shingles and viral warts, which are lesions that ACL may mimic.

Question 3: Which is an appropriate option for the management of this patient's lesions?
A. Wide local excision
B. Oral antivirals
C. Chemotherapy
D. Oral antibiotics
E. Observation

Answers:
A. Wide local excision – Incorrect. This is an option for Stewart-Treves syndrome, though the prognosis remains poor given the disease's aggressive course.
B. Oral antivirals – Incorrect. This is the treatment for uncomplicated herpes zoster.
C. Chemotherapy – Incorrect. This would be an option for treating an underlying primary malignancy such as breast cancer.
D. Oral antibiotics – Incorrect. This patient does not have an infection, though topical mupirocin may be used to prevent superinfection of any ruptured ACL lesions.
E. Observation – Correct. ACL lesions are generally stable, chronic, asymptomatic, and do not require treatment. Treatment options that have been reported with varying efficacies include cryotherapy, electrodessication, laser therapy, surgical excision, and sclerotherapy.

### The temporal impact of aging on the burden of herpes zoster [^1169P7Vm]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

To estimate the expected number of cases up to year 2030 for both scenarios, the corresponding predicted value of incidence for each year was multiplied by the projected population estimate for same year. Population data and projections for the ≥ 65 year old age cohort up to 2030 were obtained from United Nations World Population Prospects: the 2015 revision. The medium fertility variant population projection was used which takes into account a medium fertility, normal mortality and normal international migration rates.

Although annual incidence rates were presented for 11 studies, we focused on three studies as they reported the annual incidence data specifically for the ≥ 65 age group while also reporting incidence over a sufficiently long time period so as to perform linear best fit curve. The studies used to estimate the incidence rates were Leung et al. Toyama et al. and MacIntyre et al. which reported HZ incidence rates for the US, Japan and Australia respectively and was adjudged to present a reasonable picture of the expected HZ burden in high-income country setting. For the US, both Leung et al. and Hales et al. evaluated the incidence rates for the ≥ 65 immunocompetent and overall population, but for our analysis we conservatively considered the former (note the incidence was consistently lower than rates reported in Hales et al.) as the yearly incidence data was readily available from the study Leung et al. estimated the HZ incidence using a retrospective cohort study of medical claims data from the MarketScan (Truven Health Analytics) databases for 1993–2006. The MarketScan database is convenience sample that includes patient-level information from over 100 self-insured employers, state governments, hospitals, health insurance plans and Medicare from all states in the United States of America. HZ incidence (stratified by age and sex) was calculated using all persons with a first outpatient service associated with a 053.xx code (HZ International Classification of Diseases: ICD-9 code) as the numerator, and total MarketScan enrollment as the denominator. We did not include incidence data reported by Leung et al. from 1993–1996 in our analysis as the MarketScan data during this period did not include Medicare data which represents the bulk of the US population aged 65 and above.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^1113G3D4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) epidemiology in children with HIV — HZ reactivation occurs in approximately 30% of people who had varicella; among children with HIV it was very common before antiretroviral therapy (approximately 10 cases/100 patient-years prior to 1996) and remains at 2 to 3 cases/100 patient-years in the ART era, which is 10 to 25 times higher than in the general population. Risk factors include low incident or nadir CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count/percentage, high HIV viral load, and acquisition of varicella when the CD4 percentage is < 15%; recurrence frequency increases inversely with the CD4 count and incidence increases with age, particularly in individuals aged > 50 years. In countries with varicella vaccination programs many children with HIV received the licensed varicella vaccine, and varicella vaccination is associated with a decrease in HZ in children without HIV and likewise in vaccinated children with HIV compared with those who had wild-type infection.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^111UBfjk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster or, as it is commonly called, 'shingles' is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox, which is latent in the dorsal spinal ganglia when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition which can often last for many weeks or months, impairing the patient's quality of life. The natural aging process is associated with a reduction of cellular immunity which predisposes to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production, therefore avoiding viral reactivation. A herpes zoster vaccine with an active virus has been approved for clinical use among older adults by the Food and Drug Administration and has been tested in large populations.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources for relevant studies: CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7, MEDLINE (1948 to July week 1, 2012), EMBASE (2010 to July 2012), LILACS (1982 to July 2012) and CINAHL (1981 to July 2012). We also reviewed reference lists of identified trials and reviews for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also carried out an assessment of risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs with a total of 52,269 participants. Three studies were classified at low risk of bias. The main outcomes on effectiveness and safety were extracted from one clinical trial with a low risk of bias. Four studies compared zoster vaccine versus placebo; one study compared high-potency zoster vaccine versus low-potency zoster vaccine; one study compared refrigerated zoster vaccine versus frozen zoster vaccine; one study compared live zoster vaccine versus inactivated zoster vaccine and one study compared zoster vaccine versus pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (pneumo 23). Confirmed cases of herpes zoster were less frequent in patients who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56), with a risk difference (RD) of 2%, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 50. Analyses according to age groups indicated a greater benefit in participants aged 60 to 69 years, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.45) and in participants aged 70 years and over, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.75). Vaccine-related systemic adverse effects were more frequent in the vaccinated group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.57, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 100). The pooled data risk ratio for adverse effects for participants with one or more inoculation site adverse effect was RR 4.51 (95% CI 2.35 to 8.68), and the NNTH was 2.8 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.4). Side effects were more frequent in younger (60 to 69 years) than in older (70 years and over) participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease. Although vaccine benefits are larger in the younger age group (60 to 69 years), this is also the age group with more adverse events. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse effects of mild to moderate intensity.

### Risk of recurrent herpes zoster in a population-based cohort study of older adults [^111L8SVW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data on zoster recurrence.

Objective

To examine in detail zoster recurrence in a population-based cohort.

Methods

Using data from a large cohort (The 45 and Up Study) with linked medical data (2004–2015), the incidences of first and recurrent zoster were examined by using survival analysis methods.

Results

Over 1,846,572 person-years of follow-up, of 17,413 participants who had a first zoster episode (incidence, 9.43 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval, 9.29–9.57), 675 (3.9%) experienced a recurrence. The mean time between first and recurrent zoster was 2 years for those aged 45–54 years and 3 years for those aged 55 years and older. Among those with a first zoster, the incidence of recurrence was 11.05 (95% confidence interval, 10.24–11.91) per 1000 person-years, and higher recurrence incidence occurred in women compared to men, in younger compared to older participants, and in immunosuppressed compared to nonimmunosuppressed participants. Recurrence appeared lower in the 12 months after zoster onset but then remained consistent at approximately 12.00 per 1000 person-years in the following 8 years.

Limitations

Recurrence may be underestimated because of the use of administrative data for case ascertainment. Potential misclassification of nonimmunosuppressed participants.

Conclusions

Our results support the vaccination of people who have already experienced zoster and underpin the need for additional studies on immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy in these populations.

### The effect of vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella zoster virus [^1142PtSD]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox (varicella) on primary exposure and can reactivate later in life to cause shingles (zoster). As primary infection is more serious in adults than children, and exposure to the virus might boost the immune response to both chickenpox and shingles, there are two main concerns regarding infant VZV vaccination: that it could lead to an increase in adult disease; and/or that it could lead to a temporary increase in the incidence of shingles. This paper reviews the evidence for such outcomes. The consensus view of mathematical modelling studies is that the overall varicella associated burden is likely to decrease in the long term, regardless of the level of vaccine coverage. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that an increase in zoster incidence appears likely, and the more effective vaccination is at preventing varicella, the larger the increase in zoster incidence. Targeted vaccination of susceptible adolescents and/or the contacts of high-risk individuals can be effective at preventing disease in these individuals with minimal risk to the community. However, targeted strategies would not prevent most disease (including most severe disease), and will not lead to a long-term reduction in the incidence of zoster. Understanding the mechanisms for maintaining immunity against varicella and zoster is critical for predicting the long-term effects of vaccination. Meanwhile sensitive surveillance of both chickenpox and shingles is essential in countries that have implemented, or are about to implement, varicella vaccination.

### Shingles vaccination of U.S. adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years before recommendations for use of recombinant zoster vaccine [^112hFC36]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2006, zoster vaccine live was recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. In 2011, zoster vaccine live was approved for use but not recommended for adults aged 50–59 years. This study assessed zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years.

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 National Health Interview Surveys were analyzed in 2019 to estimate national zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years. State-specific zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years was assessed using 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data.

Results

Among adults aged 50–59 years, zoster vaccine live coverage was 5.7% in 2017, ranging from 4% to 6% during 2013–2017 (test for trend, p > 0.05). Zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged 50–59 years ranged from 5.8% in Pennsylvania to 14.7% in South Dakota. By 2017, zoster vaccine live was received by 34.9% of adults aged ≥ 60 years, a significant increase from 24.2% in 2013. Zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 60 years in 2017 ranged from 26.0% in Mississippi to 51.8% in Vermont. In 2017, major characteristics significantly associated with increased likelihood of zoster vaccine live vaccination among adults aged 50–59 years and ≥ 60 years were older age, having 4 to 9 physician contacts in the past 12 months, and having a usual place for health care.

Conclusions

This study provides an assessment of zoster vaccine live coverage among adults aged ≥ 50 years before the newly recommended recombinant zoster vaccine came into widespread use. Providers should routinely assess adults' vaccination status and strongly recommend or offer needed vaccines to their patients.

Varicella‑zoster virus (VZV) in immunosuppressed patients — serostatus and risk of zoster or dissemination: VZV is one of the 2 most frequent herpesviruses to cause cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed patients, and between 65% and 70% of adult patients are seropositive for VZV. Herpes zoster occurs most frequently during the first year following chemotherapy treatment or following receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or a solid organ transplant (SOT). Depending on the intensity of treatment or type of transplant, 25%–45% develop dermatomal zoster, with a 10%–20% risk of developing dissemination without prompt and effective antiviral therapy.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^114T2VXY]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Herpes zoster can cause rare but serious complications; the frequency of these complications has not been well described.

Objectives

To quantify the risks of acute non‐postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) zoster complications, to inform vaccination policy.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study among unvaccinated immunocompetent adults with incident zoster, and age‐, sex‐ and practice‐matched control adults without zoster, using routinely collected health data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (years 2001 to 2018). Crude attributable risks of complications were estimated as the difference between Kaplan–Meier‐estimated 3‐month cumulative incidences in patients with zoster vs. controls. We used Cox models to obtain hazard ratios for our primary outcomes in patients with and without zoster. Primary outcomes were ocular, neurological, cutaneous, visceral and zoster‐specific complications. We also assessed whether antivirals during acute zoster protected against the complications.

Results

In total 178 964 incident cases of zoster and 1 799 380 controls were included. The absolute risks of zoster‐specific complications within 3 months of zoster diagnosis were 0·37% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·34–0·39] for Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 0·01% (95% CI 0·0–0·01) for disseminated zoster, 0·04% (95% CI 0·03–0·05) for zoster death and 0·97% (95% CI 0·92–1·00) for zoster hospitalization. For other complications, attributable risks were 0·48% (95% CI 0·44–0·51) for neurological complications, 1·33% (95% CI 1·28–1·39) for ocular complications, 0·29% (95% CI 0·26–0·32) for cutaneous complications and 0·78% (95% CI 0·73–0·84) for visceral complications. Attributable risks were higher among patients > 50 years old. Patients with zoster had raised risks of all primary outcomes relative to controls. Antiviral prescription was associated with reduced risk of neurological complications (hazard ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·53–0·70).

Conclusions

Non‐PHN complications of zoster were relatively common, which may affect cost‐effectiveness calculations for zoster vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that zoster can lead to various complications, besides PHN.

### Safety and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit candidate vaccine in HIV-infected adults: a phase 1 / 2a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^114goL87]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; commonly known as shingles) is an often debilitating disease resulting from the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. The incidence of HZ in the general population is 2.0–3.6 cases per 1000 person-years, with higher incidence rates in adults ≥ 50 years of age and in immunocompromised people, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected individuals. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays a major role in controlling VZV reactivation, and CMI in HIV-infected individuals can be substantially and persistently compromised.

Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), HZ incidence rates were 10–20 times higher in HIV-infected adults than in the age-matched general population. Since ART was introduced, HZ incidence rates have decreased to approximately 10 cases per 1000 person-years but remain 3–5 times higher than in the general population. HZ may occur at any time during HIV infection, although a low CD4 + T-cell count and an HIV RNA level of > 400 copies/mL have been associated with higher risks of HZ. Furthermore, recurrent HZ cases are more frequent in HIV-infected individuals. Similar to the incidence of HZ itself, complication rates are also higher in HIV-infected subjects than in the age-matched general population (27%–28% vs 10%–13%) and include cutaneous dissemination, chronic atypical skin lesions, or ocular and neurological complications.

### Global epidemiology of actinic keratosis in the general population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111T7R3M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common dermatological condition, and among the most common dermatological diagnoses in older populations. Although the prevalence of AK depends on demographic and environmental factors, little is known about the global context of AK.

Objectives

To provide a comprehensive and updated analysis of the global prevalence rate and incidence of AK in the general population through a systematic review and meta-analysis, and - through subgroup analyses - to identify high-risk phenotypes, demographic and lifestyle risk factors and regional variations in disease prevalence.

Methods

A systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science and Google Scholar was performed on 20 May 2022. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the quality of each study using a validated critical appraisal checklist. Epidemiological measurements (e.g. prevalence) from individual studies performed in the general population were then pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses (i.e. population age, geographical region, occupation, sex and study quality) were conducted.

Results

Of the 65 articles that made it through the full-text screening, 60 reported a point prevalence. A meta-analysis of these articles yielded an overall point prevalence of 14% [95% confidence interval (CI) 14–15]. In further analyses, the calculated prevalence rate varied depending on subgroup. The pooled incidence rate from the seven eligible studies analysed was 1928 per 100 000 person-years (PY; 95% CI -439 to 4294).

Conclusions

This comprehensive meta-analysis provides an updated global prevalence rate of AK of 14%, indicating a significant worldwide disease burden. The incidence rate of AK was found to be 1928 per 100 000 PY, emphasizing a growing public health concern. However, high heterogeneity among studies suggests that various factors influence the AK prevalence rate, necessitating further research to understand the observed differences.

### Shingles burden and trends… [^112e6JzQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Shingles Burden and Trends About 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop shingles in their life. Your risk of having shingles increases as you get older or if you have a weakened immune system. Most people who have shingles only have it one time. However, you can have shingles more than once. The most common complication of shingles is severe pain in the area where the shingles rash occurred. This is known as postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN. Approximately 10% to 18% of people with herpes zoster will get PHN. The risk of PHN also increases with age. Children can have shingles, but it is not common. Hospitalizations and Deaths Approximately 1% to 4% of people with shingles go to the hospital for complications. Older adults and people with weakened or suppressed immune systems are more likely to need to go to the hospital. About 30% of people in the hospital for shingles have a weakened or suppressed immune system. Fewer than 100 people die from shingles each year.

Almost all shingles deaths are in older adults or people with compromised immune systems. Trends Herpes zoster rates among adults in the United States gradually increased over a long period of time. We do not know the reason for this increase. However, the rates across age groups have recently plateaued or declined. *per 1, 000 person-years. † Defined as pain for 30 days or longer Source: https: //www. cdc. gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5705a1. htm.

### Family history and herpes zoster risk in the era of shingles vaccination [^111WbBEb]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster is a common mucocutaneous infection caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus previously introduced during a varicella infection. The epidemiology of the disease has changed since the approval of Zostavax(®) and the risk factors have been studied in depth.

Objectives

To further assess the possibility of family history as a risk factor for herpes zoster, determine the age of herpes zoster onset and the rate of recurrence.

Study Design

A case-control study involved 1103 acute herpes zoster patients and 523 controls.

Results

Case patients were more likely to report blood relatives with a history of herpes zoster than controls (43.5% vs. 10.5%; P < 0.001) (odds ratio for first-degree relatives, 4.44; 95% confidence interval 3.11–6.35). A dose-dependent effect was documented; risk was increased with multiple blood relatives (odds ratio, 17.15; 95% confidence interval, 7.50–39.18) compared with single blood relatives (odds ratio, 5.24; 95% confidence interval, 3.79–7.23). The mean age of herpes zoster onset was 51.7 (SD 19.0) years and the recurrence rate was 9.3%.

Conclusions

The results indicate a stronger association between herpes zoster and family history of herpes zoster than previously reported in the literature and suggest a genetic predisposition to herpes zoster may be more frequently inherited along maternal lines. A lower mean age of herpes zoster onset than previously documented in the literature is reported, which has implications for vaccine timing.

Herpes Zoster-Related Hospitalizations (2015) and Mortality (2011–2015) Among an Immunocompetent, Unvaccinated Population ≥ 50 Years Old From Kaiser Permanente Southern California

The incidence rate of recurrent HZ is presented in Table 4. Overall, the incidence rate of recurrence was 10.96 (95% CI, 10.18–11.79) per 1000 person-years. The incidence rate of recurrent HZ decreased from 12.74 (95% CI, 10.90–14.90) per 1000 person-years in the 50–54 years group to 8.92 (95% CI, 6.85–11.61) per 1000 person-years in the ≥ 80 years group. The cumulative incidence of HZ recurrence, stratified by age, is shown in Figure 1. The 10-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 11.11% (95% CI, 9.60%–12.84%), 10.37% (95% CI, 8.87%–12.11%), 9.23% (95% CI, 7.62%–11.15%), and 8.96% (95% CI, 5.79%–13.74%) for individuals aged 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years, and ≥ 80 years, respectively. Overall, the 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 2.50% (95% CI, 2.21%–2.82%), 4.77% (95% CI, 4.36%–5.23%), 6.59% (95% CI, 6.08%–7.13%), 8.03% (95% CI, 7.45%–8.66%), and 10.26% (95% CI, 9.36%–11.23%), respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves were not statistically significantly different by age group using the log-rank test (P = 0.12).

### Safety of herpes zoster vaccine in the shingles prevention study: a randomized trial [^115t1buQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent older adults. However, its safety has not been described in depth.

Objective

To describe local adverse effects and short- and long-term safety profiles of herpes zoster vaccine in immunocompetent older adults.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with enrollment from November 1998 to September 2001 and follow-up through April 2004 (mean, 3.4 years). A Veterans Affairs Coordinating Center generated the permutated block randomization scheme, which was stratified by site and age. Participants and follow-up study personnel were blinded to treatment assignments. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00007501)

Setting

22 U.S. academic centers.

Participants

38 546 immunocompetent adults 60 years or older, including 6616 who participated in an adverse events substudy.

Intervention

Single dose of herpes zoster vaccine or placebo.

Measurements

Serious adverse events and rashes in all participants and inoculation-site events in substudy participants during the first 42 days after inoculation. Thereafter, vaccination-related serious adverse events and deaths were monitored in all participants, and hospitalizations were monitored in substudy participants.

Results

After inoculation, 255 (1.4%) vaccine recipients and 254 (1.4%) placebo recipients reported serious adverse events. Local inoculation-site side effects were reported by 1604 (48%) vaccine recipients and 539 (16%) placebo recipients in the substudy. A total of 977 (56.6%) of the vaccine recipients reporting local side effects were aged 60 to 69 years, and 627 (39.2%) were older than 70 years. After inoculation, herpes zoster occurred in 7 vaccine recipients versus 24 placebo recipients. Long-term follow-up (mean, 3.39 years) showed that rates of hospitalization or death did not differ between vaccine and placebo recipients.

Limitations

Participants in the substudy were not randomly selected. Confirmation of reported serious adverse events with medical record data was not always obtained.

Conclusion

Herpes zoster vaccine is well tolerated in older, immunocompetent adults.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^117E7CsZ]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 5
Duration of pain in vaccine recipients in the Shingles Prevention Study. The graph compares vaccine recipients who developed herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN; 315/19,254 recipients) with placebo recipients who developed disease (641/19,247 recipients). Compared with placebo, Zostavax reduced PHN incidence defined as pain at different cut-off times for the duration of pain. Pain persisting at 90 days was reduced by 67%. * For the total population and the sub-groups stratified according to sex, the incidence of PHN in each treatment group (vaccine or placebo) was the weighted average of the observed incidence of PHN stratified according to age group, with weights proportional to the total number of person-years of follow-up in each age group.

In an adverse event substudy of the Shingles Prevention Study, rates of serious adverse events were higher in the vaccine group (1.9%) than in the placebo group (1.3%). Injection site reactions were more frequent among vaccine recipients than those taking placebo (48.3% versus 16.6%, respectively), but were generally mild.

The impact of vaccination on QoL was assessed in the entire study population of the Shingles Prevention Study using ZBPI and ZIQ questionnaires. Mean ZBPI and ZIQ scores, which rated the 'interference' of HZ and PHN with ADL, were used to calculate a 'severity of interference score'. For the entire study population, zoster vaccination reduced the ZBPI severity of interference by 66% (95% confidence interval; CI: 55, 74) and the ZIQ severity of interference by 68% (95% CI: 57, 77). In individuals who developed HZ, vaccination reduced the ZBPI severity of interference by 31% (95% CI: 12, 51) and the ZIQ severity of interference by 35% (95% CI: 13, 57). Zoster vaccination therefore reduced the burden of HZ-related interference with ADL by about two-thirds in a population of older adults and by about one-third in vaccine recipients who developed disease. Much of the effectiveness of the zoster vaccination was due to the prevention of HZ episodes.

### The epidemiological, clinical, and pathological rationale for the herpes zoster vaccine [^111Z7rwu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Worldwide, herpes zoster (HZ) affects millions of patients (particularly older adults) annually and causes significant suffering due to acute and chronic pain, or postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The objective of this article is to explain the rationale for the HZ vaccine by summarizing data on the epidemiology of HZ in the immunocompetent host, with a focus on recent incidence and risk factor studies; to review information on the burden of HZ; and to discuss the challenges of lessening the morbidity of the disease. The incidence and severity of HZ and PHN are highest in older adults. Given the central nervous system damage caused by HZ, the difficulty of adequately treating HZ to prevent PHN, and the intractability of PHN, the advent of the HZ vaccine appears to be a crucial innovation for preventing HZ and PHN.

### Epidemiology of herpes zoster and its relationship to varicella in Japan: a 10-year survey of 48, 388 herpes zoster cases in miyazaki prefecture [^115mBJGA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

From 1997 to 2006, a total of 48,388 patients with herpes zoster, ranging from a 3-month-old girl to a 102-year-old woman, were monitored at the 46 dermatology clinics in the Miyazaki Prefecture, which has a population of about 1.2 million. The mean herpes zoster incidence was 4.15/1,000 person-years, ranging from 1.96 to 7.84/1,000 person-years among different age groups, and the herpes zoster incidence was significantly higher in females (4.58) than in males (3.67). The incidence by age group was 1.96–2.86/1,000 person-years below the age of 50 years, and it increased to 5.23–7.84/1,000 person-years in persons 50–59 and older, with a trough in the ages 30–39, forming the small and large peaks. Females showed a significantly higher incidence than males, and the difference between the sexes was small below age 40 but greater at 40–49, 50–59, and 60–69. The incidence of herpes zoster was highest in August and lowest in winter, mirroring the prevalence of varicella. The number of herpes zoster cases at 60 years and older increased more than in the population from 1997 to 2006, and this increased incidence of herpes zoster in the 60–69 years and older, especially in females, might have raised the rate in contrast to the stable incidence below the age of 60 years. This large-scale survey clarifies the epidemiology of herpes zoster by age, gender, and season in relation to the prevalence of varicella in the Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan.

### Effectiveness of recombinant zoster vaccine in reducing herpes zoster incidence and all-cause mortality among patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a retrospective cohort study of 21, 046 individuals from triNetX U.S. collaborative network [^1141vrxu]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease primarily affecting peripheral joints symmetrically. Recent epidemiological data indicate a significant upward trend in both the prevalence and incidence of RA, with age-standardized prevalence increasing by 7.4% and incidence rising by 8.2% between 1990 and 2017. Patients with RA face an increased risk of serious infections compared to the general population, likely due to a combination of immunological dysfunction, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive therapies.

Herpes zoster (HZ), caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is one such infection of particular concern. HZ typically manifests with prodromal neuralgia followed by unilateral vesicular rash along sensory nerve distributions. It can lead to significant long-term sequelae, including post-herpetic neuralgia, increased risk of cardiovascular events, and vision impairment related to herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The global incidence of HZ is rising, imposing substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems and society. Advanced age and immunosuppression are known risk factors for HZ. Notably, patients with RA have an estimated incidence rate ratio of 1.93 for developing HZ compared to those without RA, with certain RA treatments, such as Janus kinase inhibitors, conferring additional risk.

HZ is one of the most prevalent vaccine-preventable diseases. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix; GlaxoSmithKline) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2017 for adults aged 50 or older. Clinical trials demonstrated impressive efficacy, with RZV reducing HZ incidence by 97.2% in adults 50 and older (ZOE-50) and 89.8% in those 70 and older (ZOE-70). These results established RZV as the preferred vaccine for HZ prevention in immunocompetent adults. A subset analysis of ZOE-50/70 participants with pre-existing potential immune-mediated diseases showed that RZV was 90.5% efficacious against confirmed HZ cases. However, while small studies have demonstrated RZV's immunogenicity and acceptable safety profile in patients with RA on various therapies, real-world efficacy data in this population remain limited.

### The temporal impact of aging on the burden of herpes zoster [^113Z73DD]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The increasing trend of HZ incidence may also be due to changes in other risk factors previously identified for HZ, e.g. increasing physical limitation or psychological stress. Increases could also be attributed to better diagnosis through improved access to healthcare and public awareness. This increasing trend along with the concurrent aging of the population is expected to further strain healthcare budgets. The aging population coupled with low birth rates in many countries will also result in a decline in the proportion of the working-age population. The ratios of the working working-age population (15–64 years old) to the older age group (65 and above) in the US in 2001 was 5.4 and is estimated to fall to 3.9 in 2020. A similar trend is observed for Australia and the corresponding ratios in Japan are 3.8 in 2001 to 2.1 in 2020.

A live attenuated Oka VZV vaccine which is licensed in various countries was shown to reduce HZ incidence by 51.1% (95% confidence interval, 44.2–57.6). However, vaccine efficacy was shown to reduce with age with the efficacy against HZ incidence dropping to 37.6% in those aged ≥ 70. Recent results of a phase III trial of an adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine have demonstrated a substantial improvement in vaccine efficacy in the elderly with an efficacy of 97.2 (95% confidence interval, 93.7–99.0) in subjects ≥ 50 years of age and 91.3% (95% confidence interval, 86.8–94.5) in subjects ≥ 70 years of age. The two vaccines could help reduce the future global burden of HZ on the elderly.

### Risk factors for herpes zoster: should people with asthma or COPD be vaccinated? [^112TxL2E]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Without vaccination, an estimated 1 in 3 individuals will develop herpes zoster (HZ) in their lifetime. Increased risk of HZ is attributed to impaired cell-mediated immunity, as observed in age-related immunosenescence or in individuals immunocompromised due to disease or immunosuppressive treatments. Most vaccination guidelines recommend HZ vaccination in all adults ≥ 50 years of age, although Shingrix ® was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in individuals aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk of HZ due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy, followed by approval by the European Medicines Agency for use in immunocompromised individuals aged ≥ 18 years. Chronic respiratory diseases are also risk factors for HZ. A new meta-analysis reported 24% and 41% increased risks of HZ in those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), respectively, compared with healthy controls. Asthma and COPD increase a person's risk of HZ and associated complications at any age and may be further elevated in those receiving inhaled corticosteroids. Despite the increased risks, there is evidence that HZ vaccination uptake in those aged ≥ 50 years with COPD may be lower compared with the age-matched general population, potentially indicating a lack of awareness of HZ risk factors among clinicians and patients. The 2022 Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease report recognizes that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended to vaccinate those aged ≥ 50 years against HZ, although health systems should consider the inclusion of all adults with asthma or COPD into their HZ vaccination programs. Further research into HZ vaccine efficacy/effectiveness and safety in younger populations is needed to inform vaccination guidelines.

### Evaluating the impact of moderate and severe varicella infections on Danish children under 18 years old: a comprehensive analysis from 2015 to 2023 [^114rHyRy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Varicella also known as chickenpox is a common pediatric disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It manifests as an itchy rash featuring vesicular blisters, often accompanied by mild-to-moderate fever and general malaise.VZV can assume a latent state within nerve ganglia after the primary infection and can be reactivated as herpes zoster (shingles) many years after primary infection.VZV is one of the most contagious pediatric diseases and approximately 90% of children contract the virus before reaching the age of 10. Immunity against the disease is considered lifelong.

In Denmark, varicella does not attain the status of a notifiable disease, and the disease is not part of the European surveillance portfolio managed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Consequently, there is no systematic surveillance system in place in Denmark to monitor the prevalence of varicella, rendering the precise burden of varicella disease in Denmark elusive. The annual incidence of varicella is estimated to be equivalent to the annual birth cohort, approximately 60,000 per year in Denmark, where most cases are children. While most varicella cases exhibit a mild and benign course, complications or hospitalizations are not infrequent.

Varicella is preventable by a live-attenuated vaccine. The varicella vaccination has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in impeding the onset of varicella, garnering the endorsement from the World Health Organization. The World Health Organization advocates for the consideration of varicella vaccines in countries where the disease exerts a substantial impact on public health and where there exists a potential for attaining high vaccination coverage, over 80%. Several countries have already successfully incorporated the varicella vaccine into their national immunization programs. In Denmark, varicella vaccines are currently procurable through the private market necessitating out-of-pocket expenditures.

European studies, where the vaccine is part of national immunization programs, show promising findings in the reduction of the incidence of varicella and related hospitalizations. A US study investigating the impact of the vaccine from 1993 to 2019 found a 97% reduction of varicella hospitalization for children. Noteworthy in Denmark, as in many other countries, concerns remain about the varicella vaccine. Specifically, there is apprehension about a potential age shift toward older age groups, which could lead to an increase in disease severity and elevated risk of herpes zoster later in life. Although current vaccine studies show promising benefits and encouraging evidence, its long-term effects, including potential drawbacks, remain uncertain and require further investigation to draw conclusive results.

### Social determinants of shingles vaccination in the United States [^1114Fcr4]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Only about one-third of older adults in the United States are vaccinated against shingles, contributing to approximately 1 million shingles cases annually. This study examines how sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and self-rated health are associated with shingles vaccine uptake.

Method

Data come from the 2017 wave of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, using a subset of older adults aged 60-plus (N = 208,301). Logistic regression models test (a) for associations between individual-level sociodemographic characteristics and vaccine uptake and (b) whether health behaviors and self-rated health moderate these associations.

Results

Black and Hispanic older adults have almost 50% lower odds of shingles vaccination, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Abstaining from alcohol, being employed, living with children, and having poor self-rated health are also associated with lower uptake. Unmarried (vs married) individuals have lower odds of vaccination that are explained by broad differences in health behavior.

Discussion

Our study contributes to understanding how shingles vaccination coverage systematically differs among social groups. In doing so, it provides guidance for public health interventions to increase uptake. This line of research is increasingly salient in a world facing novel virus threats and antivaccine social movements.

### Incidence and prevention of herpes zoster reactivation in patients with autoimmune diseases [^111LqKUY]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus usually occurring decades after initial exposure, and manifesting as a painful vesicular rash occurring along one or more dermatomes. Zoster incidence increases with age as cell mediated immunity against latent virus wanes. Epidemiological evidence suggests that individuals with underlying rheumatic diseases are at increased risk for zoster. It remains unclear whether this is due to immunosuppressive medications or from immune dysregulation of the underlying disease. A vaccine against zoster is available for individuals 50 years and older. Theoretical risks remain about using this live-attenuated virus vaccine in immunosuppressed individuals.

### Incidence and risk factors for herpes zoster among patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117SMPfc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

An increased risk of herpes zoster in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is hypothesized based on altered immune function, especially among patients receiving immunosuppressive medications.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study and a retrospective nested case-control study using 1988–1997 data from the General Practice Research Database. In the cohort study, 7823 Crohn's disease (CD) and 11,930 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were matched on age, sex, and primary care practice to 79,563 randomly selected controls without CD or UC. In the nested case-control study, 185 CD patients with zoster and 266 UC patients with zoster were matched on sex and year of birth to 1787 IBD patients without zoster.

Results

In the cohort study, the incidence of zoster was higher in patients with CD and UC compared with their matched controls (UC incidence rate ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.40; CD incidence rate ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35–1.92). In the nested case-control study, receipt of a prescription for corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.2) or azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7–5.6) were both associated with zoster.

Conclusions

Patients with IBD, especially those on immunosuppressive medications, are at higher risk for herpes zoster compared with the general population. Future studies should clarify the relative risk associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapies and determine the use of the new zoster vaccine for patients with IBD.

### Effectiveness of the live zoster vaccine during the 10 years following vaccination: real world cohort study using electronic health records [^112cyiYi]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The waning effectiveness of the live zoster vaccine was an important reason why the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices preferentially recommended recombinant zoster vaccine over live zoster vaccine. Given that waning was substantial, a more appropriate way to characterise vaccine effectiveness over 10 years was to describe the trajectory of vaccine effectiveness over time, rather than feature a summary measure. However, we did report summary measures of overall vaccine effectiveness to facilitate comparisons across subgroups, and comparisons with other studies. Such comparisons can be problematic because estimates of overall vaccine effectiveness are in effect weighted towards what vaccine effectiveness was earlier after vaccination rather than later, due to more follow-up being available in the early years postvaccination. To address this problem, we reported a measure we called average vaccine effectiveness, which indicates what overall vaccine effectiveness would be if all vaccinated people were followed until an outcome event or 10 years postvaccination. When vaccine effectiveness wanes, estimates of overall vaccine effectiveness can be misleading because they are higher than the average vaccine effectiveness to the extent that follow-up skews towards earlier years postvaccination.

We found that incidence rose with age whereas vaccine effectiveness decreased a little with age. Taken together, these findings suggest that the benefit of vaccination increases with age when evaluated on an absolute scale, such as the risk difference per person year. For example, although the estimated vaccine effectiveness against HZ was 6.2 percentage points lower for people aged 80 years or older than for people aged 50–59 years (table 3, 41.4% v 47.6%), incidence in the unvaccinated group was 74% higher for people aged 80 years or older (table 1, 1191.7 v 366.2 per 100 000 person years). Taken together, the risk difference per person year was substantially higher for people aged 80 years or older. In some countries, including UK and Australia, live zoster vaccine has not been recommended for people aged 80 years or older; our evidence suggests that vaccination would benefit people in this age group.
