## Question

Differential diagnosis of anemia in a neonate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step differential diagnosis and workup for neonatal anemia, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define neonatal anemia using gestational and postnatal age–specific norms. Then, I should categorize etiologies by pathophysiology and immediately prioritize life-threatening causes. Next, I will outline the initial diagnostic evaluation with CBC, indices, reticulocyte count, smear, and DAT. After that, I will map a targeted workup based on reticulocyte response and MCV, including special tests for hemolysis, blood loss, and bone marrow failure. Finally, I will consider management principles, transfusion thresholds, and follow-up, while double-checking areas where common pitfalls occur and correcting them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the definition of neonatal anemia, because misclassification here derails the entire workup. Neonatal anemia should be defined relative to gestational and postnatal age using population-based percentiles; anemia is best defined as hemoglobin below the 5th percentile for age, with moderate severity between the 1st and 5th percentile and severe below the 1st percentile, acknowledging that a 24-week preterm infant's "normal" hemoglobin is far lower than a term infant's, and that postnatal physiologic decline further shifts thresholds over the first months of life [^111mP78c]. Hold on, I should verify a common pitfall: using adult or older infant cutoffs in neonates is inappropriate; this age-specific framework avoids that error and aligns with evidence-based neonatal reference intervals [^111mP78c].

> Next, I should review the major pathophysiologic buckets to anchor the differential: blood loss, hemolysis, and decreased production. Wait, let me verify that I'm not missing a fourth bucket; in neonates, these three categories encompass the vast majority of causes and guide the initial testing strategy, so I will proceed with this triad while keeping mixed mechanisms in mind, especially hemorrhage plus hemolysis, which are underrecognized in retrospective series [^116DbepM] [^113dKkRT].

> I will now examine blood loss etiologies first because they are common and immediately actionable. Fetomaternal hemorrhage is a classic cause of severe neonatal anemia and can be confirmed with maternal testing; the Kleihauer-Betke test is traditional, but I need to check for false negatives due to ABO interference and consider adjuncts like maternal alpha-fetoprotein when FMH is suspected but KBT is negative, as illustrated by case reports and laboratory medicine guidance [^115sWDRF]. Placental abruption, umbilical cord accidents, internal hemorrhage such as intracranial, hepatic, splenic, or adrenal bleeds, and iatrogenic blood loss from frequent phlebotomy in NICU patients are all critical considerations, and I should double-check for occult hemorrhage when the history is incomplete or the infant is unstable [^113dKkRT] [^114dUjoP].

> Now, let me consider hemolysis, and I should confirm the laboratory hallmarks before listing causes. Hemolysis typically shows elevated reticulocyte count, increased LDH and indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin, with the DAT distinguishing immune from nonimmune etiologies; a peripheral smear helps identify morphologic clues such as spherocytes, schistocytes, or Heinz bodies, and the AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline explicitly calls for DAT in specified maternal scenarios and G6PD testing when jaundice escalates despite phototherapy, which I should not forget to order [^111kLtJd] [^114jDhEc] [^115sMhns]. Immune hemolysis includes Rh and ABO incompatibility, and I should remember that maternal autoimmune hemolytic anemia can passively transfer antibodies with risk of late-onset anemia, so cord DAT and follow-up CBCs are prudent in exposed infants [^117JwsEY] [^115s339h] [^1174E6hE]. Nonimmune hemolysis spans hereditary spherocytosis and other membranopathies, G6PD and PK deficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, microangiopathic processes, and infections; I need to ensure I tailor testing to the smear and clinical context, and escalate to enzyme assays or molecular testing when indicated [^111kLtJd] [^117SDBHi] [^114yztJ1].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall in hemolysis workup: relying solely on a normal DAT to exclude hemolysis. While DAT is highly informative, some hemolytic anemias are DAT-negative, such as hereditary spherocytosis, so a negative DAT does not exclude hemolysis when the clinical and laboratory picture is compelling; in that scenario, I should proceed with smear, enzyme testing, and membrane studies rather than stopping [^111kLtJd] [^111nEBKY].

> For decreased production, I need to check for bone marrow failure syndromes and transient erythropoietic suppression. Diamond-Blackfan anemia can present in the neonatal period with macrocytosis and reticulocytopenia, and although macrocytosis may be masked by early transfusions or coexisting iron deficiency, erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity can support the diagnosis; I should confirm that steroid responsiveness is not used as a diagnostic criterion and avoid empiric steroids before diagnosis [^112Tw9kw] [^114jZJTV]. Transient erythropoietic suppression from parvovirus B19 or other infections, and nutritional deficiencies such as folate or B12, should be considered, and I should double-check maternal history for exposures and maternal anemia, as maternal iron deficiency and perinatal iron deficiency can contribute to neonatal anemia risk and management planning [^1125RLan] [^115wM5wn].

> Let me first confirm the initial diagnostic evaluation that efficiently separates these categories. A CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, and DAT are foundational; the reticulocyte count immediately distinguishes increased destruction or loss from decreased production, and the smear and DAT refine hemolysis subtypes, while MCV helps flag microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic patterns that guide next steps [^1176yBmc] [^116DbepM]. I should double-check that I also obtain a bilirubin and, when indicated, G6PD activity, especially if hyperbilirubinemia is significant or refractory to phototherapy, to avoid missing preventable causes of hemolysis [^114jDhEc] [^115sMhns].

> If the reticulocyte count is high, I should prioritize blood loss and hemolysis and then layer targeted tests. For suspected FMH, I will send maternal KBT and consider AFP if discordant; for suspected alloimmunization, I will obtain maternal antibody screen and infant DAT; for suspected hereditary spherocytosis, I will examine the smear for spherocytes and consider EMA binding or molecular testing; for suspected enzymopathies, I will order G6PD and PK activity; and for suspected hemoglobinopathy, I will obtain hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography, keeping in mind the neonatal switch in globin synthesis and the possibility of early false reassurance [^115sWDRF] [^117SDBHi] [^111nEBKY] [^114yztJ1]. But wait, what if the infant is from an endemic region or has unexplained fever with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia? I should review maternal and perinatal exposures and consider vector-borne infections such as babesiosis or congenital malaria, adding smear review and PCR when suspicion is high, given documented vertical transmission and sepsis-mimicking presentations [^115nmK1W] [^114ZX3hh] [^114eQpWz].

> If the reticulocyte count is low, I should pivot to decreased production and verify marrow function with additional studies. I will consider infection serologies including parvovirus B19, assess for nutritional deficiencies with folate and B12, and evaluate for congenital bone marrow failure syndromes; in suspected DBA, I will check eADA activity and pursue genetic testing, and in refractory or multi-lineage cytopenias, I will involve pediatric hematology and consider bone marrow evaluation, recognizing that early genetic testing can obviate invasive procedures in some cases [^1125RLan] [^112Tw9kw] [^114jZJTV] [^11137NRi]. Hold on, I should verify that I do not jump to marrow biopsy prematurely; a targeted genetic panel guided by phenotype can expedite diagnosis and spare infants unnecessary procedures when results are definitive [^116ZUyd5].

> I need to ensure I also account for special neonatal contexts that modify the differential. Anemia of prematurity is common and multifactorial, driven by developmental erythropoietic insufficiency and compounded by iatrogenic blood loss; recognizing this early helps set expectations and transfusion thresholds, and I should double-check that my transfusion decisions align with contemporary restrictive strategies in very preterm infants [^114RQZcb] [^113DJgFs] [^112vSP7r]. In monochorionic twins, I should consider twin anemia-polycythemia sequence and other complications that can produce severe discordant anemia, coordinating with maternal-fetal medicine for antenatal surveillance and intrauterine transfusion planning when indicated [^115pmFxs] [^115UEev4].

> Management must be prioritized by stability and etiology, and I should confirm immediate resuscitation steps when anemia is severe. Supportive care with oxygen and stabilization precedes definitive therapy; for blood loss anemia, volume resuscitation and RBC transfusion are indicated, and for hemolysis, phototherapy and exchange transfusion may be required for hyperbilirubinemia, with DAT-guided immunotherapy decisions in alloimmunization; for decreased production, transfusion support and etiology-specific therapy such as corticosteroids in DBA or antivirals in parvovirus are considered, ideally in consultation with pediatric hematology [^113S4aNM] [^114jDhEc] [^112Tw9kw]. I should double-check transfusion thresholds in very preterm infants, as recent consensus favors restrictive strategies with thresholds tailored to postnatal age and respiratory support status, balancing neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes [^112vSP7r] [^1121Efpz].

> Finally, I should review follow-up and monitoring, especially for late-onset anemia. In infants exposed to maternal antibodies or with a positive DAT, I will arrange serial hemoglobin checks for at least 6 weeks to detect delayed anemia, and in all neonates with significant anemia, I will ensure a plan to reassess hemolysis markers, reticulocyte response, and bilirubin trends after interventions to confirm trajectory improvement and detect complications early [^1174E6hE] [^115s339h]. Let me reconsider the initial premise one more time: anchoring the diagnosis to gestational and postnatal age–specific norms, using reticulocyte count to separate increased loss or destruction from decreased production, and layering targeted tests based on smear, DAT, and MCV yields a precise, efficient differential that prevents both under- and over-testing in neonatal anemia [^111mP78c] [^116DbepM].

Neonatal anemia has a **broad differential** spanning blood loss, hemolysis, and impaired production [^1152gK26]. The most common causes are **fetomaternal hemorrhage** [^115sWDRF], **hemolytic disease of the newborn** (Rh/ABO incompatibility) [^111kLtJd], and **anemia of prematurity** [^113DJgFs]; less frequent etiologies include congenital infections, inherited red cell disorders, and iatrogenic blood loss [^111mP78c]. Initial evaluation should include a CBC with reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, and direct antiglobulin test [^111kLtJd]; further testing (e.g. hemoglobin electrophoresis, enzyme assays, molecular testing) is guided by clinical context and lab results [^114RQZcb]. Prompt recognition and targeted testing are essential to guide management and prevent complications [^111mP78c].

## Classification of neonatal anemia

Neonatal anemia can be classified into **three main categories** based on pathophysiology:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Blood loss (hemorrhagic) | - Fetomaternal hemorrhage [^115sWDRF] <br/> - Placental abruption <br/> - Umbilical cord rupture <br/> - Internal hemorrhage (intracranial, hepatic, splenic) [^114dUjoP] <br/> - Iatrogenic blood loss (frequent phlebotomy) [^1172Dnbo] |
| Hemolytic anemia | - Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to Rh or ABO incompatibility [^115sMhns] <br/> - G6PD deficiency [^115sMhns] <br/> - Hereditary spherocytosis [^111nEBKY] <br/> - Pyruvate kinase deficiency [^114yztJ1] <br/> - Congenital infections (CMV, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, parvovirus B19) [^notfound] |
| Decreased production (hypoplastic) | - Anemia of prematurity [^113DJgFs] <br/> - Diamond-Blackfan anemia [^112Tw9kw] <br/> - Congenital infections (parvovirus B19, HIV) [^notfound] <br/> - Nutritional deficiencies (iron, folate, vitamin B12) [^114Wx4vx] |

## Common causes of neonatal anemia

### Blood loss (hemorrhagic anemia)

- **Fetomaternal hemorrhage**: Transfer of fetal blood into maternal circulation, confirmed by Kleihauer-Betke test or flow cytometry [^115sWDRF].
- **Placental abruption**: Premature separation of the placenta causing significant blood loss.
- **Umbilical cord rupture**: Traumatic rupture or avulsion of the umbilical cord.
- **Internal hemorrhage**: Intracranial, hepatic, or splenic hemorrhage, often associated with birth trauma or coagulopathies [^114dUjoP].
- **Iatrogenic blood loss**: Frequent phlebotomy in preterm infants [^1172Dnbo].

---

### Hemolytic anemia

- **Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)**: Immune-mediated hemolysis due to Rh or ABO incompatibility, confirmed by direct antiglobulin test (DAT) [^111kLtJd].
- **Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency**: X-linked enzyme deficiency causing hemolysis, particularly with oxidative stress [^116BUCJX].
- **Hereditary spherocytosis**: Autosomal dominant membrane defect causing spherocytosis and hemolysis [^111nEBKY].
- **Pyruvate kinase deficiency**: Autosomal recessive enzyme deficiency causing chronic hemolytic anemia [^114yztJ1].
- **Congenital infections**: CMV, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, parvovirus B19 causing hemolysis [^notfound].

---

### Decreased production (hypoplastic anemia)

- **Anemia of prematurity**: Multifactorial anemia due to shortened RBC lifespan, low erythropoietin production, and iatrogenic blood loss [^113DJgFs].
- **Diamond-Blackfan anemia**: Congenital pure red cell aplasia presenting in infancy [^112Tw9kw].
- **Congenital infections**: Parvovirus B19, HIV causing marrow suppression [^1125RLan].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency causing impaired erythropoiesis [^114Wx4vx].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause of neonatal anemia:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic tests** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, peripheral smear | - Initial assessment of anemia severity <br/> - Reticulocyte response <br/> - RBC morphology [^1176yBmc] |
| 2 | Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) | Identify immune-mediated hemolysis (HDN) [^111kLtJd] |
| 3 | Kleihauer-Betke test or flow cytometry | Detect fetomolecular hemorrhage [^115sWDRF] |
| 4 | G6PD assay, pyruvate kinase assay, hemoglobin electrophoresis | Identify enzymopathies and hemoglobinopathies [^115sMhns] |
| 5 | Infectious serologies (CMV, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, parvovirus B19) | Detect congenital infections [^notfound] |
| 6 | Bone marrow aspiration (rarely indicated) | Evaluate hypoplastic anemia or marrow failure syndromes [^117U4Aii] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Neonatal anemia can lead to significant morbidity, including **neurologic impairment** [^114RQZcb], growth restriction, and increased risk of infection. Management depends on the underlying cause and severity:

- **Blood loss anemia**: Immediate stabilization, volume resuscitation, and RBC transfusion as indicated [^113S4aNM].
- **Hemolytic anemia**: Phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia, exchange transfusion for severe cases, and specific treatments for underlying causes (e.g. IVIG for HDN) [^115wVvLd].
- **Decreased production anemia**: Supportive care, RBC transfusions, and treatment of underlying causes (e.g. nutritional supplementation, antiviral therapy) [^1121Efpz].

Neonatal anemia has a **broad differential**, including blood loss, hemolysis, and decreased production [^1152gK26]. A systematic diagnostic approach — CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, DAT, and targeted tests — is essential to identify the cause and guide management [^117St36s].

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^1152gK26]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Differential diagnosis and management of polycythemia [^112cEBXA]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

One percent to 5% of all newborns in the United States are polycythemic. As the venous hematocrit rises above 65%, the thickness or viscosity of whole blood also increases, potentially compromising blood flow to a variety of organs. Fortunately, relatively few infants who have neonatal polycythemia or hyperviscosity develop complications attributable to their thick blood; however, controversy and the need for continued research envelop the issue of which infants are at risk and need to be treated. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of neonatal polycythemia.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Diagnosing anemia in neonates: an evidence-based approach [^111mP78c]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

It is important for clinicians who render neonatal care to precisely and reproducibly diagnose anemia; however, confusion arises from various definitions. For the simplicity and consistency of detection, we advocate defining neonatal anemia as a hemoglobin level or hematocrit below the 5th percentile of the reference population, which is highly dependent on gestational and postnatal ages. Thus, a newborn infant delivered at 24 weeks' gestation will have anemia with a blood hemoglobin concentration much lower than a hemoglobin concentration defining anemia at term. Moreover, a hemoglobin concentration defining anemia at term birth is higher than that defining anemia in the same infant 60 days after birth. Diagnosing neonatal anemia can be evidence-based and consistent by using reference intervals derived from large neonatal databases. To do this, we advocate defining anemia as a hemoglobin level that plots below the 5th percentile lower reference interval, defining moderately severe anemia as a hemoglobin value between the 1st and 5th percentile, and defining severe anemia as a hemoglobin level that plots below the 1st percentile. The information provided in this review can easily be adopted by clinical laboratories and individual neonatal care units, thereby fostering application of these definitions for all infants whose hemoglobin levels are measured. Additional normative values included in this review describing various other erythrocyte metrics can likewise be easily adopted. Doing so will codify and standardize the diagnosis of neonatal anemia and will facilitate identifying the cause of the anemia, thus pointing the way to proper additional diagnostic testing and treatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (evaluation), ACOG 2021 guidelines recommend to evaluate pregnant patients meeting criteria for anemia (hematocrit levels < 33% in the first and third trimesters and < 32% in the second trimester) to determine the cause. Evaluate for other etiologies if iron deficiency is excluded.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^116BUCJX]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The experts panel reached 95.5% (21/22) of consensus on this recommendation (Figure 1).

Q3. What is the diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis of congenital and acquired forms of methemoglobinemia? What are the functional and molecular tests to be performed in cases of new variants where diagnosis is reached through NGS?

Although it is of importance to establish a hereditary cause for methemoglobinemia, the distinction between acquired and inherited causes is not required for treatment of the acute patient and, hence, treatment should be initiated while the cause is being investigated.
The key tests in the differential diagnosis of methemoglobinemia are the measurement of MetHb levels using blood gas measurement by co‐oximetry, the measurement of cytochrome b5 reductase enzymatic activity, and DNA analysis. CYB5R enzymatic activity, previously called methemoglobin reductase or methemoglobin diaphorase, is generally measured using ferricyanide as a substrate and oxidation of NADH at 340 nm according to the following reaction:

Elevated MetHb may also occur in patients with unstable hemoglobins and other hemolytic anemias, such as G6PD deficiency. In these patients, hemolysis is the main sign and symptom and methemoglobinemia may appear after exposure to oxidant drugs. Heinz body formation may be observed at peripheral blood examination. Isopropanol or heat stability testing is usually altered in these cases and may be useful in the differential diagnosis. When suspecting a Hb‐variant, the most efficient approach to the diagnosis is targeted sequencing of the globin genes.
With the advent of NGS technologies the causative genes of hereditary methemoglobinemia are usually included in targeted NGS panels and the identification of pathogenic variants enables either the confirmation or exclusion of inherited and acquired forms or methemoglobinemia. In case new variants are identified in CYB5R3, the enzyme activity assay described above can be used to assess their pathogenicity.

(Recommendations) Cytochrome b5 reductase activity measurement is the gold standard test to discriminate hereditary CYB5R3 deficiency from acquired methemoglobinemia. Molecular testing can be considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of hereditary methemoglobinemia.

The experts panel reached 90.9% (20/22) of consensus on this recommendation (Figure 1).

Q4. What is the clinical management of methemoglobinemia in neonatal/childhood period and the therapeutic approach?

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### The anemic and thrombocytopenic febrile neonate [^115nmK1W]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Babesiosis is a tick-borne, protozoal disease seen primarily in the northeastern and northern Midwest portions of the United States. It is primarily transmitted through the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick and may cause hemolysis.

Case Report

In the following case report, we present a 4-week-old male neonate with a temperature of 38.8°C (102.0°F) who presented to our pediatric emergency department with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. Blood smear analysis demonstrated U-shaped parasitic rings within red blood cells consistent with babesiosis, confirmed by a positive Babesia microti antibody screen. Because the patient was never exposed to a vector for babesiosis, and never lived in an endemic area, the most likely exposure was in-utero transmission of the disease through transplacental migration of the parasite prior to birth. The patient was treated with atovaquone and azithromycin and discharged from the hospital after 6 days. The patient's mother also tested positive and was treated with the same medications. The evaluation of a febrile neonate includes a broad differential diagnosis. Although babesiosis is still uncommon in many areas of the United States, a specific constellation of laboratory findings and symptoms should prompt its consideration, even in patients who have not been exposed to an endemic area or a typical vector. Vertical transmission of babesiosis has been previously reported, but the occurrence is quite rare. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Practitioners should include babesiosis in their differential diagnosis where appropriate and be aware that it can be transmitted not only via tick bite, but also from mother to neonate during pregnancy.

### Treatment and prevention of neonatal anemia [^113S4aNM]. NeoReviews (2008). Low credibility.

Because red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy remains the primary treatment of anemia encountered in early life, the basis for RBC transfusion in the treatment of symptomatic anemia is discussed in this review along with several important aspects of neonatal blood banking practices. Nontransfusion approaches to the prevention and treatment of neonatal anemia also are described. Finally, this review covers the controversy surrounding whether neonatal RBC transfusion therapy should be restrictive or liberal. The evaluation and treatment of uncommon and rare acquired and genetic causes of anemia in newborn infants are beyond the scope of this review.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: an unexpected cause [^117E5NEu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common cause for newborn hospital admission. Although the cause of hyperbilirubinemia is usually benign and self-limited, there is always a large differential diagnosis. Atypical presenting signs and symptoms, such as significant anemia or bleeding, should encourage further evaluation for underlying disorders, such as inherited coagulation defects. This article describes the case of a 5-day-old infant who presented to the emergency department with hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and ecchymoses from birth trauma. His hospital course is described, along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of hemophilia A.

### A "Gold standard" test for diagnosing and quantifying hemolysis in neonates and infants [^1125sXRL]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Identifying "gold standard" diagnostic tests can promote evidence-based neonatology practice. Hemolysis is a pathological shortening of the erythrocyte lifespan, differing from erythrocyte senescence in responsible mechanisms and clinical implications. Diagnosing hemolysis goes beyond a binary (yes vs. no) determination. It is characterized according to magnitude, and as acute vs. chronic, and genetically based vs. not. For neonates with significant hyperbilirubinemia or anemia, detecting hemolysis and quantifying its magnitude provides diagnostic clarity. The 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Clinical Practice Guideline on management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn states that hemolysis is a risk factor for developing significant hyperbilirubinemia and neurotoxicity. The guideline recommends identifying hemolysis from any cause, but specific guidance is not provided. A spectrum of laboratory tests has been endorsed as diagnostic methods for hemolysis. Herein we examine these laboratory tests and recommend one as the "gold standard" for diagnosing and quantifying hemolysis in neonates and infants.

### Pathophysiology of anemia during the neonatal period, including anemia of prematurity [^1172Dnbo]. NeoReviews (2008). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the current thinking about the causes of anemia universally experienced by preterm infants in the early postnatal weeks. In addition to describing developmentally determined physiologic processes contributing to anemia of prematurity, this review discusses clinically important nonphysiologic contributors to anemia experienced by preterm infants during the neonatal period. Chief among these and an important contributor to the need for red blood cell transfusions is the heavy laboratory phlebotomy loss sustained shortly after birth, when neonatal cardiorespiratory illness is most severe. Understanding and recognizing the physiologic and nonphysiologic processes contributing to anemia encountered in early postnatal life is important in knowing which treatment and prevention modalities are likely to be most effective in different clinical situations. The evaluation of rare and uncommon acquired and genetic causes of anemia in newborns are not covered in this review.

### Anemia in the pediatric patient [^114RQZcb]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately a quarter of the world's population suffers from anemia, including almost half of preschool-age children. Globally, iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia. Other important causes of anemia in children are hemoglobinopathies, infection, and other chronic diseases. Anemia is associated with increased morbidity, including neurologic complications, increased risk of low birth weight, infection, and heart failure, as well as increased mortality. When approaching a child with anemia, detailed historical information, particularly diet, environmental exposures, and family history, often yield important clues to the diagnosis. Dysmorphic features on physical examination may indicate syndromic causes of anemia. Diagnostic testing involves a stepwise approach utilizing various laboratory techniques. The increasing availability of genetic testing is providing new mechanistic insights into inherited anemias and allowing diagnosis in many previously undiagnosed cases. Population-based approaches are being taken to address nutritional anemias. Novel pharmacologic agents and advances in gene therapy-based therapeutics have the potential to ameliorate anemia-associated disease and provide treatment strategies even in the most difficult and complex cases.

### Evaluation of bleeding disorders in the newborn [^111eU7Zj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal bleeding disorders may present a diagnostic challenge to the pediatric clinician. Isolated thrombocytopenia rarely presents as a hemorrhagic emergency. Appropriate laboratory testing with incorporation of time of presentation and disease state is crucial to formatting an appropriate differential diagnosis. Deficiencies of certain coagulation proteins coupled with multiple acquired risk factors and/or thrombocytopenia can result in a hemorrhagic emergency in the neonatal period.

### Differential diagnosis of hydrops fetalis: an imaging guide [^115Hcsub]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrops fetalis is a critical diagnosis given the poor prognosis and vast differential of potential causes. After a detailed anatomic survey, the first step in differentiating among the various causes is measurement of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity to evaluate for anemia. Anemia is the key decision point in the diagnostic algorithm that categorizes hydrops. This approach is more practical than an immune versus nonimmune classification because it capitalizes on clues available at the time of sonographic diagnosis and expedites care toward possible therapies, such as intrauterine transfusion. The causes of hydrops that share the underlying physiology of fetal anemia include alloimmunization, which accounts for 10% of cases, congenital infections, hemoglobinopathies, and fetomaternal hemorrhage. After ruling out anemia, the differential diagnosis expands to cardiovascular disorders (20%-28% of cases), genetic abnormalities (10%-30% of cases), fetal masses (eg, congenital lung masses, sacrococcygeal teratomas), and monochorionic twin complications. Even after a thorough evaluation, 15% of hydrops cases remain of unknown cause. There are treatments available for select disorders that have the potential to reverse the signs of hydrops. Several imaging pitfalls should be avoided when establishing the diagnosis of hydrops, such as mistaking abdominal wall muscles, physiologic pericardial fluid, or thick subcutaneous tissue as pathologic fluid accumulation. A practical and comprehensive approach to the diagnostic evaluation for hydrops fetalis avoids delays in diagnosis and expedites potential life-saving treatment of this disorder. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^114ZX3hh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this case suggests that neonatal babesiosis should be a consideration in the broad differential diagnosis for neonatal fever in endemic regions. Clinicians should carefully review maternal antepartum history including exposures and routine laboratory results, and consider obtaining a peripheral blood smear in at-risk infants with late-onset sepsis of unclear source, especially in the setting of neonatal anemia or thrombocytopenia.

### Neonatal cardiorespiratory failure caused by splenic hemorrhages: a case report on a fatal and a rescued case [^114dUjoP]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiorespiratory failure in newborns can be regarded as a final common pathway, with a broad spectrum of potential underlying diagnoses. The primary considerations encompass sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, abdominal problems (e.g. obstruction, or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature cases), blood loss (e.g. due to birth trauma or coagulation disorders, with cerebral bleeding being the most common), a (congenital) cardiac disorder or an inborn error of metabolism. The diagnostic assessment involves the initial elimination and preemptive treatment of these most prevalent and/or life-threatening causes. However, when the cause of cardiorespiratory failure remains unknown after ruling out the most common causes, this article aims to demonstrate the importance of timely considering splenic hemorrhage in the differential diagnosis.

In children, a splenic hemorrhage most often results from blunt trauma. As the spleen is a highly vascular organ, there is a high risk of cardiorespiratory failure due to hypovolemic shock when a splenic hemorrhage occurs. The clinical presentation of neonatal splenic hemorrhage is often nonspecific and may include pallor, anemia, abdominal distention, and eventually cardiorespiratory failure.

This report describes two cases of splenic hemorrhage in neonates as primary cause of cardiorespiratory failure, including a description of symptoms, diagnostics tests, management and outcome.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Neonatal thrombocytopenia as a presenting finding in de novo pyruvate kinase deficiency [^114yztJ1]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common laboratory abnormality encountered in critically ill neonates. The broad differential for thrombocytopenia, and its association with potentially severe neonatal pathology, often presents a diagnostic dilemma prompting extensive evaluation. Hemolysis due to red cell enzymopathies is a rare cause of neonatal thrombocytopenia that is typically brief and self-limiting. Here, we present a case of thrombocytopenia, refractory to transfusion, associated with anemia and hyperbilirubinemia in a neonate with pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) arising from compound heterozygous PKLR mutations. The nature of the thrombocytopenia in this patient created considerable diagnostic uncertainty, which was ultimately resolved by whole-exome sequencing. This case emphasizes that inherited red cell defects, such as PKD, are important to consider in cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^112Tw9kw]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Table I
Classification of pure red cell aplasia *.

Table II
Differential diagnosis of DBA versus TEC. *

Diamond Blackfan anaemia was first described as a disorder of impaired red cell production in children. The presentation in adults, the risk of other cytopenias, the predisposition to cancer and the high incidence of birth defects are now being quantified. The diagnostic criteria for DBA, presented in 1976, have remained the accepted standard. These include anaemia, presenting prior to the first birthday, with near normal, but variable, neutrophil and/or platelet counts, reticulocytopenia, macrocytosis and normal marrow cellularity with a paucity of red cell precursors. Newborns with DBA rarely present with hydrops fetalis. Certainly these diagnostic criteria define "classical" DBA. It is apparent from the study of multiplex families that affected individuals may present in "non-classical" ways. For example, individuals may present at an age greater than one year, only with congenital anomalies, without anaemia or with a mild hematological phenotype (macrocytosis only). These cases of "non-classical" DBA need to be more carefully identified, particularly when reproductive choices and transplant donor decisions are being made. Furthermore, as the risk of malignancy and other complications of DBA are better defined, the necessity of making a diagnosis in "asymptomatic" individuals will become more important.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^116RgeUG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Neonatal outcomes after treatment of fetal anemia: With the use of intrauterine transfusions (IUTs), overall perinatal mortality in severe fetal anemia has decreased to less than 10%. Postnatal management focuses on treatment of hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy and exchange transfusions, and other short-term complications include neonatal anemia, thrombocytopenia, cholestasis, and respiratory disease. Neonates who have undergone multiple intrauterine transfusions are generally born with an absence of reticulocytosis and may require top-offs of transfusions within the first few weeks after birth.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^113edu4K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^111ouwZ3]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluation of suspected neonatal sepsis rarely considers diagnostic workup for vector-borne illnesses, as these are generally infrequent etiologies in the febrile neonate. Babesiosis — a zoonosis caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Babesia and spread to humans by the Ixodes scapularis tick — can either be clinically silent, or symptomatic with fever, constitutional symptoms, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia. We report here a rare case of neonatal babesiosis that was incidentally identified during routine workup for neonatal sepsis.

Case Presentation

A full-term male neonate with fever was admitted to the hospital for sepsis evaluation. On routine complete blood count with manual differential blood smear, parasites were incidentally detected, later identified as Babesia microti. On review of maternal history, there was antenatal history of unexplained thrombocytopenia and anemia, and post-hoc review of peripartum maternal blood smear showed rare intra-erythrocytic parasites, which were confirmed as B. microti by PCR testing of maternal blood. Ultimately, the infant was successfully treated with azithromycin and atovaquone, received a red blood cell transfusion for symptomatic anemia, and remained well at his outpatient follow-up visit.

Conclusion

This unusual case highlights the importance of including neonatal babesiosis in the differential diagnosis for neonatal sepsis in endemic regions, including careful review of maternal antenatal exposure history and labs, and consideration of peripheral blood smear in suggestive cases.

### Severe anemia at birth-incidence and implications [^113dKkRT]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify neonates with severe anemia at birth, defined by a hemoglobin or hematocrit value within the first 6 hours after birth that plotted below the 1st percentile according to gestational age. For each patient, we retrospectively determined whether caregivers recognized the anemia within the first 24 hours after birth and the probable cause and outcome of anemia.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort analysis of Intermountain Healthcare population-based data from neonates born between January 2011 and December 2020 who had a hemoglobin or hematocrit value measured within the first 6 hours after birth below the 1st percentile lower reference interval (hematocrit ∼35% in near-term/term neonates).

Result

Among 299927 live births, we identified 344 neonates with severe anemia at birth. In 191 of these neonates (55.5%), the anemia was recognized by caregivers during the first 24 hours. Anemia was more likely to be recorded as a problem (85%) if the hemoglobin was ≥ 2 g/dL below the 1st percentile (P < .001). The lowest hemoglobin values occurred in those in whom hemorrhage was the probable cause (P < .013 vs hemolysis and P < .001 vs hypoproduction, mixed cause, or indeterminant.) Treatment was provided to 39.5%. A retrospective review suggested that mixed mechanisms, particularly hemorrhagic plus hemolytic, occurred more commonly than was recognized at the time of occurrence.

Conclusions

Severe anemia at birth often went unrecognized on the first day of life. Algorithm-directed retrospective reviews commonly identified causes that were not listed in the medical record. We postulate that earlier recognition and more accurate diagnoses would be facilitated by an electronic medical record-associated hemoglobin/hematocrit gestational age nomogram.

### Anemia of prematurity: how low is too low? [^113DJgFs]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia of prematurity (AOP) is a common condition with a well-described chronology, nadir hemoglobin levels, and timeline of recovery. However, the underlying pathophysiology and impact of prolonged exposure of the developing infant to low levels of hemoglobin remains unclear. Phlebotomy losses exacerbate the gradual decline of hemoglobin levels which is insidious in presentation, often without any clinical signs. Progressive anemia in preterm infants is associated with poor weight gain, inability to take oral feeds, tachycardia and exacerbation of apneic, and bradycardic events. There remains a lack of consensus on treatment thresholds for RBC transfusion which vary considerably. This review elaborates on the current state of the problem, its implication for the premature infant including association with subphysiologic cerebral tissue oxygenation, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. It outlines the impact of prophylaxis and treatment of anemia of prematurity and offers suggestions on improving monitoring and management of the condition.

### Anemia in children [^114pjQww]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### Microangiopathic disorders in pregnancy [^113wf8wk]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Microangiopathic disorders present with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan damage. In pregnancy, these disorders present a challenge both diagnostically and therapeutically, with widely overlapping clinical scenarios and disparate treatments. Although rare, a clear understanding of these diseases is important because devastating maternal and fetal outcomes may ensue if there is misdiagnosis and improper treatment. Microangiopathic disorders presenting in pregnancy are thus best assessed and treated by both obstetric and hematology teams. As a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying each of the disease processes is gained, new diagnostic testing and therapies will be available, which will lead to improved outcomes.

### Hemoglobinopathies in the neonate [^117SDBHi]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies in neonates constitute a group of disorders influenced by genetic mutations in the human globin genes. They are often broadly categorized into quantitative defects or qualitative defects, though they are not mutually exclusive. In quantitative defects, the mutation causes insufficient production of a normal globin chain, which can range from no production to mild deficiency. These are typically referred to as thalassemias. In qualitative defects, the structure of the hemoglobin is altered. The most common structural hemoglobinopathy is sickle cell disease. During fetal development, distinct globin chains are synthesized, which undergo a progressive switch to adult globin chains perinatally. This affects the timing of the clinical presentation of these disorders and thus, our ability to diagnose them. In this review, we focus on the epidemiology, genetic causes, clinical presentation, and general overview and management of common hemoglobin disorders that may be encountered in the neonatal period.

Background

Fever in the neonate is a medical emergency due to the risk of neonatal sepsis and its associated morbidity and mortality. Here we describe a febrile neonate with congenital babesiosis, suspected to occur via vertical transmission. Although rare cases of vertically transmitted babesiosis have been reported, it continues to be an underappreciated pathogen in the neonatal setting. Babesiosis should be on the differential diagnosis for general pediatricians caring for febrile neonates in endemic regions even without known tick bites, particularly when the mother or infant has unexplained anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.

### Pediatric red cell disorders and pure red cell aplasia [^1125RLan]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia in children may arise from a wide variety of pathogenetic mechanisms that include congenital and acquired disorders. Often the diagnostic considerations include disorders that are not seen commonly in adults and lifelong disorders that arise in children and persist throughout life. Consideration of diverse causes of anemia such as red cell membrane disorders, red cell enzymopathies, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, congenital sideroblastic anemias, and hereditary pure red cell aplasia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia), as well as infectious causes such as parvovirus B19 infection, often is required when diagnosing anemia in an infant or young child. Knowledge of these entities that are important causes of anemia in the pediatric population, including clinical manifestations and laboratory workup, will aid in recognition of the specific disease entities and effective workup of pediatric red cell disorders.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^111RuTWr]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is a rare, genetically and clinically heterogeneous, inherited red cell aplasia. Classical DBA affects about seven per million live births and presents during the first year of life. However, as mutated genes have been discovered in DBA, non-classical cases with less distinct phenotypes are being described in adults as well as children. In caring for these patients it is often difficult to have a clear understanding of the treatment options and their outcomes because of the lack of complete information on the natural history of the disease. The purpose of this document is to review the criteria for diagnosis, evaluate the available treatment options, including corticosteroid and transfusion therapies and stem cell transplantation, and propose a plan for optimizing patient care. Congenital anomalies, mode of inheritance, cancer predisposition, and pregnancy in DBA are also reviewed. Evidence-based conclusions will be made when possible; however, as in many rare diseases, the data are often anecdotal and the recommendations are based upon the best judgment of experienced clinicians. The recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management described in this report are the result of deliberations and discussions at an international consensus conference.

### A pediatrician's practical guide to diagnosing and treating hereditary spherocytosis in neonates [^111nEBKY]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Newborn infants who have hereditary spherocytosis (HS) can develop anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction is less likely in these neonates if the diagnosis of HS is recognized and appropriate treatment provided. Among neonates listed in the United States Kernicterus Registry, HS was the third most common underlying hemolytic condition after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and ABO hemolytic disease. HS is the leading cause of direct antiglobulin test (direct Coombs) negative hemolytic anemia requiring erythrocyte transfusion in the first months of life. We anticipate that as physicians become more familiar with diagnosing HS in the newborn period, fewer neonates with HS will develop hazardous hyperbilirubinemia or present to emergency departments with unanticipated symptomatic anemia. We predict that early suspicion, prompt diagnosis and treatment, and anticipatory guidance will prevent adverse outcomes in neonates with HS. The purpose of this article was to review the neonatal presentation of HS and to provide practical and up-to-date means of diagnosing and treating HS in neonates.

### Establishing the cause of anemia in a premature newborn infant [^115sWDRF]. Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The three major causes of anemia in neonates are blood loss, decreased red blood cell production, and increased degradation of erythrocytes. Establishing the cause of anemia in a neonate born prematurely can be challenging. Clinically, fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) can be difficult to diagnose-the condition often presents only after the manifestation of severe fetal anemia. FMH can be confirmed by determining the fetal hemoglobin F fraction in the mother, which is traditionally performed using the Kleihauer-Betke test (KBT). Herein, we present a case study of a newborn baby boy of Dutch ethnicity with massive FMH and negative KBT result. The KBT result appeared to be false-negative due to AO antagonism. However, the results of an additional marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test confirmed the diagnosis of massive FMH. Therefore, measuring AFP in maternal blood can be helpful in confirming FMH in unexplained anemia of the neonate.

### Congenital cytopenias and bone marrow failure syndromes [^117U4Aii]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital bone marrow failure syndromes (CBMFS) are extremely uncommon diseases that can present in the neonate. The objective of this article is to review the presentation, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of CBMFS in relation to neonatology. CBMFS should be considered when a single or multiple blood cell lineages are low secondary to failure of production. Diagnosis in the neonatal period requires a high index of suspicion. In this particular age group, CBMFS should be considered when the neonate has a family history of CBMFS, is small for gestational age, or has other physical abnormalities. History and physical examination can lead to the diagnosis. CBMFS are often associated with a predisposition to cancer later in life.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^114jZJTV]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^113ByMeE]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.10 Iron deficiency in high‐risk populations with chronic inflammatory conditions

Chronic conditions cannot be viewed in isolation and there will be circumstances where individuals may have further increased susceptibility to iron deficiency. To optimize outcomes for these patients, risks need to be pre‐empted wherever possible. Three important populations to consider among your patients are: women (particularly those who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, and those who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]); the elderly; and those undergoing surgery.

Women of reproductive age are one of the most at‐risk population groups for iron deficiency anemia. Between 4 and 52% of women of reproductive age are reported to suffer from HMB, with a wide range reflecting disparities between study populations and how HMB is defined 88 Notably, a recent European study demonstrated that 63% of the participating HMB patients were suffering from iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. 89 Iron deficiency in combination with HMB can have debilitating consequences on the QoL and wellbeing of the sufferer. 90, 91, 92, 93 Thus, many of these women enter pregnancy with low iron stores and are often already anemic. Approximately 42% of pregnant women worldwide have anemia, with iron deficiency anemia being the primary cause, and this may have a serious detrimental effect on the outcome for both mother and child. 2, 94, 95, 96 In pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, possibly due to not being able to withstand the adverse effect of excessive blood loss at delivery and the increased risk of infection. 96 Iron deficiency anemia also affects the child and has been linked with increased risk of preterm labor and subsequent low birthweight, and perinatal complications. 97 Moreover, there is an association between maternal iron status in pregnancy with that of the infant; with infants born to anemic mothers being more likely to be anemic themselves. 98 Iron deficiency also carries negative long‐term impact on the mother–child relationship and the child's cognitive development, of which the latter has shown to persist for up to 10 years, even after iron repletion. 95, 99, 100

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Anemia [^112VViZf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia is an enormous problem worldwide that is worse in the developing countries but by no means lacking in developed countries. Women and children are disproportionately affected. Nutritional anemias, mainly caused by a lack of iron and folate, are largely correctable by dietary improvement, but this socioeconomic change may not be readily achieved. The inherited disorders, the hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, in their heterozygous forms are beneficial to the affected populations. Prevention of the homozygous forms and the serious diseases that result can only be addressed by education. These conditions are seen in all types of medical practice ranging from neonatology to geriatrics and public health and are an ongoing concern to all physicians.

### Clinical practice guideline for red blood cell transfusion thresholds in very preterm neonates [^112vSP7r]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common medical intervention to treat anemia in very preterm neonates; however, best transfusion practices, such as thresholds, remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop recommendations for clinicians on the use of RBC transfusions in very preterm neonates.

Evidence Review

An international steering committee reviewed evidence from a systematic review of 6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared high vs low hemoglobin-based or hematocrit-based transfusion thresholds. The steering committee reached consensus on certainty-of-evidence ratings and worked with a panel from stakeholder organizations on reviewing the evidence. With input from parent representatives and the stakeholder panel, the steering committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop recommendations.

Findings

A systematic review of 6 RCTs encompassing 3483 participants (1759 females [51.3%]; mean [SD] age range, 25.9–29.8 [1.5–3.0] weeks) was used as the basis of the recommendations. The ranges for higher hemoglobin concentration (liberal) vs lower hemoglobin concentration (restrictive) threshold study arms were similar across the trials. However, specific thresholds differed based on the severity of illness, which was defined using variable criteria in the trials. There was moderate certainty of evidence that low transfusion thresholds likely had little to no difference in important short-term and long-term outcomes. The recommended hemoglobin thresholds varied on the basis of postnatal week and respiratory support needs. At postnatal weeks 1, 2, and 3 or more, for neonates on respiratory support, the recommended thresholds were 11, 10, and 9 g/dL, respectively; for neonates on no or minimal respiratory support, the recommended thresholds were 10, 8.5, and 7 g/dL, respectively (to convert hemoglobin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0).

Conclusions and Relevance

This consensus statement recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy, with moderate certainty of evidence, for preterm neonates with less than 30 weeks' gestation.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^1146TLAT]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Arrhythmias during pregnancy — diagnostic evaluation follows nonpregnant pathways with targeted exceptions, as similar recommendations for diagnostic evaluation of palpitations apply as in nonpregnant patients and the diagnostic evaluation rules out underlying structural or electrical heart disease with ECG documentation during palpitations for symptom–rhythm correlation; the choice of monitoring depends on palpitation frequency and longer recording duration provides higher diagnostic yield, while initial evaluation should aim at ruling out potentially life-threatening arrhythmic etiology, ECG documentation of symptoms during palpitations, and evaluation of underlying structural or electrical heart disease, with targeted blood testing that can exclude anemia due to bleeding, thyroid dysfunction, infection, electrolyte abnormalities, and other conditions; resting 12-lead ECG is part of the reviewed approach, ECG documentation during ongoing palpitations will allow clear diagnosis, and documented arrhythmia in pregnant patients with congenital or acquired heart disease is an important risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

With our increasing understanding of inherited marrow failure and myeloid malignancy predisposition syndromes, it has become clear that there is a wide phenotypic spectrum and that these diseases must be considered in the differential diagnosis of both children and adults with unexplained defects in hematopoiesis. Moreover, these conditions are not as rare as previously believed and may present as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or malignancy over a range of ages. Establishing the correct diagnosis is essential because it has implications for treatment, medical management, cancer screening, and family planning. Our goal is to highlight insights into the pathophysiology of these diseases, review cryptic presentations of these syndromes, and provide useful references for the practicing hematologist.

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^115zvhfK]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count was also obtained, with manual differential via peripheral smear review incidentally identifying intraerythrocytic ring forms (Fig. 1). Reflex testing for malarial antigens was negative, and parasite load was formally quantified at 5% parasitemia. A presumptive diagnosis of babesiosis was rendered, and Babesia PCR confirmed that the neonate was positive for B. microti.

Fig. 1
Peripheral blood smear for neonate on initial presentation, with intraerythrocytic forms highlighted (arrows)

Post-hoc evaluation of a peripartum peripheral blood smear from the patient's mother revealed that she had previously undetected, very low (< 1% estimated) parasitemia (Fig. 2) at the time of her concurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia. Subsequent PCR testing, completed at the time of patient's admission, showed that the patient's mother was also PCR-positive for Babesia microti.

Fig. 2
Peripheral blood smear for mother near time of delivery, with intraerythrocytic forms highlighted (arrow)

The infant was diagnosed with neonatal babesiosis. We suspect that the patient was infected with B. microti through vertical transmission given that his mother had antenatal anemia and thrombocytopenia, coupled with perinatal maternal B. microti parasitemia, and because the neonate had low risk epidemiologic profile for post-natal acquisition.

The patient was started on intravenous azithromycin and oral atovaquone. He responded well to antimicrobial therapy, rapidly defervescing and clearing parasitemia by day 6 of therapy. He was treated for a total of 10 days, until 2 consecutive blood smears over 48 h were parasite-free. He had symptomatic anemia during hospitalization, requiring one red blood cell transfusion, with both anemia and thrombocytopenia promptly and stably normalizing over time (Fig. 3).

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

Discussion

Diagnosis of CDA-1 is based on clinical, bone marrow morphological and molecular features. Bone marrow biopsy in neonates is complex and nonspecific and was not performed in our case. Genetic testing by WES (non-phenotype-targeted analysis) confirmed the diagnosis, highlighting the role of such assays in situations where conventional investigations are not feasible or are limited.

In this case, placental analysis reveals marked placentomegaly with placental megaloblastic and dysplastic erythroblastosis. In the absence of viral inclusion of Parvovirus B19, the observation of megaloblastic erythroblastosis may indicate disorders of folate or vitamin B12 metabolism. However, when the megaloblastic component is particularly prominent, the differential diagnosis should be broadened to include rare congenital disorder such as CDA-1. Therefore, in cases of unexplained placental erythroblastosis with prominent megaloblastic features, associated with suggestive clinical features, clinicians and pathologists should maintain a high index of suspicion for CDA-1.

The treatment of CDA-1 is mainly supportive and focuses on the standard of care for anemia and iron overload. Some patients respond to interferon-alpha. In our case, despite a very severe neonatal phenotype, early diagnosis led to a favorable outcome.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^114vL6Nn]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### The impact of response to iron therapy on maternal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with anemia [^115pxABH]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia during pregnancy is one of the most common diagnoses among gravidae, given that it is estimated to affect 40% of women worldwide. The prevalence of anemia among pregnant women in the United States has been estimated to be approximately 10% to 12%. – The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has defined pathologic anemia in pregnancy as a hemoglobin level of < 11.0 g/dL in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy and a hemoglobin level of < 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester of pregnancy. The ACOG recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia and treating women with suspected iron deficiency with iron supplementation. Of note, 1 study estimated that only 50% of pregnant women with anemia respond to iron therapy.

Studies have shown that beyond physiological dilutional anemia of pregnancy, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE), cesarean delivery, and perinatal death.– In addition, women with anemia have an increased risk of perinatal blood transfusions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and postpartum depression. A 2011 Cochrane review evaluated different treatments of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal morbidity and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to suggest an efficacious reduction in the incidence of perinatal complications. They concluded that further studies are needed to evaluate whether treatment of iron deficiency anemia can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Given these knowledge gaps, we undertook a large population-based cohort study to evaluate whether treatment of anemia during pregnancy with oral iron therapy was associated with a change in the occurrence of associated perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB) and PE. We further evaluated whether this effect was modified by treatment and response, as measured by correction of the maternal hemoglobin at delivery.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^116ZUyd5]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

Diagnosis of CDA‐I is often predicated on a high index of suspicion. With rare disorders, awareness of the condition is necessary before appropriate investigations are instigated. Traditional pathways for the investigation of rare inherited anaemias follow the usual sequence of history and examination, standard haematological and biochemical assays, possibly radiological imaging, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine and genetic analysis. However, this approach is quickly changing with the advent of clinical‐grade next‐generation sequencing (Fig 1). Nevertheless, all investigations will be guided by a thorough initial consultation with the patient.

Figure 1
Comparison between the conventional pathway and an alternative NGS‐based pathway for the investigation of inherited anaemias. In the conventional pathway, patients are investigated sequentially where a differential diagnosis is devised based on history, examination and standard blood investigations. Specialised tests are then requested according to the suspected diagnosis and a bone marrow investigation frequently performed. Genetic testing is then reserved as a confirmatory test. In the alternative pathway, NGS is employed early, obviating the need for bone marrow biopsies in some patients where clear molecular diagnoses can be made by NGS. Where variants of uncertain significance are identified functional tests are required to confirm or refute the variant's pathogenicity. This alternative pathway can cut the time to diagnosis, remove the need for some bone marrow biopsies, provide accurate diagnosis of cases and allow genetic counselling. eADA, erythrocyte adenine deaminase; EMA, eosin‐5‐maleimide; Hb HPLC, haemoglobin high performance liquid chromatography; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NGS, next‐generation sequencing.

### Case report: severeMalaria mimicking sepsis in a neonate [^114eQpWz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Severe congenital malaria associated with Plasmodium vivax is uncommon. In Indonesia, most congenital malaria cases are due to Plasmodium falciparum infections. Most cases of congenital or neonatal malaria in endemic areas are diagnosed from peripheral smear as part of routine sepsis workup. Differentiating congenital and acquired neonatal malaria is very difficult. The case presented in this study describes severe P. vivax malaria with cholestatic jaundice and sepsis-like signs and symptoms in neonates. The mother was asymptomatic and the neonate was successfully treated with intravenous artesunate. Severe P. vivax malaria with cholestatic jaundice in neonates is an uncommon condition that should be included in the differential diagnosis of infants displaying hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, cholestatic jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly in malaria-endemic zones. Early diagnosis can prevent the use of unnecessary antibiotics and mortality of neonates.

### Red blood cell transfusion thresholds for anemia of prematurity [^1121Efpz]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia of prematurity affects the majority of preterm infants, particularly extremely low birthweight infants. Anemia of prematurity arises from both innate and iatrogenic causes and results in more than 80% of extremely preterm infants receiving red blood cell transfusions during the first month after birth. Multiple randomized controlled trials were conducted to evaluate the effect of using lower versus higher transfusion thresholds based on hemoglobin levels. These trials showed no difference in the primary outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years of age between lower and higher thresholds. However, some uncertainties about transfusion thresholds remain. This review elaborates the following: 1) the etiology, prevention, and treatment of anemia of prematurity with a focus on red blood cell transfusions, 2) the history of randomized controlled trials on the treatment of anemia of prematurity, and 3) limitations of the evidence and remaining questions about thresholds for red blood cell transfusions in preterm infants.

Fetal anemia — diagnostic confirmation and invasive testing indicate that the definitive diagnosis of fetal anemia is generally made by fetal blood sampling, and fetal anemia can be directly diagnosed by fetal blood sampling in fetuses with hydrops or after surpassing the critical threshold for MCA Doppler values; these procedures carry potential risk to the fetus and mother (including infection, preterm premature rupture of membranes, abruption, premature labor, fetal or maternal bleeding, worsening alloimmunization, and fetal death), and the risk of fetal loss because of fetal blood sampling is reported to be 1–2%, which is gestational age dependent; the use of delta optical density 450 is primarily of historic interest, but in rare cases when MCA Doppler studies cannot be performed, measuring delta optical density 450 in amniotic fluid as a screening test may be reasonable, although accuracy is limited in some circumstances (such as with anti-Kell alloimmunization), and an algorithm for using delta optical density 450 is available in the medical literature.

### Role of complete blood count in the diagnosis of culture-proven neonatal sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112xDkX7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 100000 babies are admitted to neonatal units in the UK each year, primarily due to preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks) and suspected infections. Neonatal sepsis, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, accounted for 4640 cases in the UK and 6.31 million cases globally in 2019, as defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes for bacterial infections.

Accurate and timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is critical to improving outcomes. Current UK guidelines, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2021, recommend blood cultures as the gold standard. However, blood cultures are often negative in neonatal sepsis, with sensitivities as low as 40%, and results can take up to 72 hours, delaying definitive treatment decisions. Baseline C reactive protein (CRP) measurements are recommended to monitor treatment efficacy, but their delayed sensitivity limits their role in early diagnosis.

Despite its widespread use outside neonatal care, complete blood count (CBC) is not included in the NICE guidelines for diagnosing sepsis due to insufficient evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of the white cell count (WCC). In contrast, CBC is a well-established diagnostic tool in adults with suspected sepsis. Studies in adults have demonstrated significant differences in neutrophil counts between infected and non-infected patients at various time points after diagnosis (p < 0.001 at 2 days, p = 0.001 at 4 days and p = 0.013 at 7 days).

CBC is a rapid, inexpensive test that requires minimal blood volume (as little as 20 µL) and is routinely measured in neonates to monitor haemoglobin levels and detect anaemia. Recent innovations in automated haematology analysers enable the measurement of functional parameters such as immature-to-total neutrophil ratio (ITR) and mean neutrophil volume (MNV), providing a fresh perspective on the diagnostic utility of CBC. ITR is a measure of neutrophil regeneration — a higher ITR indicates an increase in immature neutrophil production in response to infection. Immature neutrophils are larger than mature neutrophils, so an increase in MNV also occurs.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CBC parameters, particularly functional markers, for neonatal sepsis. By leveraging recent advances in CBC technology and addressing limitations of prior diagnostic approaches, our study seeks to reframe CBC as a potential adjunctive tool for improving early detection and management of neonatal sepsis.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^116JzRFx]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic U.S. children ages 6 to 24 months provides: No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence). No studies assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify higher-risk children, and although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step; the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening in young children, no recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available, and the USPSTF notes a separate recommendation for pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy.

### Second international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^116sf6hj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, more specifically with respect to evaluation for iron deficiency and anemia, HHT-WG 2020 guidelines recommend to consider evaluating for additional causes of anemia in the setting of an inadequate response to iron replacement.

This high prevalence among children and pregnant women is further complicated by the occurrence of two specific forms of anemia that have been observed exclusively in these groups: "physiological anemia" and "pathological anemia". In pregnant women, "physiological anemia" is caused by a hemodilution process, leading to Hb values below the threshold defined by the WHO, although this condition is considered normal. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the main form of Hb during fetal development and is gradually replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA) after birth. By around 6 months of age, HbF levels typically decrease to less than 1% in normal populations, with most Hb being HbA (approximately 96%) and HbA2 making up 2.5%–3.5%. Therefore, hemolysis associated with elevated HbF levels is not characteristic of healthy children beyond infancy. The original claim about hemolysis due to elevated HbF in children under 5 has been adjusted to align with these facts. This normal process results in Hb values falling below the threshold defined by the WHO, classifying it as anemia. This postnatal adjustment, described by Joseph Barcroft in 1932 as "Everest in utero", is a normal physiological response rather than a sign of disease. During this period, neonates possess high iron stores, almost double (75 mg/kg) that of adults, which adequately support erythropoiesis in early life. Thus, dietary iron primarily serves to replace small daily iron losses and support growth needs. In most cases, this modest requirement is sufficiently met through breastfeeding.

In contrast, pathological anemia refers to reductions in Hb concentration due to underlying pathological processes and typically requires clinical evaluation and treatment. The causes of pathological anemia are diverse, ranging from conditions that induce blood loss, shorten red blood cell lifespan, or hinder Hb synthesis and red blood cell production. These include chronic inflammation, which disrupts iron metabolism through elevated hepcidin levels and impairs iron absorption — rendering oral iron supplementation less effective. Other etiologies include chronic kidney disease (which reduces erythropoietin production), gastrointestinal disorders (that impair nutrient absorption), malaria (which accelerates hemolysis), hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, red blood cell membrane disorders, red blood cell channelopathies, red blood cell enzyme deficiencies, and infections with neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm. These diverse causes reflect the multifactorial nature of pathological anemia, which varies according to age, physiological status, and regional disease burden.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^113Qcsgc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Early gestation severe anemia — risk, limits, and scheduling — Severely anemic fetuses at 18 — 24 weeks of gestation are at high risk of complications from intrauterine transfusion, and it has therefore been suggested that the posttransfusion hematocrit at these early gestations should not exceed 25% or a 4-fold increase from the pretransfusion value; if needed, a second intrauterine transfusion can be performed within 48 hours and a third procedure scheduled in 7 — 10 days, and in fetuses at less than 22 weeks' gestation, an intraperitoneal transfusion may be a safer approach.
