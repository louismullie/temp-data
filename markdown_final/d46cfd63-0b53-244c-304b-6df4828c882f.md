## Question

Lymph nodes and rash

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate lymphadenopathy with rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy and rash together. Then, I should categorize likely etiologies by pathophysiology. Next, I will prioritize high-yield differentials and red flags. After that, I will outline a stepwise diagnostic approach, including when to image and when to biopsy. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical decision framework with key takeaways anchored to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of concurrent lymphadenopathy and rash. This combination is common and broad, spanning infectious, autoimmune, drug-related, and neoplastic causes; importantly, it can signal serious disease, so I need to keep a low threshold for evaluation while avoiding premature closure. The presence of lymphadenopathy shifts pretest probabilities and should guide the breadth of the workup, particularly when nodes are generalized, persistent, or associated with systemic symptoms [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw].

> I will now examine the etiologic categories to anchor the differential. Infectious causes are most frequent and include viral illnesses such as Epstein-Barr virus, acute HIV, mpox, and rickettsial diseases; autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions like SLE, sarcoidosis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; drug-induced hypersensitivity such as DRESS; and neoplastic processes including lymphoma and metastatic disease. I should also remember that lymphadenopathy can be a manifestation of rheumatologic disease activity or a complication of immunosuppression, so I need to check for both simultaneously [^116EJVzK] [^116MnaDB] [^112BWr6h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should prioritize high-yield differentials based on epidemiology, exposure risks, and clinical phenotype. In adolescents and young adults with sore throat and posterior cervical nodes, infectious mononucleosis is common and lymphadenopathy is a hallmark. In patients with recent high-risk exposures or compatible symptoms, acute HIV infection must be considered. Mpox presents with fever and lymphadenopathy followed by a centrifugal, deep-seated rash and should be distinguished from varicella. Rickettsial infections often bring fever, rash, and regional lymphadenopathy, sometimes with an eschar. And DRESS can present with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and organ involvement, so I need to check medications carefully [^111L39fR] [^116912ug] [^115EtKQe] [^1128a8gp] [^116JSfie].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that mandate expedited workup. Generalized lymphadenopathy, nodes larger than 2 cm, hard or fixed consistency, supraclavicular location, persistence beyond 4 weeks without explanation, and systemic B symptoms increase the likelihood of malignancy or serious disease and should prompt imaging and consideration of biopsy. I should also remember that epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm are abnormal and warrant evaluation. In children, ultrasound is first-line for persistent peripheral lymphadenopathy to characterize nodes and guide next steps [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw] [^111TzYE4].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach in a stepwise fashion. Let me first confirm the history elements I must elicit: node chronology and distribution, associated symptoms, exposures including travel, animals, sexual contacts, and drugs, and vaccination history including COVID-19, which can cause ipsilateral axillary nodes. On exam, I need to distinguish localized from generalized nodes, assess size, consistency, fixation, and tenderness, and inspect the skin rash morphology and distribution. Initial labs should include CBC with differential, ESR/CRP, and targeted testing based on suspicion such as HIV RNA/Duo, EBV serologies, RPR, and TB testing. Imaging with ultrasound helps characterize nodes, while chest radiography is indicated for mediastinal or hilar disease or suspected sarcoidosis. If red flags are present or nodes persist beyond 4 weeks without a benign diagnosis, I should proceed to excisional or core biopsy rather than fine-needle aspiration when lymphoma is suspected [^116EJVzK] [^114rtnns] [^113wGzNw].

> I need to ensure I consider special populations and mimics. In children, most lymphadenopathy is benign and viral, but I should maintain vigilance for Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, and malignancy. In pregnancy and postpartum, physiologic changes and lactation-related breast edema can complicate evaluation, so I should tailor imaging and follow-up. In immunocompromised patients, opportunistic infections and lymphoproliferative disorders rise on the list, and I should have a lower threshold for biopsy. Travel history can pivot the differential toward rickettsioses, Zika, or Q fever, so I should ask explicitly about exposures and timing [^112YtB8B] [^114rtnns] [^1128a8gp] [^114vt7LF].

> But wait, what if the rash and nodes reflect a systemic autoinflammatory syndrome rather than infection or malignancy. Schnitzler syndrome presents with chronic urticarial rash, fever, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy; recognizing this changes management toward IL-1 blockade. Similarly, HIDS due to MVK mutations causes recurrent fevers with rash and lymphadenopathy; measuring IgD and genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy. I should double-check for these when episodes are recurrent and inflammatory markers are persistently elevated [^114oXUQm] [^1172R7t1].

> Let me reconsider the role of drugs, because missing DRESS would be consequential. Anticonvulsants such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and ethosuximide, as well as allopurinol and sulfonamides, can cause DRESS with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and organ injury; early features may precede rash, so I should stop the culprit drug promptly if suspected and avoid corticosteroids until infection is reasonably excluded. Histologically, DRESS lymphadenopathy can mimic lymphoma, reinforcing the need for expert hematopathology review and, when uncertain, T-cell receptor studies to distinguish polyclonal reactions from clonal lymphomas [^1148GHZe] [^117KRpdX].

> I should double-check the mpox nuances because presentation evolved in recent outbreaks. Classically, mpox features a prodrome with fever and lymphadenopathy followed by a centrifugal rash with synchronous progression; however, clade IIb outbreaks often show anogenital-first lesions with asynchronous evolution and lymphadenopathy that may be less reliable, so I must integrate exposure risks and lesion morphology rather than relying on timing alone. Oral lesions are common and can aid diagnosis, and coinfections with STIs are frequent, so concurrent testing is prudent [^115EtKQe] [^1122M7to] [^1152b4X1].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to biopsy and what studies to request. If nodes are large, hard, fixed, supraclavicular, or persist beyond 4 weeks without a benign diagnosis, excisional or core biopsy provides architecture for lymphoma subtyping and excludes granulomatous or metastatic disease. I need to ensure the pathology request includes flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and, when lymphoma is suspected, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies. If DRESS is in the differential, I should ask for eosinophil-rich patterns and vasculitis, and correlate with drug exposure history [^116EJVzK] [^117KRpdX].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. If the patient has acute, localized nodes with a compatible viral illness and a benign exam, observation with reassurance is reasonable. If nodes are generalized, larger than 2 cm, hard or fixed, supraclavicular, or persist beyond 4 weeks, I should obtain targeted labs and imaging and proceed to biopsy. If there is a drug exposure or organ dysfunction, I should consider DRESS and stop the drug. If there are red flags for malignancy or autoimmune disease, I should expedite specialty referral. And if the patient is a child, I should prioritize ultrasound and pediatric-specific differentials while maintaining vigilance for serious disease [^116EJVzK] [^111TzYE4].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aware approach: define node distribution and character, characterize the rash, screen for exposures and drugs, order targeted labs, image judiciously, and biopsy when red flags emerge. By anchoring to high-quality sources and keeping a broad but prioritized differential, I can avoid missed diagnoses of HIV, mpox, DRESS, lymphoma, and autoinflammatory syndromes while preventing unnecessary testing in benign, self-limited disease [^116EJVzK] [^116912ug] [^115EtKQe] [^1148GHZe].

Lymphadenopathy with rash is a **high-yield clinical pairing** that signals systemic disease and demands a structured approach [^116EJVzK]. The most common causes are **infectious** (HIV, EBV, mpox, rickettsial infections, secondary syphilis) [^116912ug] [^111L39fR] [^115EtKQe] [^1128a8gp] [^116y1FGG], **autoimmune** (SLE, sarcoidosis, Kawasaki disease, systemic JIA) [^114fZFaH] [^115hhT2V] [^1157T4EM] [^116Jwzks], and **drug-induced** (DRESS) [^1148GHZe] [^117KRpdX]. Red flags include **persistent nodes > 4 weeks**, **hard/fixed nodes**, **systemic B symptoms**, or **supraclavicular/epitrochlear involvement** [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw]. Initial workup should include CBC, ESR/CRP, HIV testing, RPR, and targeted imaging; biopsy is indicated for unexplained nodes > 4 weeks or when malignancy is suspected [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw]. Management is cause-specific: treat infections, stop offending drugs, and use immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease [^116EJVzK] [^1148GHZe].

## Drug-induced etiologies

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (**DRESS**) presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and organ involvement (hepatitis, nephritis) [^1148GHZe]; diagnosis relies on **clinical features**, **RegiSCAR**, and drug exposure history [^1148GHZe]. Common triggers include anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, carbamazepine), allopurinol, and sulfonamides [^116JSfie] [^112TMrVR].

## Red flag features requiring urgent evaluation

- **Persistent lymphadenopathy > 4 weeks** without resolution [^116EJVzK]
- **Hard, fixed, or matted nodes** [^116EJVzK]
- **Supraclavicular or epitrochlear nodes** [^116EJVzK]
- **Systemic B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^116EJVzK]
- **Rapidly progressive rash** or mucosal involvement [^notfound]

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach begins with a **focused history** covering onset, exposures, travel, drugs, and systemic symptoms, followed by a **physical exam** to characterize nodes and rash [^116EJVzK]. Initial laboratory tests include CBC, ESR/CRP, HIV testing, RPR, EBV serology, and targeted tests based on suspicion [^116EJVzK]. Imaging with ultrasound is first-line for persistent nodes; chest X-ray is used for mediastinal disease or sarcoidosis [^111TzYE4] [^115hhT2V]. Excisional or core biopsy is indicated for unexplained nodes > 4 weeks or when malignancy is suspected [^116EJVzK].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**: treat infections with appropriate antimicrobials, discontinue offending drugs in DRESS with supportive care, and use immunomodulatory therapy (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, DMARDs, biologics) for autoimmune disease [^116EJVzK] [^1148GHZe]. Supportive care includes analgesics, antipyretics, and patient education on warning signs and follow-up [^notfound].

Mpox — clade II clinical presentation during the 2022 outbreak features mild or absent prodromal symptoms that have not always preceded the rash, rash commonly at anogenital or oropharyngeal/perioral sites with involvement of limbs, face, and trunk, lesions that may be single or multiple, limited to one body site and progressing asynchronously, and lymphadenopathy that can be present but is less reliable than classic presentations.

### Lymphadenopathy at the crossroad between immunodeficiency and autoinflammation: an intriguing challenge [^1172R7t1]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

HIDS, caused by mutations of the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene, usually shows onset during the first year of life, and most of the patients present to clinical attention before the fifth year of life. Patients with HIDS experience recurrent episodes of fever occurring every 2–8 weeks with a duration of 3–7 days, associated with a wide spectrum of symptoms such as abdominal pain, cutaneous rash, arthralgia or arthritis. In most patients, during the febrile episodes lymphadenopathy is present, mainly in the cervical region, and can be accompanied by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Differently from PFAPA syndrome, which usually resolves in scholar age, a significant percentage of patients with HIDS continue to experience febrile episodes and the associated signs and symptoms after adolescent age. During the episodes, an elevation of inflammatory markers, including serum amyloid protein, is observed, while the levels of serum cytokines (IL‐1β, IL‐6) also remain elevated in many cases in the intercritic phase. Elevated levels of IgD are highly suggestive for HIDS but can be absent in some patients, thus not representing a sensible biomarker.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111BfqA5]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent clinical finding in rheumatology practice and can often be interpreted as a clinical marker of disease activity. Moreover, lymphadenopathy can be the initial or more prominent manifestation of rare rheumatologic diseases, such as IgG4-RD and CD, the complications of which are potentially life-threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment of these diseases may significantly impact on mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, since rheumatologic patients are at higher risk of infectious and neoplastic complications, a careful differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders including RA, SLE and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111L39fR]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Complete diGeorge syndrome: development of rash, lymphadenopathy, and oligoclonal T cells in 5 cases [^1116uKmp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Five patients with DiGeorge syndrome presented with infections, skin rashes, and lymphadenopathy after the newborn period. T-cell counts and function varied greatly in each patient. Initial laboratory testing did not suggest athymia in these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the patients had significant immunodeficiency.

Methods

Research testing of peripheral blood included immunoscope evaluation of T-cell receptor beta variable gene segment repertoire diversity, quantification of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles, and detection of naive T cells (expressing CD45RA and CD62L).

Results

The patients were classified as having DiGeorge syndrome on the basis of syndromic associations and heart, parathyroid, and immune abnormalities. Immunoscope evaluation revealed that the T-cell repertoires were strikingly oligoclonal in all patients. There were few recent thymic emigrants, as indicated by the very low numbers of naive T cells (< 50/mm³) and the absence of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles. These studies showed that all 5 patients were athymic. Two patients died, one from infection. No thymus was found during the complete autopsy performed on one patient.

Conclusion

Patients with DiGeorge syndrome, skin rash, and lymphadenopathy should undergo analysis of naive T-cell numbers and of T-cell receptor beta variability segment repertoire to determine whether they are athymic, even if they have T cells with mitogen responsiveness. It is important for physicians to realize that patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome remain profoundly immunodeficient after development of these atypical features (rash, lymphadenopathy, and oligoclonal T cells). Prompt diagnosis is necessary for appropriate management.

### Slowly progressive chest rash in an elderly woman [^112zoshZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old woman with remote history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy presented to the dermatology department for eczema on her legs. Incidentally, breast skin changes were noted on examination, and she admitted to approximately 1 year of thickening, itchy breast skin. Her left breast was markedly indurated with hyperpigmented brown-to-erythematous plaques, subtle peau d'orange appearance, and shotty left axillary lymphadenopathy (Fig 1, A). She declined biopsy and treatment at that time. Fifteen months later, her rash had slowly progressed (Fig 1, B), with erythematous nodules spreading medially and superiorly on her chest skin. She remained otherwise well, living independently.

Question 1: What is this patient's most likely diagnosis?
A. Metastatic breast cancer
B. Metastatic lung cancer
C. Lymphedema
D. Eczema
E. Cellulitis
Answers:
A. Metastatic breast cancer – Correct. The patient's markedly indurated skin and axillary lymphadenopathy are consistent with carcinoma en cuirasse, a form of breast cancer metastatic to skin with infiltrative disease causing firm "cuirasse" or "armorlike" changes. Further history showed that 17 months before her initial dermatology visit, the patient had had a mammogram highly suspicious for recurrent carcinoma, and 9 months prior, a left breast tissue and skin biopsy showed invasive lobular carcinoma estrogen receptor (ER) + /progesterone receptor (PR) + /human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) − (Fig 2).
B. Metastatic lung cancer – Incorrect. Less often, the primary malignancy in patients with carcinoma en cuirasse may be from lung, oral mucosa, gastric, or colorectal cancer. Compared with breast cancer, in lung and gastrointestinal cancer, cutaneous metastases occur earlier and are more likely to be associated with visceral metastases that worsen prognosis.
C. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Fifteen years ago, the patient's breast cancer was treated with lumpectomy and partial mastectomy of the left breast, after which she declined chemotherapy and radiation. The timing of her symptoms and induration rather than edema on examination make infiltrative malignancy more likely than lymphedema.
D. Eczema – Incorrect. Although the patient complained of itch, the morphology findings show minimal epidermal change (no scale). Further, the distribution of the rash by the previous site of breast cancer makes this case more concerning for recurrent carcinoma.
E. Cellulitis – Incorrect. Although inflammatory metastatic breast cancer may mimic cellulitis (carcinoma erysipeloides), the timing (> 1 year), lack of symptoms (no pain, no warmth), and overall appearance make cellulitis unlikely.

### Zika virus infection presenting with postauricular lymphadenopathy [^111KktM2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Since 2015, ZIKV is rapidly emerging within the Americas, where it is disseminated by mosquitos of the Aedes genus. However, the virus is also transmitted by blood transfusion and, as recently suggested, by contact with infectious semen. Because of its possible association with fetal malformations and neurological complications, this epidemic has been declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization. The clinical presentation of the infection is similar to dengue including fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis, myalgia, headache, and vomiting.–Although lymphadenopathy has recently been described in patients with ZIKV infection in Brazil, it is usually not listed as a typical manifestation. Our case confirms that ZIKV might cause systemic lymphadenopathy including the posterior auricular lymph nodes. Because tender bilateral postauricular lymphadenopathy is a known clinical sign of postnatal rubella, it might mislead ZIKV diagnosis especially in pediatric patients.

### Ulceronecrotic rash in an immunocompetent individual [^111r96to]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of a pustular rash that began on her ankles and spread upward. Two weeks prior to presentation, she began experiencing eye redness, swelling, and vision loss with enlarged lymph nodes and fatigue. Examination revealed ulcerated papules and plaques involving the face, shins, knees, and thighs (Fig 1). The palms and soles were spared. Postauricular and cervical lymphadenopathy was present, and there was bilateral periorbital edema with conjunctival injection (Fig 2). Punch biopsy demonstrated a lichenoid granulomatous dermatitis with plasma cells (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pityriasis lichenoides
B. Malignant syphilis
C. Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T cell lymphoma
D. Ecthyma
E. Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME)

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### Diffuse lymphadenopathy and fever without a rash: an atypical presentation of secondary syphilis [^116y1FGG]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 30s presented to the emergency department with 4days of fever, headache and back pain. The patient was admitted for pain control, inability to tolerate oral intake and intravenous antibiotics for presumed diagnosis of pyelonephritis. Following admission, CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed multiple prominent pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes, and the patient was noted to have anterior and posterior cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy on examination. The differential diagnosis was broadened to infectious, haematological, malignant and autoimmune aetiologies of diffuse lymphadenopathy. Workup included serum studies, imaging, lumbar puncture and lymph node biopsy. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) returned positive with titre 1:16 and confirmatory reactive Treponema pallidum particle agglutination. With an otherwise unrevealing workup, the diagnosis of secondary syphilis was confirmed. This case highlights the differential and diagnostic approach for diffuse lymphadenopathy and an unusual presentation of secondary syphilis. Additionally, it indicates that secondary syphilis can be present even with a relatively low RPR titre.

### American College of Rheumatology clinical guidance for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 and hyperinflammation in pediatric COVID-19: version 3 [^116Ts6eo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for multisystem inflammatory syndrome, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, ACR 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that MIS-C and Kawasaki disease may share overlapping clinical features, including conjunctival infection, oropharyngeal findings (red and/or cracked lips, strawberry tongue), rash, swollen and/or erythematous hands and feet, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^113aDEWh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Kawasaki disease: summary of the American Heart Association guidelines [^1157T4EM]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis of childhood that predominantly affects the coronary arteries. The etiology of Kawasaki disease remains unknown, although an infectious agent is strongly suspected based on clinical and epidemiologic features. A genetic predisposition is also likely, based on varying incidences among ethnic groups, with higher rates in Asians. Symptoms include fever, conjunctival injection, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Some children with Kawasaki disease develop coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, ischemic heart disease, and sudden death. Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in developed countries.

### West nile virus: a primer for the otolaryngologist [^117VGbha]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since recognition in the United States with a 1999 New York City epidemic, West Nile virus has enduringly migrated westward, leaving few states unaffected. Infection rates are rising at an alarming rate, doubling every year since introduction, with more than 9800 cases in 2003 alone and more than 260 deaths. Patients may present with myriad symptoms including a maculopapular rash that affects the face and trunk and diffuse lymphadenopathy, both of which may result in the initial consultation of the otolaryngologist. We review the clinical history of West Nile virus and its epidemiology, laboratory findings, and variable clinical presentation, with an emphasis on otolaryngologic manifestations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING COMPREHENSIVE: review of the literature over the past 50 years with an emphasis on what the present-day otolaryngologist needs to know concerning West Nile virus. Clinical manifestations of the head and neck such as encephalitis, meningitis, maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy and dysphagia are discussed.

Results

To date, there are no articles in the otolaryngology literature discussing West Nile virus. These patients may present initially to multiple providers in diverse specialties because of multifarious initial signs and symptoms. The otolaryngologist must be educated on this quickly growing affliction and practice with a high index of suspicion.

Conclusions

In this article we describe the clinical manifestations of West Nile virus, with an emphasis on the otolaryngologic manifestations. The otolaryngologist must become educated about this entity to facilitate preventative measures, adequately treat, and assist other providers in hopeful control and potential eradication of this infectious threat.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111i6mYe]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human herpesvirus-8 disease — clinical manifestations notes that most individuals latently infected with HHV-8 are asymptomatic, while immunocompetent children and organ transplant recipients may develop a primary infection syndrome with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, bone marrow failure, and occasional rapid progression to Kaposi sarcoma (KS). KS manifestations vary widely, with most patients having nontender, hyperpigmented, macular or nodular skin lesions; oral lesions occur in approximately one-third of patients and are predictors of pulmonary involvement and less favorable treatment outcomes. Lymphatic involvement is also common and may lead to debilitating lower extremity edema, and involvement of internal viscera occurs in up to 50% of cases.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### A 40-year-old man with multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody reveals an unexpected diagnosis [^115651tq]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 40-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the ED with a 2-day history of right-sided chest pain accompanied by night sweats and chills. These symptoms were accompanied by a dry, nonproductive cough without hemoptysis. The patient worked as an air traffic controller, with a side business of buying, renovating, and selling houses. He takes part in the remodeling work himself but denies any exposure to animal droppings, bird droppings, or mold. He denied chronic sinus disease, rash, or arthralgias. A resident of Platte City, Missouri, he had recently traveled to Salt Lake City, Utah. At the time of presentation, the patient denied any fever or shortness of breath. He had no history of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substance use and denied any recent weight loss.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of HHV-8 and KS — Primary infection in young, immunocompetent children may be asymptomatic or present as a self-limited mononucleosis-like illness with fever, mild upper respiratory symptoms, and a maculopapular rash, with a similar presentation in immunocompetent adults; immunocompromised patients may have more severe disseminated infection with fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, and reactivation has been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in HIV-infected adults; KS presentation varies widely with cutaneous, oral, lymphatic, or visceral involvement, alone or in combination, and pediatric presentations differ from adults, being best described in retrospective cohort studies from sub-Saharan Africa.

### Does this adult patient have early HIV infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^117C3f5r]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Timely identification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults can contribute to reduced mortality and likelihood of further HIV transmission. During the first 6 months after infection, known as early HIV infection, patients often report a well-described constellation of symptoms and signs. However, the literature examining utility of the clinical examination in identifying early infection has not been systematically assessed.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of symptoms and signs in identifying early HIV infection among adults.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (1981-May, 2014) for articles investigating symptoms and signs of early HIV infection in adults and searched reference lists of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

We retained original studies that compared symptoms and signs among patients with early HIV infection in comparison to HIV-negative individuals.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted and used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs), and meta-analysis was used to calculate summary LRs.

Results

Of 1356 studies, 16 studies included data that were eligible for meta-analysis and included a total of 24,745 patients and 1253 cases of early HIV infection. Symptoms that increased the likelihood of early HIV infection the most included genital ulcers (LR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.5–12), weight loss (LR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1–7.2), vomiting (LR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.5–8.0), and swollen lymph nodes (LR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.3–8.0). No symptoms had an LR that was 0.5 or lower, but the absence of recent fever (LR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.84) slightly decreased the likelihood of early HIV infection. The presence of lymphadenopathy on physical examination was the most useful sign (LR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0–5.2). No sign had an LR of 0.5 or less, but the absence of lymphadenopathy slightly decreased the likelihood of early HIV infection (LR, 0.70, 95% CI, 0.49–0.92). Using data from studies that considered combinations of findings (range of possible findings, 4–17), the summary LR for individuals with 0 findings was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.38–0.58).

Conclusions and Relevance

The limited utility of the clinical examination to detect or rule out early HIV infection highlights the importance of routine testing for HIV infection among adults.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical and laboratory manifestations — HIV increases the frequency and severity of clinical malaria episodes in more severely immunosuppressed adults, pregnant women, and older children, but in young children there is no clear evidence that HIV infection is associated with more severe malaria disease. In a case series of returning travelers, symptoms most commonly reported include fever (100%), headache (100%), weakness (94%), profuse night sweats (91%), insomnia (69%), arthralgias (59%), myalgias (56%), diarrhea (13%), and abdominal cramps (8%); severe malaria may present before severe anemia (hemoglobin < 7 g/dL) is documented, rash, lymphadenopathy, and signs of pulmonary consolidation are not characteristic of malaria, and although fever is often the most common clinical presentation of malaria in people coming from areas of endemic malaria transmission, it is not uniformly present in children.

### Polyarthritis in a child with rosai-dorfman disease [^115xM4ct]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old boy presented with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and polyarthritis. Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis was initially considered in the differential diagnosis, but lymph node biopsy established the diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD). The arthritis recurred twice. Both times it correlated with the severity of the other clinical and laboratory abnormalities of RDD and responded to treatment with dexamethasone and vinblastine. This report adds inflammatory arthritis to the extranodal manifestations of RDD in children and suggests that this disorder should be considered as a rare cause of fever with rash, lymphadenopathy and arthritis.

### Kikuchi disease with facial rash and erythema multiforme [^1134dn8K]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Kikuchi disease, or histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a benign illness characterized by fever and cervical lymphadenopathy predominantly in young women. It has a self-limiting course. Skin changes occur in about one-third of patients and are of a nonspecific nature. A case of Kikuchi disease with cutaneous involvement in the guise of erythema multiforme and a facial rash is reported. The differential diagnosis with systemic lupus erythematosus and Rowell syndrome is discussed.

### Cases from the Osler medical service at johns hopkins university [^114zLvVb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

PRESENTING FEATURES: An 18-year-old white man was admitted to the Osler Medical Service with the chief complaint of back pain. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient developed diffuse and aching upper back pain. Over the next couple of days, he also developed severe anterior chest pain that was somewhat pleuritic in nature but diffuse and extending bilaterally into the shoulders. One week prior to admission, he developed intermittent fevers and night sweats. The patient denied any lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, sick contacts, shortness of breath, rash, or bleeding. He was seen by a physician and told that he had thrombocytopenia. There was no history of recent or remote unusual bleeding episodes. His medical history was unremarkable except for a childhood diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He was not taking any medications and had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Physical examination showed that he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. He was a well-appearing man who was lying still because of pain. HEENT examination was unremarkable. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudates. His lungs were clear. His neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy. Examination of his back and chest revealed no focal tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and his skin was without petechiae or rashes. Examination of the patient's joints showed pain on passive and active movement of his shoulders bilaterally, but no frank arthritis. There was no rash, petechiae, or echymoses. Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. On admission, the laboratory examination was notable for a hematocrit level of 32.5%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 79 fL, and white blood cell count of 2.8 x 10³/microL. Platelet count was 75 x 10³/microL. A white blood cell differential revealed 7% bands, 53% polys, 34% lymphs, 5% atypical lymphocytes, 2% nucleated red cells, and a few young unidentified cells. His chemistry studies were unremarkable. What is the diagnosis?

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and granulomatous lymphadenopathy [^114fZFaH]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

SLE is a chronic autoimmune disorder which is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels and connective tissue involving multiple systems and presence of circulating autoantibodies especially ANA and Anti-dsDNA antibodies. SLE is relatively uncommon in children and estimated incidence ranges from 10 to 20 per 100 000 children depending on the ethnic population.

Children and adolescents represent 15–20% of all patients with SLE. Females are affected three to five times more often than males. SLE is well known to present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Children with SLE may present with constitutional symptoms (fatigue, myalgia, weakness, weight loss), skin rashes, especially malar rash or arthralgia/arthritis that may precede the detection of organ-specific lesion.

Prevalence of lymphadenopathy has been reported in 23–34% of patients with SLE with a female preponderance. Despite being frequent manifestation, lymphadenopathy is not included in the ACR criteria for the diagnosis of SLE. Lymphadenopathy has even been reported as the first clinical manifestation of SLE in children. Lymphadenopathy is very common in children due to variety of etiologies and hence may pose a delay in the diagnosis of SLE.

Lymph nodes in SLE are usually soft, non tender, mobile, generalized and of varying size. We also observed similar findings in our patient. On histopathology, coagulative necrosis with hematoxylin bodies is specific to lupus lymphadenitis but is rarely observed. More commonly lymph node biopsies in SLE show reactive follicular hyperplasia which is considered a nonspecific feature. Atypical lymphoproliferation found in the lymph node biopsies of SLE were classified as reactive follicular hyperplasia with giant follicles, aspects similar to Castelman's disease, atypical paracortical hyperplasia with lymphoid follicles, and atypical immunoblastic and lymphoplasmacytic proliferation. A classification system with three patterns of histopathological features of lupus lymphadenitis had been proposed, however they did not appear to be highly specific for SLE. The occurrence of variety of histopathological features poses diagnostic difficulty and should be differentiated from lymphoproliferative disorders. This patient had undergone bone marrow examination which was normal.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^112cSXw1]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) for acute respiratory distress in the setting of 5 months of recurrent and worsening rash with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. At the onset of his rash, he and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the patient's rash recurred, prompting his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened, so amoxicillin was stopped; a prednisone course was prescribed which alleviated the rash. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely with associated symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Because of these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC, where his vitals were notable for tachypnea and tachycardia. His initial EC imaging workup was remarkable for an echocardiogram with a mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, chest x-ray (CXR) with a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography significant for prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results were notable for elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. Differential diagnosis remained broad, including infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

### Signs and symptoms of untreated Lyme disease… [^116bmZV4]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Untreated Lyme disease can produce a wide range of symptoms, depending on the stage of infection. These include fever, rash, facial paralysis, an irregular heartbeat, and arthritis.
- Seek medical attention if you observe any of these symptoms and have recently had a tick bite, live in an area known for Lyme disease, or have recently traveled to an area where Lyme disease occurs. Signs and symptoms Early signs and symptoms
- Fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes may occur in the absence of rash
- **Erythema migrans rash**:
- Occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected people
- Begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3 to 30 days.
- Expands gradually over several days reaching up to 12 inches or more across
- May feel warm to the touch but is rarely itchy or painful
- Sometimes clears as it enlarges, resulting in a target or "bull's-eye" appearance
- May appear on any area of the body
- Does not always appear as a "classic bull's-eye" rash
- Occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected people. Reminder Seek medical attention if you observe any of these symptoms and have had a recent tick bite, live in an area known for Lyme disease, or have recently traveled to an area where Lyme disease occurs. More about rashes
- A small bump or redness at the site of a tick bite that occurs immediately and resembles a mosquito bite, is common. This irritation generally goes away in 1–2 days and is not a sign of Lyme disease.
- A rash with a very similar appearance to EM occurs with Southern Tick-associated Rash Illness but is not Lyme disease.
- Ticks can spread other organisms that may cause a different type of rash.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and granulomatous lymphadenopathy [^114vHQk3]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is known to present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Lymphadenopathy is frequently observed in children with SLE and may occasionally be the presenting feature. SLE presenting with granulomatous changes in lymph node biopsy is rare. These features may also cause diagnostic confusion with other causes of granulomatous lymphadenopathy.

Case Presentation

We report 12 year-old female who presented with generalized lymphadenopathy associated with intermittent fever as well as weight loss for three years. She also had developed anasarca two years prior to presentation. On presentation, she had growth failure and delayed puberty. Lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous features. She developed a malar rash, arthritis and positive ANA antibodies over the course of next two months and showed WHO class II lupus nephritis on renal biopsy, which confirmed the final diagnosis of SLE. She was started on oral prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine with which her clinical condition improved, and she is currently much better under regular follow up.

Conclusion

Generalized lymphadenopathy may be the presenting feature of SLE and it may preceed the other symptoms of SLE by many years as illustrated by this patient. Granulomatous changes may rarely be seen in lupus lymphadenitis. Although uncommon, in children who present with generalized lymphadenopathy along with prolonged fever and constitutional symptoms, non-infectious causes like SLE should also be considered as a diagnostic possibility.

### A 44-year-old man with a solitary, slowly enlarging mediastinal lesion [^115JiqyM]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 44-year-old man, who does not smoke, presented for investigation of a right mediastinum lesion as revealed on a routine radiograph that was performed as a requirement of his life insurance. The patient reported no associated symptoms. He did not report shortness of breath, cough, sputum, fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. The remaining review of symptoms was also negative for issues such as muscle weakness, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, skin rash, and visible, palpable, or painful lymphadenopathy. His medical history was unremarkable, and he did not receive any regular medication. The patient's professional occupation was not related to special exposure and he did not report alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, or any recent travel.

### Schnitzler syndrome [^113LZXBJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her late 40s with a history of psoriatic arthritis presented to us with fever, migratory rash, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and generalised myalgia. Her symptoms did not improve with steroids and her inflammatory markers were in the range of 200mg/dL for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 71mm/hour and ferritin of 4000ng/mL. Infectious workup was negative. Haematological malignancy and autoimmune conditions were among the top differentials, and she was eventually diagnosed with Schnitzler syndrome. A multidisciplinary team consisting of internal medicine, rheumatology, infectious disease and haematology-oncology specialists was involved in the care of this patient. We highlight the diagnostic schema that was followed for this rare and unique constellation of symptoms.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^1128a8gp]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Rickettsial diseases in travelers — clinical presentations and red flags are outlined for African tick bite fever, scrub typhus, murine typhus, ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis, and sennetsu fever. African tick bite fever is typically milder than other spotted fever group rickettsioses, and it should be suspected in a patient who presents with fever, headache, myalgia, and an eschar after recent travel to Sub-Saharan Africa or the Caribbean; regional lymphadenopathy is also common, and many patients may not remember a tick bite and not all will present with eschars. Scrub typhus presents with fever, headache, and myalgia; lymphadenopathy, respiratory symptoms, encephalitis, and eschars may also occur, with respiratory symptoms present in approximately two-thirds of patients and severity ranging from mild cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome; scrub typhus can be fatal if not treated appropriately. Patients with murine typhus usually present with a moderately severe but often otherwise non-specific febrile illness; approximately half of patients will develop a maculopapular rash, generally appearing on the trunk, and the fever can persist for up to 2 weeks in the absence of treatment; although generally less severe than Rocky Mountain spotted fever or scrub typhus, patients can develop organ failure or require hospitalization, and death can occur in some cases. Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis also present as a non-specific febrile illness and are less commonly reported in travelers; cytopenias, particularly leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, are common and should heighten suspicion, and rash may be seen in some children with ehrlichiosis, but rash is not a feature of anaplasmosis. Sennetsu fever presents with fever, weakness, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, resembling infectious mononucleosis, and although rarely reported in endemic regions, serologic evidence suggests it may be an underrecognized cause of fever in these regions.

### Ethosuximide-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms with mediastinal lymphadenopathy [^115QEE7R]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common sign for drug reaction and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, but hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be underreported. We describe a 7-year-old boy who started taking ethosuximide for absence seizures and presented with diffuse rash, fever, elevated transaminases, facial swelling, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. His mediastinal lymphadenopathy was concerning for lymphoma, which led to more invasive testing to rule out malignancy. This report highlights an unusual and likely underreported presenting sign of DRESS syndrome in children.

### DRESS syndrome: an important differential for eosinophilia with systemic organ dysfunction [^1148GHZe]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Drug rash occurring with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome is a potentially fatal adverse drug reaction that requires immediate action in order to minimise patient harm. Initially implicated with the use of anticonvulsants, it has also been shown to be caused by many other medications but less frequently with vancomycin. Patients typically present with fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and systemic organ dysfunction. Diagnosis is aided using probability calculators such as RegiSCAR (Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction), as well as clinical response on removing the responsible medication. Here, we present a case without any systemic organ dysfunction that improved with withdrawal of the offending drug vancomycin.

### Acute arthritis, skin rash and lofgren's syndrome [^115hhT2V]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is an autoimmune multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology, which mainly affects the adults in the age group of 20–39 years. The disease can affect any organ in the body but mainly presents as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, cutaneous lesions, ocular manifestations and arthropathy. Lofgren's syndrome is an uncommon initial presentation of sarcoidosis which is recognised by the classical triad of acute arthritis, erythema nodosum and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. We describe a newly diagnosed case of sarcoidosis who presented as Lofgren's syndrome. Acute sarcoid arthritis should be kept as one of the differential diagnoses for patients presenting with acute arthritis and skin lesions; and chest X-ray should be considered to rule out bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy in these patients. Early suspicion and identification of classical clinical features are essential to establish early diagnosis.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^112ad1GH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Table 2
Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Table 3
Minimal work-up studies on chronic spontaneous urticaria *

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

### Ulceronecrotic rash in an immunocompetent individual [^113m5xqQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What condition is most often associated with this diagnosis?
A. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
B. Glucagonoma
C. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
D. HIV
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Answer:
A. EBV – Incorrect. The EBV causes infectious mononucleosis, which manifests as splenomegaly, pharyngitis, and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A morbilliform rash can occur following the administration of an aminopenicillin.
B. Glucagonoma – Incorrect. Glucagon-secreting tumors are associated with NME, which is described above.
C. IBD – Incorrect. IBD can be associated with erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), neither of which is seen here. EN does not ulcerate, and the presentation of PG is notable for ulcers with characteristic undermined edges and surrounding violaceous borders. EN is characterized by a septal granulomatous panniculitis, while established lesions of PG demonstrate ulceration and diffuse neutrophilic infiltrates.
D. HIV – Correct. Malignant syphilis is often associated with HIV infection or immunosuppression. In a systematic review of 45 patients from 2014 to 2018, 75% were HIV-positive. Decreased cell-mediated immunity, defective macrophage function, and a blunted humoral response in immunosuppressed patients enable greater virulence in T pallidum and subsequent severe clinical manifestations. The case presented here is notable in that the patient was healthy, without comorbidities or immunosuppression. All patients diagnosed with syphilis, including malignant syphilis, should be screened for HIV. Additionally, it is recommended that HIV-negative patients with neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis are offered HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, as syphilis is a significant risk factor for HIV infection.
E. SLE – Incorrect. Necrotic findings associated with SLE include antiphospholipid syndrome, which presents with retiform purpura and a thrombotic vasculopathy, and Rowell syndrome or cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrosis.

### Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) [^1152ZDGk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. HORIZANT is a prodrug of gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.

It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. HORIZANT should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

5.8 Tumorigenic Potential

In an oral carcinogenicity study, gabapentin enacarbil increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and carcinoma in male and female rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

In clinical studies of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2,085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence reported in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment.

### Establishment and analysis of a novel diagnostic model for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis based on machine learning [^114k5x2E]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Arthritis in SJIA is accompanied by clinical features such as fever, lymphadenopathy, rash, and serosal disease, and it develops rapidly and is prone to disability. In order to enhance and protect the quality of survival for children with SJIA, good prediction and identification are essential. However, the exact mechanism by which SJIA occurs is still unknown, and it is not a classic autoimmune disease, it has systemic inflammatory properties. Since there are currently no clear diagnostic criteria for SJIA, the diagnosis is typically made using a combination of clinical symptoms, serological tests, and imaging studies. As a rare disease, timely judgments are difficult to made in clinical diagnosis. On the genetic side, exploratory studies on biomarkers of SJIA are still of great value to go deeper. Therefore, it is essential to identify biomarkers that have a strong correlation with SJIA.

### Acute arthritis, skin rash and lofgren's syndrome [^114dR9bC]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology. In India, the prevalence of sarcoidosis is not well known and it varies from 10–12 cases/1000 new registrations to 61.2/100 000 as per the data reported by various centres across India. The disease can affect any organ in the body but mainly present as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, cutaneous and joint lesions. It is pathologically diagnosed by the presence of sterile non-caseating granulomas in the involved organs. Lofgren's syndrome is a form of acute manifestation of sarcoidosis which is seen in 5%–10% of patients with sarcoidosis. It is a self-limiting clinical entity which is characterised by the triad of hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum and acute sarcoid arthritis. Fever is also associated with Lofgren's syndrome and seen mainly in women. Erythema nodosum is more common in women than men who present with Lofgren's syndrome. Elevated peripheral blood ACE levels are seen in approximately 15% of patients with initial presentation of Lofgren's syndrome, and these patients usually have persistent arthritis. Diagnosis of Lofgren's syndrome made on the basis of classical clinical manifestations and the diagnostic triad has 95% specificity. Lofgren's syndrome is self-limiting and symptomatic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is adequate in almost all patients. Some patients may need additional therapy with corticosteroids. Therefore, acute sarcoid arthritis should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses for young patients with acute arthritis and rash. Chest X-ray to look for bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy can clinch the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in such patients.

### Mimics of monkeypox: considerations for the emergency medicine clinician [^115qBkqH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a public health emergency most commonly presenting with a painful rash and several systemic findings. However, there are several conditions that may mimic its presentation.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused overview of mpox mimics for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

Mpox is a global health emergency. The disease is primarily spread through contact, followed by the development of a centrifugally-spread rash that evolves from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. This is often associated with lymphadenopathy and fever. As the rash is one of the most common presenting signs of the infection, patients mpox may present to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. There are a variety of mimics of mpox, including smallpox, varicella, primary and secondary syphilis, acute retroviral syndrome, and genital herpes simplex virus.

Conclusion

Knowledge of mpox and its mimics is vital for emergency clinicians to differentiate these conditions and ensure appropriate diagnosis and management.

### Diffuse pruritic eruption and eosinophilia [^111Ze6wm]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most likely underlying systemic disease?
A. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome
B. Hodgkin lymphoma
C. Kimura disease
D. Lung Adenocarcinoma
E. Sarcoidosis

Answers:
A. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome – Incorrect. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is suspected when there is peripheral eosinophilia > 1500 μL, with or without marked tissue eosinophilia, presence of end organ damage, and absence of another explanation. Although hypereosinophilic syndrome commonly affects the skin and can show eczematous and lichenoid changes, this case did not meet the criteria and the lymph node biopsy was concerning for malignancy.
B. Hodgkin lymphoma – Correct. This patient presented with a paraneoplastic lichenoid rash and new onset peripheral eosinophilia. Massive lymphadenopathy and Reed–Sternberg cells on lymph node biopsy support this diagnosis. Peripheral eosinophilia has been reported in 15% of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases and may represent an early paraclinical sign. New onset eosinophilia especially within the first 3 months should raise the suspicion for HL.
C. Kimura disease – Incorrect. Kimura disease can also present with massive lymphadenopathy and peripheral eosinophilia. Lymph node histopathology is required to rule out Kimura disease. Reed–Sternberg cells are not seen in this inflammatory disorder.
D. Lung Adenocarcinoma – Incorrect. Lung cancer is very common and accounts for more than 10% of all malignancy; however paraneoplastic eosinophilia is extremely rare in solid organ malignancies and should prompt a workup to exclude a secondary hematologic malignancy or bone marrow disease. Chest X-ray and advanced imaging did not show pulmonary involvement and Reed–Sternberg cells are not seen in the lymph nodes of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.
E. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis can mimic lymphoma when presenting with hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms. Histology did not show granulomatous dermatitis. Reed–Sternberg cells are not seen in sarcoidosis.

### Atypical adult-onset Still's disease that fails to meet yamaguchi and fautrel criteria [^114ro6DP]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

This is a case of a young man with no significant medical history who presents with intermittent, twice-daily fever with night sweats, rash, dry cough and 7-pound weight loss over a 4-week period. The physical exam was remarkable for a salmon-coloured rash over the nose and cheeks, conjunctival pallor and objective hip flexor weakness. Labs showed normocytic anaemia, transaminitis, elevated acute inflammatory markers and elevated serum IL-10 and IL-6 levels. Chest and abdominal CT revealed mild hepatosplenomegaly without lymphadenopathy.

Recurrent daily fever of unknown origin (FUO) has a broad differential and can have either an autoimmune, autoinflammatory, infectious or neoplastic aetiology. According to a retrospective meta-analysis across 19 studies of FUO (n = 2667), non-infectious inflammatory disorders were diagnosed in 20.0% of cases (95% CI 17.0% to 23%), undiagnosed illness in 20.0% (95% CI 14.0% to 26.0%), cancer in 15.0% (95% CI 12.0% to 18.0%) and miscellaneous conditions in 6.0% (95% CI 4.0% to 8.0%).

5.3 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure

Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.

Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use.

Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine.

It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

Prior to initiation of treatment with Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately.

Head, neck, and skin findings — clinical features of infectious mononucleosis (IM): Lymphadenopathy in IM involves the posterior cervical chain more than the anterior chain, with nodes typically large and moderately tender, peaking early and subsiding over a 2- to 3-week period. Oropharyngeal assessment should consider other causes, including streptococci (coexistent in up to 30% of cases), gonococcus, and human immunodeficiency virus, and exudative pharyngitis is seen in more than 50% of patients with IM with marked tonsillar hyperplasia and exudation that may be white or gray-green or necrotic. Skin findings may include a maculopapular, urticarial, or petechial rash; rash is more common with concomitant ampicillin and has been described with azithromycin, levofloxacin, and cephalexin, and petechial rashes should alert providers to possible hematologic complications such as aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Acute arthritis, skin rash and lofgren's syndrome [^115AWGch]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder which is characterised by hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, sarcoid arthropathy, cutaneous manifestations and ocular complications. It usually affects the young adults in the age group of 20–39 years. Long-standing joint involvement in sarcoidosis is seen in 10%–15% of patients; however, acute arthritis in sarcoidosis is mostly seen as part of Lofgren's syndrome. Seen in 5%–10% of sarcoid cases, Lofgren's syndrome is characterised by the classical triad of acute arthritis, erythema nodosum and hilar lymphadenopathy. We hereby describe the case of a 44-year-old woman with sarcoidosis who presented with Lofgren's syndrome. Prompt recognition of such classical clinical presentation of sarcoidosis leads to early diagnosis and treatment.

The assessment of lymphadenopathy in children is a common diagnostic problem in pediatrics. An understanding of the wide variety of diseases and conditions that may present as lymphadenopathy is essential to determining the most appropriate work up for an individual patient. Although the majority of these children will prove to have a benign disorder, it is important that the pediatrician also have an appreciation for the malignant diseases that may present with lymphadenopathy, so that in such cases the diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening disease can be made in a timely manner.

### Acute arthritis, skin rash and lofgren's syndrome [^111uaaQ3]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

I was suffering from fever, joint pains and skin lesions for one month, when I came in contact with the treating team. I underwent multiple investigations which was quite anxiety-provoking for me. Then my treating team informed me that I am suffering from an uncommon disease known as sarcoidosis, and my symptoms are early features of my basic disease. They nicely explained me about the nature of the disease, its prognosis and future treatment plan. They advised me for regular follow up. I am very thankful to my treating team.

Learning points

This case presented with the classical triad of Lofgren's syndrome, that is, acute arthritis, erythema nodosum and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Acute sarcoid arthritis should be kept as differential of acute arthritis with skin lesions in young patients.
Chest X-ray should be done to see hilar lymphadenopathy in young patients with arthritis.
Strong clinical suspicion and prompt identification of classical clinical features can lead to early diagnosis and treatment.

### Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^116Jwzks]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a distinctive subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, characterized by fever and arthritis, often accompanied by rash, sometimes by generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and serositis. The diagnosis requires adequate exclusion of infectious, oncologic, autoimmune, and autoinflammatory diseases. Macrophage activation syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication of sJIA, requires prompt evaluation and treatment. Newer biologic agents, particularly interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 inhibitors, are highly effective and have transformed the treatment approach by reducing the use of systemic glucocorticoids. Primary care providers have a crucial role in monitoring children with sJIA for disease-related complications and medication-related adverse events.

### Rapid access multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic: analysis of 550 patients [^1127CGjH]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy (LA) is common and affects patients of all ages. An annual incidence of 0.6–0.7% has been estimated for the general population. Patients with lymphadenopathy present to a wide range of medical specialties. When physicians are faced with these patients, the critical tasks are to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes, to identify serious medical conditions that require specialist care, and to reassure patients with benign reactive lymphadenopathy or self-limiting diseases.

The possibility of malignancy raises the most concern among patients and health care professionals. Prompt referral for definitive investigations and treatment cannot be overstated, as cancer is perhaps the disease people fear most. Despite the incidences of many cancers being broadly similar in England compared with other European countries and the USA, the corresponding survival rates are poorer (Table 1

Table 1
Five-year relative survival of common cancers). To address this problem, the British government proposed, in September 2000, the National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan to provide a comprehensive strategy for bringing together prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care for cancer to improve survival. The current guideline recommends all patients with lymphadenopathy of more than 1 cm in size persisting for 6 weeks to be referred urgently for further evaluation.

Apart from cancer, there are also other medical conditions presenting with LA that will require urgent medical attention. This would include infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), both of which pose an important public health problem. In addition, immune-induced injury disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis will also require specialist care.

### Morphologic spectrum of lymphadenopathy in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome [^117KRpdX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a drug-induced, adverse T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that most often involves skin. The pathologic findings of DRESS-related lymphadenopathy have been described infrequently in the literature.

Objective —

To present a case series of DRESS-related lymphadenopathy with an emphasis on the morphologic spectrum.

Design —

We describe detailed clinical and pathologic findings along with the literature review. We focus on the differential diagnosis between DRESS lymphadenopathy and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL).

Results —

There were 4 men and 1 woman with a mean age of 41 years (range, 23–59 years). One patient (20%) died. Three lymph node biopsy specimens showed a pattern reminiscent of AITL (AITL-like pattern) and 2 cases showed necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi-like pattern), associated with vasculitis in 1 case. The AITL-like morphology of DRESS-related lymphadenopathy may be difficult to distinguish from genuine AITL. The clinical information is important for differential diagnosis, including history of drug exposure, age, and the rarity or absence of AITL-associated manifestations such as hemolytic anemia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Molecular analysis of the T-cell receptor genes is helpful, typically revealing a polyclonal pattern in DRESS-related lymphadenopathy.

Conclusions —

In the literature, 4 histologic patterns of DRESS lymphadenopathy have been described: reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, necrotizing lymphadenitis, Hodgkin lymphoma-like, and AITL-like. These patterns, particularly those that resemble lymphoma, highlight the importance of correct diagnosis to avoid unnecessary therapies.

Congenital and postnatal toxoplasmosis — clinical manifestations in infants and children indicate that in studies of non-immunocompromised infants with congenital toxoplasmosis, most infants (70%–90%) are asymptomatic at birth, yet most asymptomatic children develop late sequelae with onset ranging from several months to years after birth; manifestations include maculopapular rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, hematologic abnormalities, and central nervous system disease such as hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcification, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and seizures. Toxoplasmosis acquired after birth most often is initially asymptomatic, and when symptomatic can present with malaise, fever, sore throat, myalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and a mononucleosis-like syndrome with maculopapular rash and hepatosplenomegaly. TE should be considered in all HIV-infected children with new neurologic findings, but especially those with severe immunosuppression.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and other spotted fever group rickettsioses — key clinical features: RMSF is described as the most severe rickettsial illness in the United States, and delay in recognition and treatment is the most important factor associated with risk for death; early empiric therapy is the best way to prevent RMSF progression and resultant morbidity and mortality. The classic triad of fever, rash, and reported tick bite is rarely present at first presentation, and rash — present in most patients during the course of RMSF — can appear late or be atypical, localized, faint, evanescent, and difficult to recognize in persons with darker pigmented skin. Laboratory abnormalities that might occur include thrombocytopenia, increased immature neutrophils, elevations in hepatic transaminase levels, and hyponatremia, although laboratory findings are often within or slightly deviated from reference ranges early in illness. Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis is typically milder than RMSF with an inoculation eschar as the first manifestation in nearly all patients, and Rickettsia species 364D rickettsiosis has been described as a relatively mild illness characterized by eschar and regional lymphadenopathy.

Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use.

Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine.

It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately.

### Systemic autoinflammatory disease in adults [^112BWr6h]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic autoinflammatory disorders comprise an expanding group of rare conditions. They are mediated by dysfunction of the innate immune system and share a core of phenotypic manifestations including recurrent attacks of fever, cutaneous signs, chest or abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, vasculopathy, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Diagnosis is often established in childhood, but a growing number of adult patients are being recognized with systemic autoinflammatory disorders, including adult-onset disease. In this review, we provide a concise update on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approach of systemic autoinflammatory disorders with an emphasis on the adult patient population. Despite the recent advances in genetic testing, the diagnosis of autoinflammatory disease in adult patients is often based on a thorough knowledge of the clinical phenotype. Becoming acquainted with the clinical features of these rare disorders may assist in developing a high index of suspicion for autoinflammatory disease in patients presenting with unexplained episodes of fever or inflammation.

### Disease evolution in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: an international, observational cohort study through JIRcohort [^111xwrDh]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic disease that can remain active over several years resulting in significant morbidity for young adults with an impact on their social, professional and financial future. Although it has been established that there are three different types of disease evolution, information on the predictors of the disease course is limited. The present study was designed to describe the occurrence and clinical course of the different disease evolution types as well as to investigate the prognostic capacity of clinical features to better predict a chronic evolution.

First, these results show that our systemic JIA population presented all the three previously described disease evolution types: monophasic, polyphasic and persistent evolution. More than half of the patients were classified as having persistent disease (55.4%), followed by the monophasic group (35.4%), with only a small portion having a polyphasic evolution (9.2%). These findings are in line with the results from a prospective observational study that analyzed 45 patients treated in an academic rheumatology center in Canada between 1996 and 2000, but differ from a more recent retrospective study including 76 patients treated in Boston Children's Hospital between 1996 and 2015 were lower percentage of persistent disease course was reported. Because of the low number of patients in the polyphasic group, this group was combined with the monophasic one (non-persistent group) for the assessment of potential predictors for a persistent disease course.

Demographic features, such as age at disease onset, sex and time to follow-up, are consistent with findings in previous studies. Concerning clinical presentation, most children in this cohort presented initially with fever and/or arthritis, while other systemic symptoms such as cutaneous rash, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly or serositis were less frequent. These results are in agreement with a retrospective observation study that included 136 patients diagnosed with systemic from three tertiary rheumatology referral centers in the United States of America between 1990 and 2005, as well as with the previously reported retrospective study including 76 patients treated in Boston Children's Hospital besides rash that was among the most common symptoms following fever and arthralgia in this systemic JIA cohort.

Importantly, early disease onset (< 6 years old) was significantly more frequently observed in the persistent group and was identified as a presumed predictor of persistent disease evolution, in line with the results of Flato et al. indicating early disease onset as a risk factor for poor outcome in JIA. However, after adjusting for potential confounders this association was no longer statistically significant, highlighting the need of larger studies to address this question.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Murine typhus: an unlikely cause of cat scratch fever with ascending rash [^112ZLaky]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Murine typhus is an acute febrile illness characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a truncal rash, leading to hospitalization in 10% of patients. The typhus fever group of rickettsial agents includes R. typhi, R.prowazekii, and O. tsustugamushi. Murine typhus is caused by R. typhi and is also known as flea-borne typhus or endemic typhus. Transmission typically involves rodent vectors, but many patients never recall a specific exposure history.

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of murine typhus can result in a prolonged fever lasting weeks and may lead to end-organ damage or fatality if left untreated. Severe cases often present with early laboratory abnormalities, as observed in this patient. Murine typhus has been associated with secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, characterized by cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and splenomegaly, which were also present in this case. As with other rickettsial infections, doxycycline remains the mainstay of treatment.

Our patient presented with the symptomatic triad of headache, fever, and rash, a combination seen in only one-third of murine typhus cases, along with hallmark lab abnormalities. However, the ascending hand rash is an atypical presentation compared to the classically reported maculopapular rash on the trunk and extremities. The clinical presentation in this case shares features with other infectious diseases, such as the visual floaters and chorioretinitis seen in toxoplasmosis, and localized rash with lymphadenopathy characteristic of cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae. Additionally, the serologies may reflect potential cross-reactivity among different Rickettsial species titers.

The ophthalmologic manifestations of R. typhi seen in this case are rarely seen, but existing reports aided in reaching the diagnosis. Early fundoscopic examination and thorough skin examination can help refine the differential diagnosis while awaiting serologic results. Given the low risk associated with doxycycline, its administration is justified prior to confirmatory diagnosis of murine typhus, as early treatment can prevent serious complications, as evidenced by this case.

Diagnosis of murine typhus in this case may have been complicated and delayed by a positive viral test, concerns over potential acetaminophen-induced transaminitis, and recent travel history. While doxycycline effectively prevented end-organ damage, the patient experienced prolonged effects of R. typhi infection, including slowly resolving anemia and lymphadenopathy. This case represents a unique presentation of murine typhus, characterized by an identifiable mammal exposure, an atypical rash, systemic infection, and disseminated chorioretinitis.

### Oral manifestation of the monkeypox virus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152b4X1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis is the first study to estimate the pooled prevalence of oral manifestations among patients with mpox, to our knowledge. The pooled analysis included 4042 patients with mpox from 19 eligible studies from multiple countries between 1988 and 2022. The meta-analysis included 1775 patients from mpox-endemic countries (41.44%) and 2367 patients from non-endemic countries (58.56%). The pooled prevalence of oral manifestations among patients with mpox was estimated to be 36.75%.

A similar proportion of oral mucous membrane (39%) lesions was estimated in another meta-analysis that included six studies. Although a significant proportion, oral lesions were lower than mpox cardinal symptoms, such as a rash (93%–100%), fever (72%–96%), pruritis (65%) and lymphadenopathy (62%). Another review reported a 96% prevalence of oral ulcers as a symptom of mpox, including the overwhelming majority of patients from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Oral lesions were present regardless of the source of transmission (Human & Animal). The prevalence of oral lesions was not uniform between regions. Although African studies reported a higher prevalence of oral manifestations (45%–77.78%), most of the studies from the Americas and Europe reported a prevalence of less than 40%. This can be linked to the prevalence of high-risk contact and sexual practices (multiple sexual partners in the 12 weeks prior to the diagnosis of monkeypox or use of recreational drugs during sex) in behaviour, and high incidences of immunocompromised diseases such as HIV. Similar geographical variation in the prevalence of rashes, in general, was reported in another review. However, myalgias and lymphadenopathy did not show such variations between regions.

INTRODUCTION

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an endemic Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) in West and Central Africa. Most of the human infections reported each year are from the Congo Basin of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Monkeypox (MPX) disease presentation, including the characteristic rash, most closely resembles that of smallpox, an eradicated disease caused by a closely related OPXV. Monkeypox disease presentation is often confused with another febrile rash illness, varicella zoster virus (VZV). Previous evaluations of MPX laboratory-based surveillance have noted a large number of VZV infections among cases that were MPX negative, often in the same area where MPX cases occurred. –

Clinical diagnosis of MPX based on rash examination during the early macule and papule stages can be challenging. Key differences between MPX and VZV disease presentation at symptom onset and during illness progression can help to establish a presumptive diagnosis. Monkeypox patients often experience a febrile prodrome with high fever 1–4 days before rash onset, whereas a low-grade fever at rash onset is more common for VZV. Lymphadenopathy is also a distinguishing MPX characteristic. Lesions on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are often noted in MPX patients; although this feature is not recognized as a significant VZV characteristic, it has also been noted in VZV patients. Monkeypox lesions are firm, deep-seated, well-circumscribed with a central point of umbilication; present at a single stage of development on any one site of the body (e.g. all pustules on the arm); and evolve slowly with each stage, lasting 1–2 days. Varicella zoster virus lesions are usually more superficial in appearance with irregular borders, can be present at multiple stages on any one site on the body, and rapidly evolve from macules to crusts within 24 hours. Varicella zoster virus infection results in lifelong latent infection of the dorsal root ganglia, and reactivation with a dermatomally distributed painful rash illness (zoster) is common, particularly in persons older than 60 years.

5.3 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure

Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.

Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use.

Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine.

It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine extended-release should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine extended-release, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately.

Case Presentation

A 58-year-old man is being evaluated for a 4-year history of a diffuse, intermittent, nonpruritic rash associated with intermittent arthralgia, myalgia, generalized lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over 8 months. The symptoms did not appear in a predictable pattern each day or week. The rash was not responsive to oral antihistamines. Laboratory tests over the 4 years showed persistent leukocytosis (range 13,000–20,200/μL[13.5–20.2×10⁹/L]) with neutrophilia (range 11.2–17.3×10³/μL [11.2–17.3 10⁹/L]), worsening anemia (hemoglobin concentrations of 13.2–11.0 g/dL [132–110 g/L]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (92 mm/h), C-reactive protein (154 mg/L), and ferritin (494 ng/mL [494 μg/L]), and monoclonal IgM-κ gammopathy. Workup for Lyme disease, hepatitis B and C, HIV, tuberculosis, and syphilis was negative. Antinuclear antibody, anti–double- and single-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB were negative, and complement levels were within normal limits. Bone marrow and excisional lymph node biopsies were unrevealing. Physical examination revealed erythematous wheals coalescing into plaques scattered symmetrically on the trunk and extremities (Fig 1). A punch biopsy of the left arm was performed (Fig 2).

### Systemic lupus erythematosus following meningococcal vaccination [^115Sy8Xc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE) affects multiple organs and involves complex immune dysfunction. Because vaccinations are inherently designed to stimulate the immune response, they have been linked with increased risk for flare of SLE and other autoimmune disorders, and their association with new-onset autoimmune disease has been postulated in several case reports. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the meningococcal vaccine precipitating SLE in a previously undiagnosed patient. We present a case of a previously healthy, 17 year old Asian female who presented to the ED with 14 days of fever and fatigue after administration of the meningococcal vaccine, as well as 5 days of facial rash. Initial labs showed pancytopenia, bandemia, proteinuria, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated d-dimer. Both the antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double stranded DNA were positive and cervical lymphadenopathy was present. This case highlights the importance of considering acute autoimmune reactions such as SLE in the differential diagnosis when assessing previously healthy patients presenting with systemic symptoms such as fever and rash in the setting of recent vaccination.

### Abstract… [^112DCCiR]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

12 although the incidence declined with age. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy is infection, which in children is typically an acute and self-limited viral infection. While most cases resolve quickly, some entities such as atypical mycobacteria, cat-scratch disease, toxoplasmosis, Kikuchi's lymphadenitis, sarcoidosis, and Kawasaki's syndrome can create persistent lymphadenopathy for many months, and may be confused with neoplasms. INGUINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY Inguinal lymphadenopathy is common, with nodes enlarged up to 1 to 2 cm in diameter in many healthy adults, particularly those who spend time barefoot outdoors. 19 Benign reactive lymphadenopathy and infection are the most common etiologies, and inguinal lymphadenopathy is of low suspicion for malignancy. Infrequently, Hodgkin's lymphomas first present in this area, 11, 17 as do non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

Penile and vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, the lymphomas, and melanoma also can occur with lymphadenopathy in this area. When the overlying skin is involved, testicular carcinoma may lead to inguinal lymphadenopathy, 20 which is present in 58 percent of patients diagnosed with penile or urethral carcinoma. 21 In neither case is it the typical presenting finding. NODAL CHARACTER AND SIZE Lymph nodes that are hard and painless have increased significance for malignant or granulomatous disease and typically merit further investigation. For example, the nodes of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma are firm, fixed, circumscribed, and rubbery. This is in contrast to viral infection, which typically produces hyperplastic nodes that are bilateral, mobile, nontender, and clearly demarcated. Painful or tender lymphadenopathy is non-specific but typically represents nodal inflammation from an infection.

In rare cases, painful or tender lymphadenopathy can result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a neoplastic node or from pressure on the nodal capsule caused by rapid tumor expansion. Lymphadenopathy is classically described as a node larger than 1 cm, although this varies by lymphatic region. Palpable supraclavicular, iliac, or popliteal nodes of any size and epitrochlear nodes larger than 5 mm are considered abnormal.

### Development of a reticular rash in a febrile woman: an unusual cutaneous presentation of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma [^115gLSaG]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

AITL is an uncommon systemic lymphoproliferative disorder that comprises 18% of all peripheral T-cell lymphomas, with a mean onset age of 65 years. Diagnosis is often preceded by allergic reaction, infection, or drug exposure with antibiotics being the most commonly associated drug. It is proposed that immunity toward the offending agent results in immune dysregulation and therefore disease. However, the exact origin is unknown.

In order of decreasing frequency, clinical features consist of generalized lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, and night sweats), hepatosplenomegaly, cutaneous involvement, pleural effusion, edema, and ascites. Cutaneous findings of AITL are nonspecific, although usually associated with pruritus, a symptom our patient endorsed. Most commonly, morbilliform eruptions are reported; however, purpura, urticaria, nodules, and petechiae have also been described. Because of these nonspecific findings, AITL poses a diagnostic challenge when presenting as a rash but should be considered when systemic symptoms suggest AITL.

Laboratory abnormalities associated with AITL include anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Although features can be subtle or variable, histopathology is particularly essential for diagnosis. The most common finding is a superficial perivascular infiltrate with or without atypical lymphocytes. Specimens also usually demonstrate increased vascularity. Classically, perivascular infiltrates of neoplastic T cells express CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, and occasionally CD8, as seen in our patient. Although skin biopsy specimens of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, such as mycosis fungoides, feature similar lymphoid infiltrates, systemic symptoms in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically manifest long after advanced skin involvement; in addition, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can reliably be diagnosed by TCR gene arrangement studies via polymerase chain reaction. If diagnosis is still unclear, stains for follicular T-helper cell markers (CD10, CXCL13, PD-1, BCL-6, and CD40-L) are more specific to AITL. Node biopsy specimen further confirms the diagnosis.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The general approach to lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward: it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. < 38°C), night sweats and unexplained weight loss are not differentiating. In contrast, high fever (i.e. > 38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whilst subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

Physical examination

Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of node drainage, even though some systemic diseases [e.g. certain lymphomas and unicentric Castleman disease (CD)] may present with localized lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic rheumatologic conditions. Of note, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy should raise particular attention, because they are frequent sites of tumour metastasis. The most important characteristics to evaluate during physical examination of enlarged lymph nodes are size, consistency, fixation and tenderness. 'Red flags' for malignancy are a diameter > 1cm (2 cm for inguinal lymph nodes), hard consistency, fixation to subcutaneous tissue and absence of tenderness, even though these characteristics can also be found in inflammatory non-neoplastic diseases such as CD and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

### Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy [^114NRAhP]. Pediatrics in Review (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical lymphadenopathy affects as many as 90% of children aged 4 to 8 years. With so many children presenting to doctors' offices and emergency departments, a systematic approach to diagnosis and evaluation must be considered. In the following review, we aim to provide the pediatric clinician with a general framework for an appropriate history and physical examination, while giving guidance on initial diagnostic laboratory testing, imaging, and potential need for biopsy. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in the pediatric population is reactivity to known and unknown viral agents. The second most common cause includes bacterial infections ranging from aerobic to anaerobic to mycobacterial infections. Malignancies are the most concerning cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. The explosion in the use of ultrasonography as a nonradiating imaging modality in the pediatric population has changed the diagnostic algorithm for many clinicians. We aim to provide some clarity on the utility and shortcomings of the imaging modalities available, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Acute HIV infection — definition and clinical features — Acute HIV infection occurs soon after transmission and is typically characterized by the lack of anti-HIV antibodies and the presence of viremia, which can be detected by an HIV RNA test or p24 antigen test. Recent HIV infection is considered the period of ≤ 6 months after infection during which anti-HIV antibodies become detectable. People with acute HIV infection may experience fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and other symptoms; however, illness is generally nonspecific, and people can be asymptomatic or experience relatively mild symptoms. Clinicians may fail to recognize acute HIV infection because its manifestations are similar to those of many other viral infections, such as COVID-19, influenza, and infectious mononucleosis.

Background

Signs and Symptoms: Classically, monkeypox occurs in three stages. After an incubation period of approximately 1–2 weeks, a prodrome, characterized by fever and lymphadenopathy occurs, which is followed by the onset of a deep-seated vesicular or pustular rash that often begins centrally and spreads to the limbs. Transmission of monkeypox can occur through direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids, through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or intimate physical contact, or through touching items, such as clothing or linens, that previously touched a patient's infectious rash or body fluids. § Patients are considered contagious until the scabs have crusted over and fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed underneath.

### IgM monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance: diagnosis and management [^114oXUQm]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Schnitzler syndrome

Schnitzler syndrome is a rare auto-inflammatory disorder characterized by an IgM monoclonal gammopathy and chronic recurrent urticarial rash. The Strasbourg criteria outline additional minor criteria of recurrent fever, abnormal bone remodeling with or without bone pain, neutrophilic dermal infiltrate, leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Around 300 cases have been reported to date. It is underdiagnosed and, despite its rarity, is important to identify as specific treatment can significantly improve quality of life.

Clinical characteristics

Of 281 cases in the largest case series, fever was present in 72%, anemia in 63%, arthralgia in 68%, bone pain in 55%, lymphadenopathy in 26%, and liver or spleen enlargement and neuropathy in less than 10%. In smaller series fatigue and weight loss were documented in up to around 50% of cases. The urticarial rash can cover any part of the body, but face, palm and sole involvement is infrequent, as is intense pruritis. Skin lesions typically resolve within hours. The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is long, at a median of 5 years and may be as long as 20 years.

The monoclonal gammopathy is almost always IgMk. Bone marrow involvement is minimal, being around 4% in one series, and a median M-protein concentration of 6 g/L has been documented. In the largest case series, 63% of the 281 bone marrow samples were reported as normal. The MYD88 L265P mutation was detected in the peripheral blood of 30% of 30 patients. The authors suggested that the presence of this mutation may correlate with the risk of WM, although the mutation detection rate may have been underestimated as the sensitivity of detecting peripheral blood B-cell clones may be hampered when the level of disease burden is low. The frequency of the MYD88 L265P mutation in bone marrow has not been studied. Chronic inflammation may lead to AA amyloidosis in 2% of cases of Schnitzler syndrome. At a median of 8 years, the rate of evolution to lymphoma is 20%, which is in line with progression in unselected cohorts of patients with IgM MGUS.

Schnitzler syndrome is associated with cytokine dysregulation. It bears close phenotypic resemblance to an inherited disorder, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, caused by gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene. This results in upregulation of interleukin (IL)-1b production and has informed therapeutic options in Schnitzler syndrome, by targeting IL-1b.

Acute and recent HIV infection — clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis: Health care providers should consider the possibility of acute HIV infection in symptomatic people and in asymptomatic people with a possible acute (within 2–6 weeks) exposure to HIV. Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings may include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, pharyngitis, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with someone who has HIV or is at risk of HIV infection, sharing needles, syringes, or equipment for drug preparation or injection, or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with bodily fluids that may carry HIV. The differential diagnosis may include COVID-19, EBV and non-EBV (e.g. CMV) infectious mononucleosis syndromes, influenza, viral hepatitis, streptococcal infection, or syphilis, and diagnosis of any STI should prompt HIV testing and consideration of acute HIV infection.

### Incomplete Kawasaki disease presenting primarily with cough: a case report and brief literature review [^115BMRAX]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The traditional diagnostic criteria for KD include fever lasting more than five days, along with at least four of the following five clinical features: oral mucosal changes, polymorphous rash, changes in the peripheral extremities, bilateral non-purulent conjunctival injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. According to the revised Japanese diagnostic guidelines for Kawasaki disease (6th edition), the requirement for a minimum duration of fever has been removed from the diagnostic criteria. CKD can be readily diagnosed when all characteristic clinical manifestations are present. However, IKD, characterized by partial or atypical presentation of symptoms, often poses diagnostic challenges. Many patients with IKD are misdiagnosed with conditions such as sepsis and consequently receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Delayed diagnosis and management can contribute to disease progression, significantly increasing the risk of coronary artery complications, including ischemic cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction. The incidence of IKD is rising, and early recognition and timely treatment are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing cardiovascular morbidity in affected children.

Data from a nationwide survey in Japan revealed that among the six classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease (KD), including fever, 71% of children with IKD exhibited four of these typical features, 23% had three, and only 6% presented with one or two. Fever, perianal flushing (with skin peeling), and membranous desquamation at the fingertips and toes during the convalescent phase were the most frequently observed manifestations in IKD patients. Previous studies have reported that rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctival injection may precede the classic mucocutaneous features of KD. However, it is rare for KD to initially present with cough as the primary symptom. In this case, we report a child with IKD whose initial manifestation was severe cough — a presentation even less commonly observed.

### Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: a systematic review [^111LbKAu]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the initial challenges clinicians were facing was differentiating patients with MIS-C versus Kawasaki disease (KD) or toxic shock syndrome (TSS). KD is a vasculitis that typically presents with high fever and acute mucocutaneous inflammation in children < 5 years of age. Although typically a self-limiting condition, some children may have severe complications including coronary artery aneurysms, myocardial dysfunction, and thrombotic events. KD can be stratified into classic or incomplete, depending on the number of clinical findings characteristic to the disease. Fever for 5 days with ≥ 4 of the following 5 principle features distinguishes classic KD: (i) conjunctival injection, (ii) rash, (iii) erythema and edema of the hands and feet, (iv) cervical lymphadenopathy, and (v) oral mucosal changes. The diagnosis of incomplete KD includes fever with 2–3 of the principal features. On the other hand, TSS is a potentially lethal disease derived from the release of bacterial toxins. It is depicted by fever, rash, shock, vomiting and diarrhea, and treated by hemodynamic stabilization and antibiotics. A recent publication by Whittaker et al. elegantly compared the age and laboratory findings in patients with MIS-C, KD, and TSS.

We sought to conduct a systematic review to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding pediatric patients diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, we compared features of MIS-C with children with COVID-19. We included patients with COVID-19 to reinforce to the healthcare community and public the differences in the clinical presentation, to highlight the degree of systemic inflammation in MIS-C, and to iterate the differences in treatment and outcome between the two diseases.

### Monkeypox virus genomic accordion strategies [^1117imfn]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The clinical presentation of mpox caused by MPXV clade I or subclade IIa includes fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and/or malaise, followed by a characteristic rash that progresses centrifugally from maculopapules via vesicles and pustules to crusts that may occur on the face, body, mucous membranes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. The clinical presentation of subclade IIb infection diverges from classical mpox by having a good prognosis, self-limiting but infectious skin lesions (typically emerging at and restricted to the genital, perineal/perianal, and/or peri-oral areas) before the development of fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise. Generalized disease usually manifests with a rash that has not been widely observed in the current outbreak. Human-to-human transmission is substantially higher in outbreaks associated with subclade IIb MPXV than those caused by clade I and subclade IIa –. The R₀ for MXPV IIb among men who have sex with men (MSM) is higher than 1. Transmission may be catalyzed by a decrease in protection associated with the VARV/smallpox vaccination campaign that ended in 1980. Furthermore, a change in transmission route may be the cause of the difference in clinical presentation and pathogenesis as was shown in animal models.

### Painful perianal rash in an HIV-positive individual [^1131GxKY]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Another study demonstrated 61 out of 528 patients with monkeypox infections presented with anorectal symptoms alone. The vast majority of these cases occurred in men-having-sex-with men, with the anogenital region being the predominant location of the rash. Similar to our patient who was HIV positive with an undetectable viral load, this Spanish study showed that 44% of their cases had mostly well-controlled HIV. Additionally, similar to the anogenital lesions of condyloma lata seen in syphilis, the perianal lesions of monkeypox can often be accompanied by macular eruption and lymphadenopathy, most commonly affecting inguinal lymph nodes. Given its close resemblance to other STIs, it is important to differentiate monkeypox from other infectious causes of perianal vesiculopustules/papules and ulcers, especially those associated with proctitis (Table I). At present monkeypox is not regarded as a true STI. Although there is evidence of isolation of the virus in seminal fluid, it is unclear whether this virus is capable of replication/transmission through this route.

Summary of infectious causes of perianal vesiculopustules/papules and ulcerative lesions

Anal pain and proctitis can be the earliest and only presenting feature of monkeypox infection, particularly in high-risk groups like HIV-positive individuals or men-having-sex-with men. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anorectal involvement due to monkeypox is one of the indications for offering antiviral treatment with tecovirimat or brincidofovir. Therefore, it is important to recognize the monkeypox-associated enanthem and have a low threshold for testing in male patients presenting with new-onset anorectal symptoms, even in the absence of other cutaneous findings.

### Management strategies for patients presenting with symptomatic lymphadenopathy and breast edema after recent COVID-19 vaccination [^114rtnns]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is a well-documented finding associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Varying guidelines have been published for the management of asymptomatic patients who have a history of recent vaccination and present with incidental lymphadenopathy at screening mammography. Some experts recommend follow-up imaging, and others suggest that clinical management, rather than repeat imaging or biopsy, is appropriate. Symptomatic patients with lymphadenopathy and/or additional abnormal imaging findings should be treated differently depending on risk factors and clinical scenarios. Although ipsilateral lymphadenopathy is well documented, ipsilateral breast edema after COVID-19 vaccination has been rarely reported. The combination of ipsilateral lymphadenopathy and diffuse breast edema after COVID-19 vaccination presents a clinical management challenge because edema can obscure underlying abnormalities at imaging. For symptomatic patients with lymphadenopathy and associated breast parenchymal abnormality, prompt action is appropriate, including diagnostic evaluation and consideration of tissue sampling. This approach may prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment of patients with malignancy masked by symptoms from the vaccination.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^114vt7LF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms — Acute Q fever in children is less likely to cause symptoms than in adults and may be milder, with symptomatic illness typically febrile and accompanied by headache, weakness, cough, and other nonspecific systemic symptoms; illness is frequently self-limited, though a relapsing febrile illness lasting for several months has been documented. Gastrointestinal symptoms are reported in 50%–80% of pediatric cases, and skin rash is more common than in adults with a prevalence as high as 50% among diagnosed children. Q fever pneumonia is usually moderate with mild cough; severe manifestations are rare but can include hepatitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalitis, meningitis, hemophagocytosis, lymphadenitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

### Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy [^114UJHXp]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview for evaluation and management of the pediatric patient with cervical lymphadenopathy. A thorough history and physical examination are crucial in developing a differential diagnosis for these patients. Although infectious causes of lymphadenopathy are more prevalent in the pediatric population compared with adults, neoplasms should also be considered. Judicious use of imaging studies, namely ultrasound, can provide valuable information for accurate diagnosis. Common and uncommon infectious causes of cervical lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Surgical intervention is occasionally necessary for diagnosis and treatment of infections, and rarely indicated for the possibility of malignancy. Indications for surgery are discussed.
