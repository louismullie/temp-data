## Question

foot drop imaging

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about foot drop imaging. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and when to suspect foot drop. Then, I should verify the role and limitations of electrodiagnostic testing. Next, I will consider the imaging hierarchy and when to escalate from ultrasound to MRI. After that, I need to check advanced MRI techniques like DTI and MR neurography. I will then examine how imaging integrates with EDX to localize lesions and guide management. Finally, I should review special scenarios, pitfalls, and synthesize a practical algorithm with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: foot drop is impaired dorsiflexion with a steppage gait and increased fall risk, and the most common cause is common peroneal neuropathy at the fibular head, but I need to keep L5 radiculopathy, sciatic neuropathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, and anterior horn cell disease on the differential, so I should not jump to conclusions before correlating with exam and EDX [^114E7ytq] [^111scusU].

> Wait, let me verify the role of EDX before imaging: nerve conduction studies and EMG remain central to localize the lesion, grade severity, and inform prognosis, but they do not visualize the nerve or compressive lesions, and a normal study does not exclude a conduction block or early injury, so I should not over-rely on EDX alone [^113fi6jM] [^117Dq1mQ].

> Next, I should review the imaging hierarchy. Ultrasound is my first-line modality because it is fast, dynamic, inexpensive, and can directly visualize the peroneal nerve, detect enlargement, T2 hyperintensity, and mass lesions like ganglion cysts or varicosities, with reported sensitivity and specificity ranges that are reasonably good though variable across studies, so I will start with ultrasound at the fibular head and follow the nerve proximally and distally as needed [^113fi6jM] [^113Uz8ze] [^114qY1Tw].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to MRI. If ultrasound is non-diagnostic, if I suspect proximal sciatic involvement, if there are red flags for mass or infiltrative disease, or if I need precise preoperative mapping, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast, can show nerve enlargement and T2 hyperintensity, denervation edema in target muscles, and compressive lesions including ganglia, tumors, or hardware, and it can depict patterns that help distinguish peroneal neuropathy from L5 radiculopathy, though observer variability for cross-sectional area and T2 signal can limit prognostic utility [^116DKda3] [^111scusU] [^112wDkxT].

> I will now examine advanced MRI techniques. MR neurography with high-resolution 3D sequences improves delineation of the nerve course and small compressive lesions, and diffusion tensor imaging is an emerging quantitative tool showing decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in peroneal neuropathy, correlating with severity in preliminary studies, but I need to acknowledge that cutoffs are not yet standardized and larger validation is needed before routine adoption [^115A15FH] [^113VCnTU] [^1135HQFD] [^113dCQaU].

> Let me think about integrating imaging with EDX for localization. Denervation edema on MRI in tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus supports peroneal neuropathy, whereas involvement of hip abductors favors L5 radiculopathy, and a simple bedside screen of hip abductor strength has high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing radiculopathy from peroneal neuropathy, so I should correlate imaging patterns with EMG distributions to avoid mislocalization [^116DKda3] [^112oUckp].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or severe? I should double-check for proximal causes like sciatic neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty, where MRI can differentiate focal compression from diffuse traction injury and guide timing of exploration, and I must remember rare but critical mimics like intraspinal hematoma or epidural cysts compressing roots that present with foot drop and require urgent MRI and neurosurgical input [^115bSYVt] [^115YGQNb] [^112fVP7h] [^113HudVg].

> I need to ensure I cover special populations. In children and adolescents, I should consider tethered cord, Chiari with syrinx, or benign nerve sheath tumors like perineurioma, and in patients with multiple hereditary exostoses, full-length imaging is prudent because compression can occur at multiple levels beyond the fibular head, so I should tailor the imaging field of view accordingly [^11453f2E] [^116Mh2sK] [^1168CvVe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging predicting recovery. I initially thought increased nerve size or T2 signal might track with worse outcomes, but prospective data show high observer variability and no consistent prognostic correlation for CSA or T2 hyperintensity, so I should avoid overinterpreting these features and instead integrate clinical severity, EDX, and etiology when counseling patients [^112wDkxT].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm. Start with clinical examination and EDX to localize and grade, obtain ultrasound of the peroneal nerve at the fibular head and along its course to identify entrapment or mass, escalate to MRI if ultrasound is non-diagnostic or if proximal disease is suspected, consider MR neurography or DTI in complex or recurrent cases, and use imaging to guide interventions such as cyst excision, neurolysis, or targeted rehabilitation, while remembering that a normal EDX does not exclude a surgically remediable conduction block [^113fi6jM] [^111scusU] [^117Dq1mQ].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways. Imaging complements but does not replace EDX, ultrasound is an efficient first-line tool, MRI provides comprehensive mapping and etiologic clues, advanced techniques like DTI are promising but not yet standard, and careful correlation of imaging denervation patterns with clinical and EMG findings is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and to optimize outcomes [^113fi6jM] [^116DKda3] [^113VCnTU].

Foot drop imaging should be guided by clinical localization and electrodiagnostics [^114E7ytq], with **ultrasound as the first-line modality** for suspected peroneal neuropathy because it is fast, dynamic, and cost-effective [^notfound]. MRI is the **gold standard** for complex or unclear cases, providing detailed nerve and soft-tissue assessment and identifying compressive lesions, denervation, or alternative etiologies [^116DKda3] [^111scusU]. CT is reserved for bony pathology or when MRI is contraindicated. Imaging is most informative when integrated with clinical and electrodiagnostic data [^116DKda3].

---

## Indications for imaging in foot drop

Imaging is indicated when the cause remains uncertain after clinical and electrodiagnostic evaluation or when **compressive lesions** are suspected. Key indications include:

- **Unclear etiology**: Persistent uncertainty after clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment [^116DKda3].
- **Suspected compression**: Suspected nerve entrapment or mass lesions (e.g. ganglion cysts, tumors) [^111scusU].
- **Trauma**: History of trauma or surgery suggesting structural injury [^115bSYVt].
- **Progressive or atypical**: Progressive or atypical presentations requiring detailed anatomical assessment [^notfound].

## Specific imaging findings and their clinical significance

### Ultrasound findings

- **Nerve enlargement**: Increased cross-sectional area of the common peroneal nerve at the fibular head [^notfound].
- **Compression**: Identification of ganglion cysts, varicosities, or other mass lesions causing nerve compression [^114qY1Tw].
- **Dynamic assessment**: Real-time evaluation of nerve movement and entrapment during joint motion [^115QpcBb].

---

### MRI findings

- **Nerve signal abnormalities**: Increased T2 signal intensity indicating edema or demyelination [^111scusU].
- **Nerve enlargement**: Focal or diffuse enlargement of the peroneal nerve [^112wDkxT].
- **Muscle denervation**: Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images in tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus, indicating denervation [^notfound].
- **Compressive lesions**: Identification of ganglion cysts, tumors, or other mass lesions causing nerve compression [^111scusU].
- **Alternative etiologies**: Detection of radiculopathy, plexopathy, or other central nervous system lesions [^114E7ytq].

---

## Limitations and challenges of imaging

- **Operator dependence**: Ultrasound accuracy depends on operator expertise [^notfound].
- **Limited sensitivity**: MRI may miss subtle or early nerve lesions [^113VCnTU].
- **False positives/negatives**: Imaging findings must be correlated with clinical and electrodiagnostic data to avoid misinterpretation [^116DKda3].
- **Cost and availability**: MRI and CT may not be readily available or affordable in all settings [^115nAoao].

---

## Integration of imaging with clinical and electrodiagnostic evaluation

Imaging is most effective when integrated with clinical examination and electrodiagnostic studies. Electrodiagnostics localize the lesion and assess severity, while imaging identifies structural causes and guides management. A multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, radiology, and orthopedics ensures **accurate diagnosis and optimal management** [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, beginning with ultrasound for suspected peroneal neuropathy and escalating to MRI for complex or unclear cases. Imaging is recommended for all patients with peroneal neuropathy to exclude compressive lesions, but routine MRI is not advised for all cases due to variability and limited prognostic value [^112wDkxT].

---

Foot drop imaging should be **tailored to clinical suspicion**, with ultrasound as the first-line modality for peroneal neuropathy and MRI reserved for complex or unclear cases. Integration with clinical and electrodiagnostic data is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.

### Bortezomib-induced neuropathy in multiple myeloma manifesting as foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy [^1141zVuf]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present the case of a man in his 50s with multiple myeloma who developed foot drop after receiving bortezomib-dexamethasone combination chemotherapy. Diagnostic evaluations, including haematological parameters, nerve conduction studies and imaging, were performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of neuropathy. He was managed conservatively with analgesics and vitamin supplements, and bortezomib was temporarily withheld. The neuropathy gradually improved, and bortezomib was successfully reintroduced without recurrence of foot drop. Bortezomib-induced foot drop is a rare complication of bortezomib-based therapy in patients with multiple myeloma. Early recognition and intervention are crucial to minimise impact on quality of life. This case report emphasises the safe reintroduction of bortezomib post-neuropathy resolution, emphasising the importance of early recognition and multidisciplinary management.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^116PLrdX]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, as it also emerges from a recent meta-analysis published by Llewellyn et al. MRI, WBCs and [18 F]FDG PET/CT have a similar high accuracy and there are no evidence-based data to definitively prefer one over the other imaging modalities. Based on available data, there is no longer a role for the three-phase bone scan, except in excluding an infection. In MRI cases with equivocal findings, either WBC imaging or [18 F]FDG PET/CT could be selected, depending on availability and local preferences.

2b: In total, 11 studies were included (8 retrospective studies and 3 prospective study) that at least partly evaluated the value of imaging modalities in the mid- and/or hind-foot. Some of these performed a sub-differentiation regarding the anatomic regional location of the OM.

Three retrospective studies have evaluated the role of MRI, three retrospective and one prospective study evaluated the WBC scan, two prospective studies compared MRI and [18 F]FDG PET/CT and two combined retrospective studies performed [18 F]FDG PET/CT, WBC scan and MRI, and WBC scan and MRI, respectively. The sensitivity for detection of OM in the mid- or hind- foot ranges from 40 to 100% for MRI, with a specificity ranging from 61% to 82%.

In a retrospective study specifically analysing different foot regions, [18 F]FDG PET/CT provided a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 73%; WBC scan was 71% sensitive and 85.7% specific and MRI resulted in 77% of specificity and only 40% of sensitivity in detecting mid-/hind- foot OM. Nevertheless, no significant differences between the three modalities according to different locations were observed. In general, studies of WBC scan on diagnosing OM in the diabetic foot reported a sensitivity in the mid-/hind-foot ranging from 71–93%, with a specificity of 71–99%.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^117JZWnL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Consensus on the choice of the most accurate imaging strategy in diabetic foot infective and non-infective complications is still lacking. This document provides evidence-based recommendations, aiming at defining which imaging modality should be preferred in different clinical settings.

Methods

This working group includes 8 nuclear medicine physicians appointed by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), 3 radiologists and 3 clinicians (one diabetologist, one podiatrist and one infectious diseases specialist) selected for their expertise in diabetic foot. The latter members formulated some clinical questions that are not completely covered by current guidelines. These questions were converted into statements and addressed through a systematic analysis of available literature by using the PICO (Population/Problem–Intervention/Indicator–Comparator–Outcome) strategy. Each consensus statement was scored for level of evidence and for recommendation grade, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) criteria.

Results

Nine clinical questions were formulated by clinicians and used to provide 7 evidence-based recommendations: (1) A patient with a positive probe-to-bone test, positive plain X-rays and elevated ESR should be treated for presumptive osteomyelitis (OM). (2) Advanced imaging with MRI and WBC scintigraphy, or [18 F]FDG PET/CT, should be considered when it is needed to better evaluate the location, extent or severity of the infection, in order to plan more tailored treatment. (3) In a patient with suspected OM, positive PTB test but negative plain X-rays, advanced imaging with MRI or WBC scintigraphy + SPECT/CT, or with [18 F]FDG PET/CT, is needed to accurately assess the extent of the infection. (4) There are no evidence-based data to definitively prefer one imaging modality over the others for detecting OM or STI in fore- mid- and hind-foot. MRI is generally the first advanced imaging modality to be performed. In case of equivocal results, radiolabelled WBC imaging or [18 F]FDG PET/CT should be used to detect OM or STI. (5) MRI is the method of choice for diagnosing or excluding Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy; [18 F]FDG PET/CT can be used as an alternative. (6) If assessing whether a patient with a Charcot foot has a superimposed infection, however, WBC scintigraphy may be more accurate than [18 F]FDG PET/CT in differentiating OM from Charcot arthropathy. (7) Whenever possible, microbiological or histological assessment should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. (8) Consider appealing to an additional imaging modality in a patient with persisting clinical suspicion of infection, but negative imaging.

Conclusion

These practical recommendations highlight, and should assist clinicians in understanding, the role of imaging in the diagnostic workup of diabetic foot complications.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^117FvdfE]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — diagnostic imaging: Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the evaluation of diabetic foot infections, and a representative case shows a deep foul-smelling necrotic heel ulcer present for more than 1 month. In the past, a technetium bone scan typically would be performed, but the imaging is nonspecific and many false positive results interpretative as osteomyelitis were seen. White blood cell tagged imaging with indium or technetium is a more reliable technique for detecting the presence of infection.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^117UcSud]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Imaging studies for the diabetic foot — Imaging studies should only be ordered to establish or confirm a suspected diagnosis and/or direct patient management, and plain radiographs should be the initial imaging study in diabetic patients with signs and symptoms of a diabetic foot disorder. Because acute osteomyelitis might not demonstrate osseous changes for up to 14 days, serial radiographs should be obtained when initial radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high. Technetium-99 methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99 MDP) bone scans are highly sensitive but lack specificity in the neuropathic foot; combining Tc-99 MDP and indium-111 increases the specificity of diagnosing osteomyelitis, with a 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity reported for the combined technique in diabetic infections. With Tc-99 HMPAO scans, imaging occurs 4 hours following administration versus 24 hours postadministration with indium scanning, and Tc-99 HMPAO scans cannot be combined with Tc-99 MDP scans because of similar labeling; the indium-111 scan is not typically positive in aseptic neuropathic arthropathy, although false-positive indium scans can occur.

Tailor's bunion — ancillary studies and diagnosis: Ancillary studies rarely are necessary to evaluate a tailor's bunion deformity, but when indicated they may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and technetium bone scan. Diagnosis is predominantly clinical, and radiographic findings may be very helpful in assessing the exact nature of the deformity and contributory structural pathology.

### HIV neuropathy-associated foot drop, a presenting sign of HIV infection, resolving after initiation of antiretroviral therapy: a clinical vignette [^116BoAyB]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most frequent complaints in patients with HIV. Many complex syndromes exist, with the etiology being secondary to the disease process itself, antiretroviral medication, or immune reconstitution. However, isolated mononeuropathy is rare. In this case, we present a previously healthy man who complained of several months of worsening right foot drop that did not improve with physical therapy or lifestyle interventions. He had begun to use an solid ankle-foot orthotic on this right lower limb to minimize tripping and prevent falls. He had no other neuromuscular involvement or constitutional complaints. Nerve conduction study of the right lower limb showed decreased peak amplitude, prolonged distal latency, and decreased conduction velocity of the deep peroneal nerve. Electromyography revealed abnormal insertional activity and absent motor unit action potentials in both the right tibialis anterior and right extensor digitorum brevis muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right lower limb was suggestive of acute/subacute denervation of the right tibialis anterior muscle. An extensive laboratory workup revealed active HIV infection with a significant viral load. Once the diagnosis was made, the patient was started on antiretroviral treatment. Six months later, his foot drop had entirely resolved, in association with significant improvements in viral load and CD4 count. He has since been ambulating without assistive devices and his HIV/AIDS disease process remains well controlled. This clinical vignette is the first, to our knowledge, to illustrate that an acute focal mononeuropathy causing foot drop and gait dysfunction in an otherwise healthy-appearing individual can be a heralding sign of HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, it also suggests that this functional deficit can be reversed with timely initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment in this patient have not only led to an uncomplicated AIDS disease course but also restored his ability to ambulate with complete independence and improved his quality of life.

### Assessment of hip abductor power in patients with foot drop: a simple and useful test to differentiate lumbar radiculopathy and peroneal neuropathy [^112oUckp]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective study on a diagnostic test.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of hip abductor power assessment in the differential diagnosis of foot drop due to lumbar radiculopathy and peroneal neuropathy.

Summary Of Background Data

Foot drop arises from various neuromuscular conditions. Differential diagnosis obvious in the typical case, however, is often inconclusive. There are few reports regarding the validity of hip abductor power in the differential diagnosis of foot drop.

Methods

Sixty-one consecutive patients who presented with tibialis anterior weakness Medical Research Council grade of less than 3 were included and underwent neurological examination including the assessment of hip abductor power. Patient demographics, mechanism and pattern of foot drop, neurological findings, and the diagnoses were recorded. Final diagnoses were established on the basis of clinical information, imaging studies, and electrophysiological study in limited cases. Validity and reliability of the hip abductor power assessment in the differential diagnosis of foot drop due to lumbar radiculopathy and peroneal neuropathy were evaluated.

Results

There were 44 men and 17 women, with a mean age of 46.8 years (19–77 yr). The final diagnosis was peroneal neuropathy in 28 patients, lumbosacral plexopathy in 9 patients, lumbar radiculopathy in 21 patients, and sciatic nerve disorder in 3 patients. Concomitant hip abductor weakness was found in 85.7% of lumbar radiculopathy and 3.6% of peroneal neuropathy. The sensitivity and specificity of hip abductor power in the differential diagnosis of foot drop due to the lumbar radiculopathy and peroneal neuropathy were 85.7% and 96.4%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 94.7% and 90%, respectively.

Conclusion

Assessment of hip abductor strength is a simple and useful method in the differential diagnosis of foot drop due to lumbar radiculopathy and peroneal neuropathy.

### Ganglion cyst at the proximal tibiofibular joint in a patient with painless foot drop [^115A15FH]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Entrapment neuropathies of the fibular nerve and its branches are often underdiagnosed due to the lack of reliable diagnosis using clinical examination and electrophysiologic evaluation. Most fibular nerve compressions may be classified into 2 broad categories: (a) mechanical causes, which occur at fibrous or fibro-osseous tunnels, and (b) dynamic causes related to nerve injury during specific limb positioning. Foot drop resulting from weakness of the dorsiflexor muscles of the foot is a relatively uncommon presentation and closely related to L5 neuropathy caused by a disc herniation. However, we herein describe a rare case of usually painless foot drop triggered by a cyst at the proximal tibiofibular joint compressing the deep fibular nerve. The presence of multilevel disc diseases made the diagnosis more difficult. Foot drop is highly troubling, and health care providers need to broaden their search for the imperative and overlapping causes especially in patients with painless drop foot, and the treatment is variable and should be directed at the specific cause. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including high-resolution and 3D MR neurography, allows detailed assessment of the course and anatomy of peripheral nerves, as well as accurate delineation of surrounding soft-tissue and osseous structures that may contribute to nerve entrapment. Knowledge of normal MRI anatomy of the nerves in the knee and leg is essential for the precise assessment of the presence of peripheral entrapment conditions that may produce painless or painful drop foot. In conclusion, we stress the importance of preoperative anatomic mapping of entrapment neuropathies to minimize neurological complications.

### Characterizing peroneal nerve injury clinicoradiological patterns with MRI in patients with sciatic neuropathy and foot drop after total hip replacement [^115bSYVt]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sciatic nerve injury following total hip arthroplasty (THA) predominantly affects the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve, often causing a foot drop. This can result from a focal etiology (hardware malposition, prominent screw, or postoperative hematoma) or nonfocal/traction injury. The objective of this study was to compare the clinicoradiological features and define the extent of nerve injury resulting from these two distinct mechanisms.

Methods

Patients who developed a postoperative foot drop within 1 year after primary or revision THA with a confirmed proximal sciatic neuropathy based on MRI or electrodiagnostic studies were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two cohorts: group 1 (focal injury), including patients with an identifiable focal structural etiology, and group 2 (nonfocal injury), including patients with a presumed traction injury. Patient demographics, clinical examinations, subsequent surgeries, electrodiagnostic study results, and MRI abnormalities were noted. The Student t-test was used to compare time to onset of foot drop and time to secondary surgery.

Results

Twenty-one patients, treated by one surgeon, met inclusion criteria (8 men and 13 women; 14 primary THAs and 7 revision THAs). Group 1 had a significantly longer time from THA to the onset of foot drop, with a mean of 2 months, compared with an immediate postoperative onset in group 2 (p = 0.02). Group 1 had a consistent pattern of localized focal nerve abnormality on imaging. In contrast, the majority of patients in group 2 (n = 11) had a long, continuous segment of abnormal size and signal intensity of the nerve, while the other 3 patients had a segment of less abnormal nerve in the midthigh on imaging. All patients with a long continuous lesion had Medical Research Council grade 0 dorsiflexion prior to secondary nerve surgeries compared with 1 of 3 patients with a more normal midsegment.

Conclusions

There are distinct clinicoradiological findings in patients with sciatic injuries resulting from a focal structural etiology versus a traction injury. While there are discrete localized changes in patients with a focal etiology, those with traction injuries demonstrate a diffuse zone of abnormality within the sciatic nerve. A proposed mechanism involves anatomical tether points of the nerve acting as points of origin and propagation for traction injuries, resulting in an immediate postoperative foot drop. In contrast, patients with a focal etiology have localized imaging findings but a highly variable time to the onset of foot drop.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^116SJmoJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infection imaging — osteomyelitis diagnostics notes that computed tomography (CT) scans may be indicated in the assessment of suspected bone and joint pathology not evident on plain radiographs, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually preferred over CT for the investigation of osteomyelitis. A meta-analysis found positron emission tomography (PET) scans to be the most accurate modality for diagnosing osteomyelitis, providing a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 91%, whereas when PET scanning was unavailable an indium-labeled leukocyte scan was an acceptable alternative with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 80% in the peripheral skeleton. Ultrasound has been shown to be superior to plain radiographs for detecting chronic osteomyelitis, providing sensitivity comparable to Tc-99 MDP bone scanning, and MRI is more accurate and is the imaging study of choice if radiographs are normal and clinical suspicion is high for bone or soft tissue infection.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^115j8MAP]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 7
40-year-old man who had a skiing accident and sustained a high fibular fracture and syndesmotic injury. Soon after the injury, he presented with foot drop and symptoms of common peroneal nerve entrapment. CT at the level of the proximal fibula/calf shows periosteal new bone formation at site of the proximal fibular fracture (a). Sequential axial PDFS (b) and axial PD (c and d) sequences show the proximal superficial nerve (yellow arrows) and deep peroneal nerve (white arrows) shortly after the common peroneal nerve division. The deep peroneal nerve appears oedematous on the PDFS axial sequence. The superficial peroneal nerve appears oedematous, although to a lesser extent

Deep peroneal nerve

The deep peroneal nerve is a terminal branch of the common peroneal nerve arising from the bifurcation of the common peroneal nerve in the lateral compartment of the leg between the proximal part of the peroneus longus muscle and the neck of the fibula. The nerve then courses anteriorly deep to the extensor digitorum longus, and onto the surface of the interosseus membrane of the leg. The nerve then descends into the anterior compartment of the leg accompanied by the anterior tibial artery. Initially, the deep peroneal nerve passes lateral to the artery but distally becomes anterior. At the ankle joint, the deep peroneal nerve travels into the dorsum of the foot through the fibro-osseous anterior tarsal tunnel (formed by the inferior extensor retinaculum superficially, medial malleolus medially, lateral malleolus laterally and talonavicular joint capsule deeply), dividing within the dorsum of the foot into its two terminal branches, the lateral terminal branch and the medial terminal branch. The lateral terminal branch runs deep to the extensor digitorum brevis muscles as it passes the ankle joint. The medial terminal branch courses through the dorsal compartment of the foot, merging with the medial branch of the superficial fibular nerve at the first interosseous space.

### Diffusion tensor imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-centre study [^113dCQaU]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Objective

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed promising results in diagnosing upper limb neuropathies, but its value in patients with foot drop due to peroneal neuropathy has not yet been investigated. We aim to establish reference values for DTI metrics of the healthy peroneal nerve and to evaluate differences in DTI metrics between patients and healthy controls.

Methods

Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) from 22 pathological nerves, 14 asymptomatic patients' nerves and 65 healthy peroneal nerves were processed for quantitative assessment of fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity and mean diffusivity. Clinical baseline and follow-up data were prospectively collected for all patients.

Results

Mean patient FA values (0.40, SD 0.08) were significantly lower compared with healthy controls (mean FA 0.44, SD 0.06). Mean patient RD values (0.98 10–3 mm 2 /s, SD 0.21 10–3 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher compared with healthy controls (mean RD 0.85 10–3 mm 2 /s, SD 0.16 10–3 mm 2 /s). FA values were significantly lower in patients with severe foot drop (mean FA 0.40, SD 0.06) compared with non-severe foot drop (mean FA 0.48, SD 0.05).

Conclusion

Based on these results, DTI appears to aid in the differential diagnostic process of patients with peroneal neuropathy. Future studies should focus on automation of DWI processing, confirm the results in larger patient groups and try to establish reliable cut-off values for DTI metrics.

### Foot drop of sudden onset caused by acute hematoma in the lumbar ligamentum flavum: a case report and review of the literature [^112fVP7h]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report.

Objective

To describe an unusual case of acute hematoma in the lumbar ligamentum flavum causing foot drop.

Summary Of Background Data

There have been several reports of hematoma in the lumbar ligamentum flavum causing compression of the cauda equina and/or nerve root. However, the majority of these cases were chronic hematomas, based on clinical history and histologic findings.

Methods

A 64-year-old man presented with right foot drop of sudden onset and severe sciatica. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the 10th day after the onset of symptoms revealed spinal stenosis at L4/5 caused by a posterior mass that was isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, but was hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images 5 days later. Because of these neurologic findings, surgical exploration and excision of the intraspinal mass were performed on the 18th day after onset.

Results

Surgical treatment was uneventful, and the severe sciatica improved immediately after surgical treatment. Histologic examination revealed recent extravasation of blood in the degenerated ligamentum flavum. These findings were supported by the 2 consecutive preoperative MRI examinations. At 1 year after surgery, manual muscle testing of the tibialis anterior on the affected side had recovered to grade 4.

Conclusion

Consecutive MRI examinations performed 5 days apart in the early stage after the onset of symptoms clearly demonstrated intensity change, indicating acute hematoma of ligamentum flavum as a cause of foot drop of sudden onset.

### Painless foot drop: an atypical etiology of a common presentation [^115WVYFq]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Weakness of the dorsiflexor muscles of the foot is a relatively common presentation. In most cases, the etiology involves a peripheral injury to the common peroneal nerve. These patients usually present with lower motor neuron findings on evaluation. In contrast, if upper motor neuron findings were present a central lesion should be suspected and appropriate imaging studies are performed. We describe a patient with painless foot drop and lower motor findings on examination that was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This case demonstrates that multiple sclerosis can masquerade as a peripheral process in some patients.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^113Fn1gc]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Published reviews comparing the accuracy of using MRI, WBC scan and [18 F]FDG PET/CT in diagnosing OM in the mid- and hind-foot in diabetic persons are lacking. Lauri et al. reported on the value of these three imaging techniques in diagnosing diabetic foot OM. The performance characteristics were as follows: for [18 F]FDG PET/CT sensitivity 89%, specificity, 92%; for WBC scan with 111 In-oxine and 99m Tc-HMPAO, sensitivity 92% and 91%, respectively, and specificity 75% and 92%, respectively; for MRI, sensitivity 93%, specificity 75%. Although this systematic review and meta-analysis did not examine the diagnostic performance of the three imaging modalities according to the different foot location, both WBC scan and [18 F]FDG PET/CT showed an overall high accuracy in detecting OM in any site.

Concluding, MRI is useful for detecting soft tissue abscesses and necrotic tissue, but might miss OM in these areas. Based on the available data, in cases with equivocal results on MRI, clinicians can select either WBC or PET/CT imaging. In very complicated cases, e.g. in post-traumatic or post-operative phases, in which both MRI and [18 F]FDG PET/CT may fail due to their limited specificity in differentiating infection from sterile inflammation, or in the presence of lower limb ischemia, WBC SPECT/CT imaging may be useful.

In summary, there are no evidence-based data to definitively determine the most accurate imaging modality to use in diabetic patients with suspected OM of the mid- and hind- foot and the choice should be based on the single clinical case.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic foot infection, more specifically with respect to MRI, APMA/SVM/SVS 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI in patients requiring additional (more sensitive or specific) imaging, particularly if a soft tissue abscess is suspected or the diagnosis of osteomyelitis remains uncertain. Obtain MRI for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis if the probe-to-bone test is inconclusive or the plain radiography is not useful.

### Visualization of denervated muscle by gadolinium-enhanced MRI [^113eqjHb]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Thirty patients presenting with foot drop due to lesions of the peroneal nerve or L5 spinal root were investigated with gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI of the lower leg. Significant enhancement was only seen in the denervated muscles in a pattern appropriate for the distribution of the nerve or root. In a rat model, identical changes in the denervated muscle were reproduced and seen as early as 24 hours after sciatic nerve transection. Thus, Gd-enhanced MRI is a new and sensitive technique to visualize denervated muscle.

### Foot drop: where, why and what to do? [^114E7ytq]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Foot drop is a common and distressing problem that can lead to falls and injury. Although the most frequent cause is a (common) peroneal neuropathy at the neck of the fibula, other causes include anterior horn cell disease, lumbar plexopathies, L5 radiculopathy and partial sciatic neuropathy. And even when the nerve lesion is clearly at the fibular neck there are a variety of causes that may not be immediately obvious; habitual leg crossing may well be the most frequent cause and most patients improve when they stop this habit. A meticulous neurological evaluation goes a long way to ascertain the site of the lesion. Nerve conduction and electromyographic studies are useful adjuncts in localising the site of injury, establishing the degree of damage and predicting the degree of recovery. Imaging is important in establishing the cause of foot drop be it at the level of the spine, along the course of the sciatic nerve or in the popliteal fossa; ultrasonography, CT and MR imaging are all useful. For patients with a severe foot drop of any cause, an ankle foot orthosis is a helpful device that enables them to walk better and more safely.

### Bortezomib-induced neuropathy in multiple myeloma manifesting as foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy [^111vVKMd]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Learning points

Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) is a significant side effect of bortezomib-based treatment in multiple myeloma, and a high index of suspicion is required in patients presenting with weakness of extremities.
The inability to dorsiflex the foot is characteristic of foot drop and BiPN and should be confirmed by nerve conduction studies, which show absent nerve conduction.
Pre-existing diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities predispose to BiPN, and clinicians should closely monitor for BiPN in patients.
Bortezomib must be temporarily discontinued in patients with BiPN; reintroduction may be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks.

### Foot drop in head and neck cancer [^116E8vQj]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Common peroneal nerve (CPN) paresis or paralysis presents with weakness of the toe extensors as well as of the ankle dorsiflexors and evertors, causing foot drop and hypesthesia or paresthesia in the CPN distribution. Previous studies have shown associations with weight loss and leg crossing. Although CPN neuropathy has been described in cancer patients, it has not been described in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients specifically. Our objective was to describe a series of patients who developed CPN neuropathy during the course of their disease.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of the charts of patients with HNC and CPN neuropathy who were seen at our institution between 1995 and 2004 was performed.

Results

Four HNC patients with CPN neuropathy were identified. All had significant weight loss. One patient became symptomatic before treatment, 2 patients became symptomatic during treatment, and 1 patient developed foot drop 4 years after treatment when his free jejunal flap developed a stricture. Two patients had electrodiagnostic study findings that revealed conduction block at the fibular head and denervation of peroneal innervated muscles. Imaging studies revealed no evidence of metastatic disease in the lumbosacral region. All 4 patients improved after weight gain.

Conclusions

Common peroneal nerve neuropathy may be seen in HNC patients. The CPN may be susceptible in weight loss because of the associated loss of subcutaneous tissue, which cushions the nerve from the fibular head. Consideration should be given to prevention, appropriate neurologic consultation, and patient counseling.

### Entrapment neuropathy about the foot and ankle: an update [^116QZv2e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Occurrences of entrapment neuropathies of the lower extremity are relatively infrequent; therefore, these conditions may be underappreciated and difficult to diagnose. Understanding the anatomy of the peripheral nerves and their potential entrapment sites is essential. A detailed physical examination and judicious use of imaging modalities are also vital when establishing a diagnosis. Once an accurate diagnosis is obtained, treatment is aimed at reducing external pressure, minimizing inflammation, correcting any causative foot and ankle deformities, and ultimately releasing any constrictive tissues.

### How accurate is MRI for diagnosing tarsal coalitions? A retrospective diagnostic accuracy study [^116gtvV7]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Study design and patient selection

This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee (approval No. 2023–00491) and the need for written informed consent was waived. All procedures were conducted in compliance with the ethical standards set by the institutional and/or national research committee, as well as in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments, or other equivalent ethical standards.

The hospital's radiology information system was queried for all performed MRI examinations of the ankle and the term "coalition" between January 2013 and December 2022. The recorded diagnosis of TC was made by podiatric surgeons with the following clinical workflow: First, a detailed history of patients admitted for foot pain was conducted by the surgeon, which included inquiring about complaints of foot pain, duration of symptoms, and any relevant family history of foot problems. A physical examination of the affected foot was then performed, including assessment of range of motion, foot stability, and palpation for areas of tenderness or bony prominence. During the clinical evaluation, the surgeon also specifically examined common clinical signs of tarsal coalition, including rigid flatfoot deformity, limited or painful foot motion, and lack of foot positional flexibility. Next, imaging was performed to support the suspected clinical diagnosis. The first step was to obtain radiographs, including anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. After obtaining radiographs for initial imaging assessment, cross-sectional MRI was performed if radiographs were inconclusive. Patients were included in the study only if history, clinical examination, and imaging were consistent. In the next step, incomplete examinations (one or more missing sequences from the standard clinical protocol stored in the local Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS)) and patients with history of ankle or foot surgery were excluded. In order to evaluate the diagnostic performance, a control group undergoing MRI examinations of the ankle between January 2013 and December 2022 was included and matched by age, sex, and MRI field strength to the study group. Exclusion criteria of the control group included (1) evidence of TC on MRI or other imaging modalities in the local PACS, (2) clinical or surgical report diagnosing TC, (3) incomplete MRI examinations, and (4) history of ankle or foot surgery.

### Bortezomib-induced neuropathy in multiple myeloma manifesting as foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy [^116q7Qwp]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis consisted of lumbar radiculopathy, cerebrovascular accident and cerebellar ataxia. We ruled out lumbar radiculopathy because of the lack of typical symptoms, including pain, loss of sensation and associated tingling sensation. The patient also did not have any of the clinical symptoms associated with a cerebrovascular accident, including weakness down one side, sensation loss, difficulty speaking or understanding speech or personality changes. Except for the difficulty walking due to right-sided foot drop, there was no difficulty coordinating limb movements or unsteadiness to suggest cerebellar ataxia.

### Foot drop caused by single-level disc protrusion between T10 and L1 [^116WsEhy]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective investigation of surgical treatment of 25 patients with foot drop from single-level disc protrusion in the region of T10 to L1.

Objective

To describe cases of foot drop from single-level disc protrusion in the region of T10 to L1 and surgical outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Three cases of foot drop from T12-L1 disc protrusion are reported in the literature. Little is known, however, about foot drop resulting from single-level disc protrusion between T10 and L1 or its surgical outcomes.

Methods

Between January 1995 and October 2010, a total of 25 patients (mean age: 44 yr; range, 21–68 yr) presented to our department with single-level disc protrusion between T10 and L1 (6 at T10-T11, 7 at T11-T12, and 12 at T12-L1) with associated foot drop and without cervical or lumbar spinal stenosis or other neurological disease. The average follow-up period was 46.5 months. We treated all cases surgically with circumferential decompression with fixation. We assessed neurological status, tibialis anterior muscle strength, magnitude of local kyphosis, and cross-sectional area at the level of compression of the dural sac preoperatively and at the final follow-up.

Results

Preoperatively, all 25 patients exhibited both foot drop resulting from a lower motor neuron lesion and pathological reflexes resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion. Postoperatively, the mean calculated muscle strength recovery rate was 95%. Mean Japanese Orthopaedic Association score increased from 5.92 ± 1.22 points preoperatively to 9.56 ± 0.92 points at the final follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated that the cross-sectional area increased from 36.3 ± 7.3 mm2 preoperatively to 133.1 ± 6.1 mm2 postoperatively.

Conclusion

Foot drop can be caused by single-level disc protrusion between T10 and L1 and is usually associated with an upper motor neuron lesion. Pathological reflexes resulting from disc protrusion occurring between T10 and L1 differ depending on the level of the protrusion. Circumferential decompression with fixation may be an effective treatment option for this syndrome.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^115fkQ8v]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis Without Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)

Based on observational studies, we do not recommend the routine use of plain x-rays (because of inadequate sensitivity, specificity) or computed tomography scans (inadequate sensitivity) for all patients with a possible diagnosis of osteomyelitis (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2) as they may result in unnecessary radiation and use of resources. However, these studies may be helpful if a fracture or other noninfectious cause of bone pain (eg, tumor, foreign object) is prioritized on the differential diagnosis, and/or the pretest probability of osteomyelitis is lower (eg, ≤ 15%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging modalities for diagnosing osteomyelitis. Inflammatory biomarkers are insufficiently accurate, and we do not recommend their routine use for osteomyelitis diagnosis. Blood cultures have variable sensitivity, but if the patient has systemic symptoms or risk factors for bacteremia (eg, intravenous drug use), isolating likely pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) can be helpful to target with therapy and potentially obviate the need for bone biopsy. If available, bone biopsy for histopathology is highly accurate if positive, but cannot rule out osteomyelitis if negative. Culture of biopsy specimens of the affected bone may help identify etiology and target antimicrobial therapy.

Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis (DFO)

Based on observational studies, plain x-rays have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing DFO (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is simple, noninvasive, and has reasonable sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic method for DFO, which may preclude the need for imaging in some settings. MRI and certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging modalities for diagnosing DFO, although their specificities are lower than their sensitivities. Inflammatory biomarkers are insufficiently accurate and we do not recommend their routine use for diagnosis. If available, percutaneous bone biopsy for deep microbiological cultures may help target antimicrobial therapy; surface cultures are not accurate and not recommended.

### Perineurioma of the sciatic nerve: a possible cause of idiopathic foot drop in children: report of 4 cases [^116Mh2sK]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The authors report on a loss of foot dorsiflexion in pediatric-age individuals and suggest that the possible cause could be a perineurioma of the sciatic nerve. The authors describe 4 cases in which foot drop in the absence of sensory discomfort was the heralding sign of perineurioma of the sciatic nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a focal enlargement of the sciatic nerve, but the tumor was confined only to its lateral compartment. Treatment in 2 cases involved excision of the affected segment and subsequent graft repair. The two other patients shared the same clinical, radiological, and surgical findings, but no nerve biopsy sample was obtained; the patients underwent only a tibialis posterior muscle transfer. Long-term recovery of nerve function never occurred. Because tumor resection and nerve graft yield no functional results, a tendon transfer to restore walking may be the sole useful surgical procedure in these cases. Removal of the tumor may not be necessary because long-term follow-up confirms that perineuriomas are self-limiting and the final prognosis is favorable.

### MR imaging in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic foot drop [^116DKda3]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Prolonged T2 relaxation time of denervated muscle has been described in several clinical and experimental studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of MR imaging in the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle disorders compared with that of clinical and electrophysiologic examination.

Methods

In a prospective study, 40 consecutive patients clinically presenting with a foot drop were included. MR imaging of the lower leg included axial T1-weighted and axial turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequences. Two readers blinded to clinical data evaluated T1-weighted images for anatomic localization of affected muscles and TIRM images for patterns of signal intensity increase. After MR imaging, a detailed neurophysiologic examination was performed. Cause of foot drop was independently determined on the basis of MR and electrophysiologic data.

Results

Clinical examination and electromyography (EMG) disclosed 20 peroneal nerve lesions, nine cases of L5 radiculopathy, and 11 nerve lesions extending beyond neural structures. MR imaging revealed three distinct patterns of signal intensity increase on TIRM images: peroneal nerve pattern, L5 pattern, and unspecific pattern. MR imaging and EMG findings were in agreement in 37 (92%) of 40 patients. In three patients, MR imaging revealed a more widespread involvement than did EMG. In one of these patients, denervation in the corresponding muscle was validated by follow-up EMG. No false-negative diagnoses were made by use of MR imaging as compared with use of EMG.

Conclusion

MR imaging improves accuracy in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions compared with that of EMG and can supplement EMG in the diagnosis of denervated muscles.

### Diffusion tensor imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-centre study [^111BjKr4]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This proof-of-concept study reported DTI metrics of the peroneal nerve in both patients and healthy controls. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating DTI metrics of the peroneal nerve in patients with foot drop due to peroneal neuropathy.

In both ulnar neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, previous work indicated that diffusion is more isotropic in patients compared with healthy controls. This shows the potential for DTI in the detection of peripheral mononeuropathies. Based on our study results, FA and RD values of the peroneal nerve differ significantly between patients with foot drop due to peroneal neuropathy and healthy individuals. These results indicate a decrease in peroneal nerve integrity and myelin sheath damage in patients with foot drop due to peroneal neuropathy. Our results adhere closely to those of Griffiths et al, investigating differences in DTI metrics of the ulnar nerve between healthy volunteers and patients with cubital tunnel syndrome. Differences in FA and RD between patients and healthy controls were reported but not for MD and AD values. Differences in DTI metrics were not limited to the cubital tunnel alone but appeared throughout the length of the ulnar nerve as studied. As is the case in our study, these differences became apparent in a small study sample consisting of 13 patients and 14 healthy controls. Studies with larger patient samples are warranted to investigate differences in MD and AD values, since differences in MD values between patients and healthy controls were observed in other mononeuropathies like carpal tunnel syndrome. In patients with peroneal neuropathy, some oedema and swelling can be expected, potentially translating to higher MD values. In our study, FA values were significantly lower in patients with a severe foot drop compared with patients with a non-severe foot drop. These findings reflect a more severe loss of nerve integrity in patients with a more severe neurological deficit (foot drop). These findings are not unique to peroneal neuropathy. Cao et al showed a significant decrease in FA and AD values of the common peroneal nerve in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome compared with healthy volunteers. Bulut et al found differences in mean FA values of the median nerve between patients with mild, moderate and severe carpal tunnel syndrome. Overall, DTI findings in patients with peroneal neuropathy appear to correlate quite well with findings from other mononeuropathies. Future studies should aim at establishing cut-off values for DTI metrics to differentiate between a healthy and pathological peroneal nerve.

### Diffusion tensor imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-centre study [^1135HQFD]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Differences in DTI metrics between patients and healthy volunteers

DTI metrics for (a) symptomatic patient's nerves and healthy volunteers were reported in table 2. Mean values for FA, RD, AD and MD of the healthy volunteers taking age and BMI into account are available in the online supplemental table 3.

Table 2
DTI metrics for the peroneal nerve of patients (both asymptomatic and symptomatic nerve) and healthy volunteers

Significant differences in mean RD and FA values were observed between healthy controls and symptomatic nerves (table 3). In comparison to healthy controls RD was significantly higher and FA significantly lower in patients with foot drop due to peroneal neuropathy. The AUC for FA was 0.636 (p = 0.06). An FA value ≤ 0.43 had a sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 50.8% (Youden index 0.14). The AUC for RD was 0.666 (p = 0.02). An RD value ≥ 0.92 10 −3 mm 2 /s had a sensitivity of 68.2% and a specificity of 60.0% (Youden index 0.28). We observed no differences in DTI metrics when comparing pathological versus asymptomatic nerves in patients or when comparing asymptomatic patients' nerves versus healthy controls.

DTI and foot drop severity/foot drop recovery

14 patients had a severe foot drop at the time of imaging, 4 patients had a non-severe foot drop. The mean FA values of patients with a severe foot drop (0.40) were significantly lower (p = 0.04) compared with the mean FA values of patients with a non-severe foot drop (0.48). Mean values for RD, AD and MD were not significantly different between patients with a severe and non-severe foot drop (table 4A).

Table 4
Analysis of differences in DTI metrics between patients A with severe and non-severe foot drop and B who did and did not recover

Foot drop from 14 out of 17 patients included in the analysis recovered (82%). No significant differences in mean values for FA, RD, AD and MD were observed between patients who did and did not recover (table 4B).

### Early perioperative magnetic resonance findings in patients with foot drop following total hip arthroplasty: a descriptive case-series [^115YGQNb]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to characterize iatrogenic sciatic nerve injury patterns in the early, perioperative period following posterior-approach total hip arthroplasty (THA) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods

This was an IRB-approved retrospective analysis of patients acquired from a longitudinal, single site radiology database of patients who underwent MRI for "foot drop" within 4 weeks following posterior-approach THA surgery, over a 20-year period.

Results

MRI exams from 51 patients (mean age 62 years; 32 females) who met inclusion criteria were evaluated. Mean time to MRI was 2.4 days. Of 51 patients, 43 underwent primary THA, 6 revision THA and 2 explantation with antibiotic spacer placement. Ten exams revealed a normal appearance of the sciatic nerve. Nineteen showed compression of the sciatic nerve by edema or a fluid collection, without intrinsic nerve abnormality. Fifteen demonstrated perineural tethering or scar/granulation tissue encasement of the nerve, and in half of these cases the sciatic nerve was enlarged and/or hyperintense on fluid-sensitive sequences. Six patients had sciatic nerve compression secondary to quadratus femoris retraction. Six patients had complete resolution of the foot drop at a mean follow-up of 37.3 months following surgery, and in these cases the sciatic nerve appeared normal on the initial postoperative MRI. Remaining patients all had persistent weakness and paresthesias in the sciatic nerve distribution at a mean follow-up duration of 34.3 months.

Conclusion

This retrospective case series demonstrates various sciatic nerve injury patterns in the early perioperative period on MRI and proposes a targeted MRI protocol to evaluate the sciatic nerve post THA surgery.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^115nAoao]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infection imaging — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has generally supplanted computed tomography (CT) in the early diagnosis of osteomyelitis due to its higher tissue contrast and ability to detect both soft tissue and marrow inflammation. Additionally, MRI can be used to follow the resolution of infection or as an aid in surgical planning. However, none of these imaging modalities are 100% sensitive and specific for diagnosing or ruling out bone infection. Furthermore, these tests are expensive and may not be readily available, and appropriate clinical assessment and diagnostic acumen should therefore remain the guiding principles to management.

The patients visited a general practitioner at first in 84.7%, while 5.9% went to a neurologist. Additionally, 5.9% presented to an orthopedic, and 3.5% chose their gynecologist as their primary consultant.

Further referral to a specialist was generally based on the location of the mass (extremities, abdomen, and pelvis) or the leading symptom (neurological deficits, pain). Thus, referral to a general surgeon was made in 16.5%, while 21.2% were referred to an orthopedic based on their symptoms. Furthermore, 11.6% were transferred to a neurologist. An otolaryngologist was visited in 3.6%. However, the majority of 42.4% were transferred to a neurosurgeon (Table 2).

Overview of the involved medical society and the diagnostics

MRI magnetic resonance imaging, CT computed tomography

Diagnostic imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging as the primary diagnostic tool was performed in 96.4%. However, MRI was often initially focused on the spine, especially in cases of unclear radiating pain as primary symptom (31.7%). There was only one case where a CT scan was used as the initial diagnostic tool and one case where ultrasound was used at first (Table 2).

Misdiagnosis

An initial incorrect diagnosis was made in 44.7% of patients. In most of the cases, typical spinal disorders were suspected (34.2%), such as spinal canal stenosis or herniated disc of the cervical spine (46.2%) or the lumbar spine (53.8%). A sarcoma was suspected in 23.7%, while a nerve entrapment syndrome was wrongly diagnosed in 13.2% and a malignant lymph node in 10.5%. The other cases (18.4%) consisted of a shoulder-arm syndrome, a malignant peripheral nerve tumor, an idiopathic foot drop paresis, a dental root problem, and a hallux valgus (Table 3).

### Accessory ossicles of the foot-an imaging conundrum [^1126AkRk]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various anatomical variations can be found in the foot and ankle, including sesamoid bones and accessory ossicles. These are usually incidental findings and remain asymptomatic; however, they may cause complications resulting in painful syndromes or degenerative changes secondary to overuse or trauma. They can also lead to fractures or simulate fractures. These complications are challenging to diagnose on radiographs. Advanced imaging with US, CT, MRI, or Tc-99m bone scan is useful for definitive diagnosis. This study aims to illustrate how imaging modalities can be used to diagnose complications of common sesamoids and accessory ossicles of the ankle and foot (hallux sesamoids, os trigonum, accessory navicular, os supranaviculare, os peroneum, os intermetatarseum, and os calcaneus secundarius) and demonstrate the imaging differences between fractures and their mimics.

### Diffusion tensor imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-centre study [^113VCnTU]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Peroneal neuropathy is the most common mononeuropathy in the lower limbsand a well-known cause of foot drop and subsequent gait difficulties. Diagnosis is routinely made based on typical clinical findingsand confirmatory electrodiagnostics (EDX). This approach is limited by the absence of nerve visualisation and further lesion-type characterisation. Consequently, EDX is increasingly supplemented with MRIallowing for the detection of morphological abnormalities and further diagnostic finetuning based on increased cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements, increased T2 signal intensity and assessment of muscle denervation patterns. Previous researchrevealed important limitations of routine MRI of the peroneal nerve. CSA measurements and the assessment of T2 signal intensity were subjected to important intraobserver and interobserver variability and CSA cut-off values had a relatively low sensitivity and specificity. Routine MRI analysis is dependent on visual inspection of the image and therefore potentially subjective.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced, quantitative MRI technique, capable of measuring the direction and magnitude of diffusion in neural tissueand enables a more objective diagnostic approach compared with routine MRI. In physiological circumstances, diffusivity is the largest in the fibre direction and therefore highly anisotropic in peripheral nerves. Several parameters were defined to quantify diffusivity in peripheral nerves based on DTI. Among these measurements of diffusivity are fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD). The FA value reflects the degree of anisotropy and varies between 0 and 1 with 1 reflecting perfect anisotropic diffusion. FA is considered a general biomarker of nerve tissue integrity. A decrease might reflect tissue microstructure damage, demyelination or axonal loss.MD is a measurement of global diffusion. An increase in MD is compatible with swelling, oedema and inflammation.RD reflects diffusion orthogonal to fibre direction whereas AD measures diffusion in the fibre direction. A decrease in AD might reflect axonal neuropathy whereas an increase in RD might reflect myelin sheath damage.

### Chiari malformation type 1 presenting as unilateral progressive foot drop: a case report and review of literature [^11453f2E]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Foot drop is a disabling clinical condition with multiplicity of causes, which requires detailed evaluation to identify the exact aetiology. Here, we report an extremely rare cause of foot drop in a child, which if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old girl presented with difficulty in walking and left sided foot droop for1-month duration. On examination she had reduced muscle power in dorsiflexors and plantar flexors and diminished knee and absent ankle jerk in the left side. Sensory loss was noted in L4 and L5 dermatomes on the left side. Superficial abdominal reflex was absent on the left side while preserved in the right. Nerve conduction and electromyography revealed nerve root or spinal cord cause for the foot drop. These results prompted ordering MRI spine and brain which revealed Chiari malformation type-1 with holocord syrinx extending from the cervicomedullary junction to conus medullaris.

Conclusions

This case highlights the importance of considering broad differential diagnosis for foot drop and value of the complete neurological examination including superficial reflexes in arriving at a diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis helped to early neurosurgical referral and intervention which is an important prognostic factor.

### Low back pain and foot drop associated with dog tapeworm infection [^113HudVg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old woman presented with low back pain associated with radiation to left lower limb since the past 1 year, with left foot drop since the past 1 month. Examination revealed wasting of the left lower limb with a foot drop. The remaining neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed diffusely bulky and multi-septated homogenous fluid-filled lesions (with signal intensity similar to cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) in the intraspinal compartment from L3 to sacral vertebrae, causing extradural compression, and prevertebral and paravertebral locations (Figure 1). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed similar cysts in the retroperitoneum, liver, and left psoas muscle. Serum ELISA was positive for Echinococcus IgG antibody (value-19.31; normal < 9), thus confirming the diagnosis of disseminated hydatidosis.

Figure 1.
Sagittal T1-WI (A), sagittal (B and C) and coronal T2-WIs (D) show multiple well-defined cystic lesion in the intraspinal, preverebral, and presacral spaces (arrows in B and C) and in neural foramina (arrowsheads in C). Like the CSF, the lesions are hypointense on T1-WI (A) and hyperintense on T2-WI (B and C). Axial T2-WIs at L5 (E) and S1 levels (F) show intraspinal lesions (arrowheads in E) and lesions invoking the left psoas muscle (arrows in E and F).

Hydatid disease is a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus. Humans are intermediate hosts who become infected by accidental consumption of infected food/water, with liver and lungs being the commonest sites of involvement. Bone involvement is rare, occurring in less than 2% cases, with spinal involvement occurring in half of those cases. The thoracolumbar spine is the common site of involvement, with involvement of the sacral spine being very rare.ELISA serology has a sensitivity of 80–100% for hepatic infections but only 25–56% for other organ involvement.

In patients hailing from endemic regions and presenting with chronic low backache, with imaging suggestive of space-occupying lesions, hydatid disease should be considered in differential diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment lead to good clinical outcomes.

Common peroneal nerve

The common peroneal nerve arises from the sciatic nerve at the upper superior aspect of the popliteal fossa. It travels distally posteromedial to the short head of the biceps femoris and superficial to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The nerve then wraps around the fibular neck before entering the peroneal tunnel between the peroneus longus and the fibula, where it divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. It supplies the short head of biceps femoris, the lateral compartment of the leg via the superficial peroneal nerve and the anterior compartment of the leg via the deep peroneal nerve. In terms of sensory functions, it provides sensation to the anterolateral region of the leg and dorsum of the foot via the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. It also contributes to the lateral sural cutaneous nerve supplying sensation to the upper lateral leg and the sural nerve supplying the lower posterolateral leg.

Common peroneal neuropathy is the most common mononeuropathy of the lower limb. The two most common sites of entrapment are as it crosses the fibular neck, given its superficial location, and as it travels deep to the peroneus longus. There are many causes of entrapment, including direct compression from crush injury, extended lithotomy position during surgery, prolonged squatting, short-leg cast, ganglion cysts, synovial cysts, varicosities, tumours, hypertrophy of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle, traumatic injury following high fibula fracture (Fig. 7) and knee dislocation. Patients can present with the clinical symptoms of foot drop and a slapping gait. MRI findings include an increase in size and T2 hyperintensity of the nerve. MRI can also identify space-occupying lesions causing mass effect, and denervation oedema in the muscles supplied by the nerve. Treatment options depend on the cause, and include surgical treatment for an external compressing mass, activity modification, and consideration of local corticosteroid injections.

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and MR imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-center study [^112wDkxT]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in peroneal neuropathy are not well documented and the prognostic value of imaging remains uncertain. Upper limits of cross-sectional area (CSA) on ultrasound (US) have been established, but uncertainty regarding generalizability remains. We aimed to describe MRI findings of the peroneal nerve in patients and healthy controls and to compare these results to US findings and clinical characteristics.

Methods

We prospectively included patients with foot drop and electrodiagnostically confirmed peroneal neuropathy, and performed clinical follow-up, US and MRI of both peroneal nerves. We compared MRI findings to healthy controls. Two radiologists evaluated MRI features in an exploratory analysis after images were anonymized and randomized.

Results

Twenty-two patients and 38 healthy controls were included. Whereas significant increased MRI CSA values were documented in patients (mean CSA 20mm 2 vs. 13mm 2 in healthy controls), intra- and interobserver variability was substantial (variability of, respectively, 7 and 9mm 2 around the mean in 95% of repeated measurements). A pathological T2 hyperintense signal of the nerve was found in 52.6% of patients (50% interobserver agreement). Increased CSA measurements (MRI/US), pathological T2 hyperintensity of the nerve and muscle edema were not predictive for recovery.

Discussion

Imaging is recommended in all patients with peroneal neuropathy to exclude compressive intrinsic and extrinsic masses but we do not advise routine MRI for diagnosis or prediction of outcome in patients with peroneal neuropathy due to high observer variability. Further studies should aim at reducing MRI observer variability potentially by semi-automation.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^111aDoxh]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — imaging evaluation indicates that imaging studies are also important in the overall assessment of diabetic foot infections; plain film x-rays may indicate the presence of bony erosions and/or gas in the soft tissues, and the demonstration of osteomyelitis by plain radiographs lags the onset of bone involvement by 10 to 14 days. Bone scans such as Tc-99 may demonstrate abnormal uptake before changes are visible on radiographs, although this may be less specific in patients with peripheral neuropathy or with any preexisting osseous condition that causes increased bone turnover.

### The Charcot foot: a pictorial review [^115oXfJ9]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

MRI has a high diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing osteomyelitis of the foot, with a high sensitivity (77–100%) and a high specificity (80–100%). MRI has a very high negative predictive value (98%): if there are no signs of osteomyelitis on MRI, osteomyelitis can practically be excluded.

However, discriminating an active Charcot foot from acute osteomyelitis remains challenging. Both entities have similar image characteristics like bone marrow edema, soft tissue edema, joint effusions, fluid collections, and contrast enhancement in bone marrow and soft tissues. Even the degree of signal drop in T1 sequences might be quite similar in both conditions (Figs. 15 and 20). However, there are some imaging features (listed in Table 1, Fig. 21) that may help to find the correct diagnosis.

Table 1

Skin ulceration and sinus tract extending from the skin to the talar bone are present, showing a direct spread of infection (red arrow) (a). Diffuse bone marrow alteration is present within the talus. Note the disappearance of bony contours in the sagittal T1-weighted image (white arrows in b) and the reappearance of the bone structures after contrast administration (white arrows in c) demonstrating the "Ghost sign", which is described in many reviews as pathognomonic for osteomyelitis in Charcot foot. However, up to now, there is no study published evaluating the accuracy of this sign

Advanced MR-imaging techniques

Diffusion-weighted imaging may contribute in the detection and extension of osteomyelitis: pure edema does not show diffusion restriction, whereas the presence of pus and inflammatory cells in infection leads to restricted diffusion with lower ADC-values than in pure edema. Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)-perfusion may help in the discrimination between viable tissue and necrosis. Furthermore, the enhancement pattern in DCE-perfusion seems to be different between osteomyelitis and osteoarthropathic changes, increasing the potential of differencing lesions with bone marrow edema.

The common peroneal nerve is a major source of innervation to the lower limb, but it is sometimes compressed or entrapped at the fibular head. The authors present what they believe is the first reported case where peroneal nerve impingement caused by ganglion cyst compression of the nerve at the fibular head was diagnosed using a combination of ultrasound imaging and electrodiagnostic studies. The authors described the history, physical examination, electrodiagnostic findings, and musculoskeletal ultrasound findings of a patient with a left foot drop caused by a ganglion cyst compressing the common peroneal nerve at the fibular head. The increasing role of ultrasound imaging to evaluate musculoskeletal pathology is discussed.

### Lisfranc injury of the foot: a commonly missed diagnosis… [^115CpPeC]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility. Weight-bearing anteroposterior radiographs were then obtained. These films showed a 3-mm separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space. The patient was referred to an orthopedist. Treatment was open reduction and internal screw fixation, followed by a period of non–weight-bearing. Radiographs The initial radiographs of a suspected Lisfranc joint injury should include weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral views, as well as a 30-degree oblique view. 1, 4, 9, 12 A weight-bearing radiograph is necessary, because a non–weight-bearing view may not reveal the injury. As an example, Figure 6 is a non–weight-bearing radiograph of the foot shown in Figure 2. Note that the patient's foot appears to be normal in the non–weight-bearing view.

The diastasis between the base of the first and second metatarsals or the medial and middle cuneiforms should be evaluated carefully and compared with the unaffected side. On the radiographs, dislocation of the tarsometatarsal joint is indicated by the following: loss of in-line arrangement of the lateral margin of the first metatarsal base with the lateral edge of the medial cuneiform; loss of in-line arrangement of the medial margin of the second metatarsal base with the medial edge of the middle cuneiform in the weight-bearing anteroposterior view. 1 and the presence of small avulsed fragments, which are further indications of ligamentous injury and probable joint disruption 5. The lateral radiographic view of the foot may show a diagnostic "step-off, " which means that the dorsal surface of the proximal second metatarsal is higher than the dorsal surface of the middle cuneiform.

Some investigators 13 have suggested that radiographic displacement or flattening of the longitudinal arch of the foot is associated with a poor prognosis. This finding may also correlate well with the patient's functional result, even after treatment. 13 Other physicians caution that this radiographic abnormality pertains specifically to subtle injuries of the Lisfranc joint. 14.

Patients were older than healthy controls and more patients were male (see table 1).

Table 1
Participant demographics (patients and healthy volunteers)

18 patients had a severe foot drop. In total, 15 foot drops recovered within a period of 6 months (68.2%). All but two patients were treated conservatively. Two patients with severe foot drop underwent neurolysis of the peroneal nerve in a multicentre study comparing surgical and non-surgical treatment.

Footedness

Within the healthy peroneal nerve sample, significant differences in mean FA, RD, AD and MD were observed between the peroneal nerve of the dominant and non-dominant foot (see online supplemental table 2). Based on these findings, footedness was modelled as a binary covariate in further analysis.

### Peroneal nerve: normal anatomy and pathologic findings on routine MRI of the knee [^114bX6ns]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Intraneural ganglia

Intraneural ganglia are relatively rare compared to extraneural ganglia, but they should be considered in case of unexplained foot drop. Clinical and electromyographic findings are almost always more pronounced compared with extraneural ganglia, and this is related to the perineurium that restricts expansion of the intraneural ganglion and thus increases the pressure on the nerve.

The peroneal nerve is the most common location for intraneural ganglion cysts. An articular origin is becoming increasingly evident and has been demonstrated by delayed MR arthrography. The presence of the articular branch explains the high incidence of this condition at the peroneal nerve. This branch serves as a conduit for fluid, dissecting the epineurium between the fascicles. Intraneural ganglia follow the path of the least resistance and extend proximally in the deep peroneal nerve, the common peroneal nerve and sometimes even in the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve. Cases reporting bilateral occurrence in children and in both peroneal and tibial nerves have been described. Surgical intervention must also address the proximal tibiofibular joint to avoid recurrence.

### Diabetic foot ulcer imaging: an overview and future directions [^116XfYnD]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) affect one in every three people with diabetes. Imaging plays a vital role in objectively complementing the gold-standard visual yet subjective clinical assessments of DFUs during the wound treatment process. Herein, an overview of the various imaging techniques used to image DFUs is summarized. Conventional imaging modalities (e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emitted computed tomography, and ultrasound) are used to diagnose infections, impact on the bones, foot deformities, and blood flow in patients with DFUs. Transcutaneous oximetry is a gold standard to assess perfusion in DFU cases with vascular issues. For a wound to heal, an adequate oxygen supply is needed to facilitate reparative processes. Several optical imaging modalities can assess tissue oxygenation changes in and around the wounds apart from perfusion measurements. These include hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, laser Doppler flowmetry or imaging, and spatial frequency domain imaging. While perfusion measurements are dynamically monitored at point locations, tissue oxygenation measurements are static two-dimensional spatial maps. Recently, we developed a spatio-temporal NIR-based tissue oxygenation imaging approach to map for the extent of asynchrony in the oxygenation flow patterns in and around DFUs. Researchers also measure other parameters such as thermal maps, bacterial infections (from fluorescence maps), pH, collagen, and trans-epidermal water loss to assess DFUs. A future direction for DFU imaging would ideally be a low-cost, portable, multi-modal imaging platform that can provide a visual and physiological assessment of wounds for comprehensive wound care intervention and management.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^116ttpv4]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Metatarsalgia, characterized by forefoot pain, is frequent and is primarily due to foot static disorders. Initial evaluation with weight-bearing radiographs is essential, allowing precise analysis of the architecture of the foot. Ultrasound is useful for soft tissue and tendon examination and provides the best clinical correlation. Computed Tomography provides detailed bone assessment and is helpful for pre-operative planning. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is the gold standard modality, offering superior soft tissue contrast. The common causes of metatarsalgia include hallux pathologies (hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, and sesamoid issues), bursitis (intermetatarsal and subcapitellar), Morton's neuroma, second ray syndrome, stress fractures, and systemic pathologies affecting the foot. Combining clinical and imaging data is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management of metatarsalgia. Post-traumatic causes of metatarsalgia are beyond the scope of this article and will not be described.

Critical relevance statement

Metatarsalgia, the pain of the forefoot, necessitates accurate imaging for diagnosis and management. This review critically assesses imaging techniques and diagnostic approaches, aiming to enhance radiological practice and support effective therapeutic decision-making.

Key Points

Metatarsalgia commonly results from foot static disorders, requiring weight-bearing radiographs for assessment.
MRI is often the gold standard examination, but ultrasound is complementary, allowing for a radioclinical approach with dynamic examinations.
The radiologist is crucial in diagnosing metatarsalgia, providing essential imaging, and guiding treatment.

Question 3

IWGDF guidelines recommend to diagnose a STI in diabetic foot clinically, based on the presence of local or systemic inflammatory signs and symptoms, and to classify the severity of the infection according to the ulcer depth, the extent of spread of cellulitis from the ulcer, and the presence of systemic signs (inflammatory response). Whilst mild infections may be treated with oral (and perhaps topical) antimicrobial therapy, some moderate and all severe infections require urgent interventions, generally including intravenous antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement and patient stabilization. The decision to perform a surgical debridement is based on the clinical presentation, but sometimes it is not possible to estimate either the severity of the infection or the extent of tissue involvement. Therefore, we need to know the following:

3a: What kind of imaging modality is recommended in patients with an ulcer located at fore-/mid-foot complicated by a severe or moderate infection before performing a surgical debridement of the infected tissue?
3b: Which imaging modality is recommended if the infected ulcer is located in the hind-foot?

Reply to question 3

3a: Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to successful healing of diabetic foot ulcers, reducing the need for surgery. Although the diagnosis of STI is usually achievable by clinical examination, imaging may be sometimes useful to assess the extent of the process. Nevertheless, some imaging modalities may fail in differentiating between sterile inflammation and infection.

Plain X-rays are not optimal for detecting soft tissue abnormalities, but a recent retrospective study on 62 diabetic patients reported that the most frequent primary location of soft tissue emphysema, detectable with X-rays, was the forefoot (61.3%), followed by the mid-foot (21.0%) and hind-foot (16.1%). The soft tissue emphysema was most frequently observed in the dorsal foot tissue (49.2%), followed by both dorsal and plantar tissue (27.4%), and the plantar foot tissue (24.2%). X-rays findings showed a good correlation with CT findings, treatment outcome and microbiology.

### Knee intra-articular loose body causing a compression common peroneal nerve neuropathy with foot drop [^114f8qkK]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present a unique case of a man in his 60s with a knee intra-articular loose body causing a compression neuropathy on his common peroneal (fibular) nerve (CPN). This neuropathy caused a reduction in function of his leg's motor function causing a foot drop. Through a strong clinical interview and focused clinical examination, the neuropathy was localised, and the diagnosis was reinforced through nerve conduction studies and imaging. The intra-articular loose body was surgically excised after the careful isolation and decompression of the peroneal nerve. This resulted in a marked improvement in the patient's motor function and symptoms, allowing him to ambulate and return to normal function. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an intra-articular loose body in the knee causing a compression CPN neuropathy with symptoms such as foot drop. We hope this case report aids in guiding management should physicians come across this issue in the future.

### Common sports-related nerve injuries seen by the electrodiagnostic medical consultant [^115QpcBb]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

A variety of investigations are indicated in sports‐related neuropathies of the foot and ankle and should be chosen on a case‐by‐case basis. The authors consider ultrasound as an appropriate first‐line imaging modality for many foot and ankle presentations due to its high sensitivity, dynamic capabilities, and utility for the addition of point‐of‐care interventions. Diagnostic ultrasound is useful for superficial structures within the tarsal tunnel and has higher reported sensitivity than MRI for several foot and ankle pathologies. Normative values of tibial nerve CSA can be considered, although cut‐off pathologic values have not clearly been established. The authors caution against the strict use of tibial nerve CSA for diagnosis due to the variable branching pattern of the tibial nerve and the current lack of literature regarding its sensitivity and specificity. Instead, compared to the contralateral side and more proximal tibial nerve CSA may be more useful. Ultrasound can also be helpful for guiding near‐nerve sensory studies or performing diagnostic perineural local anesthetic blocks. In cases where ultrasound is non‐diagnostic, MRI may identify inflammatory or structural causes of nerve entrapment, in addition to demonstrating denervation edema. In the author's experience, patients may present with pain and sensory symptoms suggestive of TTS, with normal or inconclusive EDx testing and without imaging findings involving the tibial nerve. In these cases, neurogenic etiology is uncertain, and TTS is challenging to definitively diagnose.

### A rare cause of foot drop in a division 1 wrestler [^115BQKX8]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In this clinical vignette, we report the case of a 22-year-old Division I collegiate wrestler who presented with chronic left foot and ankle weakness, tightness, and a burning sensation extending from the mid-lateral calf to the dorsum of the foot. Initial MRI completed of the left knee one year prior to presentation was unremarkable. He was given a diagnosis of exertional compartment syndrome and he was medically cleared to compete. However, after sustaining an unrelated left knee injury during a match four weeks later, a repeat MRI revealed a multiloculated cystic lesion along the popliteal artery, consistent with adventitial cystic disease (ACD). The patient underwent surgical resection of the cyst and had worsening dorsiflexion weakness following the procedure. This was despite careful intraoperative preservation of the common peroneal nerve, suggesting the rare occurrence of intraarticular extension and possible nerve involvement. This case highlights the complex nature of ACD, drawing parallels to intraneural ganglion cysts. We detail the importance of early recognition through high-resolution imaging and EMG to assess for intraarticular and neural involvement preoperatively. Additionally, patient counseling should address the potential risk of foot drop as a complication of both ACD progression and surgical intervention.

### Complete foot drop with normal electrodiagnostic studies: sunderland "Zero" ischemic conduction block of the common peroneal nerve [^117Dq1mQ]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Common peroneal neuropathy is a peripheral neuropathy of multifactorial etiology often left undiagnosed until foot drop manifests and electrodiagnostic abnormalities are detected. However, reliance on such striking symptoms and electrodiagnostic findings for diagnosis stands in contrast to other commonly treated neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndrome. Poor recognition of common peroneal neuropathy without foot drop or the presence of foot drop with normal electrodiagnostic studies thus often results in delayed or no surgical treatment. Our cases document 2 patients presenting with complete foot drop who had immediate resolution after decompression. The first patient presented with normal electrodiagnostic studies representing an isolated Sunderland Zero nerve ischemia. The second patient presented with severe electrodiagnostic studies but also had an immediate improvement in their foot drop representing a Sunderland VI mixed nerve injury with a significant contribution from an ongoing Sunderland Zero ischemic conduction block. In support of recent case series, these patients demonstrate that common peroneal neuropathy can present across a broad diagnostic spectrum of sensory and motor symptoms, including with normal electrodiagnostic studies. Four clinical subtypes of common peroneal neuropathy are presented, and surgical decompression may thus be indicated for these patients that lack the more conventional symptoms of common peroneal neuropathy.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^113eXada]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

One study from 2003, compared 99m Tc-labelled monoclonal anti-granulocyte antibodies for diagnosing pedal OM to 111 In-WBCs in 25 diabetic patients with pedal ulcers (22 in the forefoot, 3 in the mid-foot). The operating characteristics for the two techniques for diagnosing pedal OM were comparable, with a sensitivity of 80 to 90% and specificity from 72 to 76%, respectively.

As previously mentioned, several reviews have described the value of imaging modalities for assessing various diabetic foot diseases. One, published in 2003, before the era of hybrid camera systems, found that for diagnosing OM (with no distinction between fore-, mid-, or hind-foot): radiography had a sensitivity of 28–93% and specificity 25–92%; three-phase bone scan had a sensitivity of 67–100% and specificity 18–83%; and WBC imaging had a sensitivity of 75–100% and specificity 54–89%. The use of [18 F]FDG PET/CT scanning was not included in this review. The other descriptive review, published in 2009, stated that WBC imaging is the NM procedure of choice for investigation of diabetic foot infections, with an overall accuracy of 80–85%. SPECT/CT will likely improve diagnostic accuracy even further, especially in the mid- and hind-foot. Bone scans were found to be of questionable value, and data on [18 F]FDG PET/CT were limited and inconclusive. Despite more recently published meta-analyses on [18 F]FDG PET/CT report wide range of accuracies, mainly depending on the type and number of the included studies, this modality emerges as useful and non-invasive tool for detecting DFO. Nevertheless, the development of standardized interpretation criteria is still needed to further improve its accuracy and for the harmonization of this diagnostic approach.

### Compression of root level in a patient with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging [^113igpiy]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by acute, painless, and recurrent mononeuropathies that are secondary to compression or minor trauma. This case is the first to report an intraspinal compression of the radicular nerve by schwannoma in a patient with HNPP. A 66-year-old woman developed left foot drop and paresthesia of the lateral aspects of left distal lower leg. An electromyography showed left L5 radiculopathy and severe peripheral polyneuropathy. A lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging revealed a radicular nerve in the intradural and extramedullary space being compressed by schwannoma. She previously had symptoms of foot drop several years ago, and HNPP was confirmed by peripheral myelin protein 22 deletion. She was surgically treated for L5 radiculopathy, which might have been caused by a traction of the nerve root by schwannoma at the intradural and extramedullary space. After surgical treatment, her symptoms of foot drop had improved from zero grade to IV+ grade within 4 weeks. The occurrence of HNPP and schwannoma in the same patient may be coincidental, but it is tempting to speculate that they share a common genetic basis. Therefore, for patients with HNPP, it is important to consider not only an electrophysiologic study but also a magnetic resonance imaging to locate the exact pathologic site.

### Diffusion tensor imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-centre study [^11428yfe]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics V.25. Demographic parameters were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (Shapiro-Wilk test showed no normal distribution for age and body mass index (BMI) only) and the χ² test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Analysis of differences in DTI measurements between the several types of nerves scanned (symptomatic nerve of patient, asymptomatic nerve of patient and healthy nerve of control) was done using linear mixed regression with random intercepts per patient. Age and BMI were modelled as covariates since they are known to explain some variability in DTI metrics. Additionally, footedness was modelled as a covariable. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the area under the curve (AUC) and optimal cut-off points to discriminate between a pathological and healthy peroneal nerve (in case significant differences for that DTI metric were observed). Differences in DTI metrics between patient groups with severe and non-severe foot drop and patients that did and did not recover were assessed using an analysis of covariance with age, BMI and footedness as covariates. Foot drop severity and recovery were coded as binary categorical variables. A severe foot drop was defined as an MRC score for ankle dorsiflexion ≤ 3/5. A non-severe foot drop was defined as an MRC score for ankle dorsiflexion of 4/5. Two patients with bilateral disease were excluded from the analysis. Recovery was defined as a clinically assessed normal MRC score for ankle dorsiflexion muscle strength or the absence of subjective loss of strength and gait difficulties (telephone interview). Four patients were excluded from the recovery analysis. Two patients who were treated surgically were excluded from this analysis to exclude variability introduced by different treatments. One patient who died very soon after diagnosis was excluded from this analysis. The fourth patient had bilateral disease and was excluded as well. All post hoc pairwise comparisons were corrected for multiple testing using the Holm-Bonferroni method. Correlation between FA and EDX parameters (% of the drop in CMAP, CMAP size proximal and distal to the fibular head and velocity decrement (m/s) were assessed with the Pearson R correlation coefficient in case of normally distributed data (FA, % of CMAP amplitude drop) and with Spearman's Rho in case of skewed data distribution (velocity decrement). Two patients with bilateral disease were excluded from the analysis since no data on velocity decrement or CMAP amplitude drop was available). Scatterplots were used to visualise the correlations.

### Evidence in peroneal nerve entrapment: a scoping review [^113fi6jM]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Daily management of patients with foot drop due to peroneal nerve entrapment varies between a purely conservative treatment and early surgery, with no high-quality evidence to guide current practice. Electrodiagnostic (EDX) prognostic features and the value of imaging in establishing and supplementing the diagnosis have not been clearly established.

Methods

We performed a literature search in the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Of the 42 unique articles meeting the eligibility criteria, 10 discussed diagnostic performance of imaging, 11 reported EDX limits for abnormal values and/or the value of EDX in prognostication, and 26 focused on treatment outcome.

Results

Studies report high sensitivity and specificity of both ultrasound (varying respectively from 47.1% to 91% and from 53% to 100%) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; varying respectively from 31% to 100% and from 73% to 100%). One comparative trial favoured ultrasound over MRI. Variable criteria for a conduction block (> 20%- ≥ 50) were reported. A motor conduction block and any baseline compound motor action potential response were identified as predictors of good outcome. Based predominantly on case series, the percentage of patients with good outcome ranged 0%-100% after conservative treatment and 40%-100% after neurolysis. No study compared both treatments.

Conclusions

Ultrasound and MRI have good accuracy, and introducing imaging in the standard diagnostic workup should be considered. Further research should focus on the role of EDX in prognostication. No recommendation on the optimal treatment strategy of peroneal nerve entrapment can be made, warranting future randomized controlled trials.

### Diffusion tensor imaging in peroneal neuropathy: a prospective, single-centre study [^111oTaoL]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed promising results in diagnosing upper limb neuropathies, but its value in patients with foot drop due to peroneal neuropathy has not yet been investigated. We aim to establish reference values for DTI metrics of the healthy peroneal nerve and to evaluate differences in DTI metrics between patients and healthy controls.

Methods

Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) from 22 pathological nerves, 14 asymptomatic patients' nerves and 65 healthy peroneal nerves were processed for quantitative assessment of fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity and mean diffusivity. Clinical baseline and follow-up data were prospectively collected for all patients.

Results

Mean patient FA values (0.40, SD 0.08) were significantly lower compared with healthy controls (mean FA 0.44, SD 0.06). Mean patient RD values (0.98 10 −3 mm 2 /s, SD 0.21 10 −3 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher compared with healthy controls (mean RD 0.85 10 −3 mm 2 /s, SD 0.16 10 −3 mm 2 /s). FA values were significantly lower in patients with severe foot drop (mean FA 0.40, SD 0.06) compared with non-severe foot drop (mean FA 0.48, SD 0.05).

Conclusion

Based on these results, DTI appears to aid in the differential diagnostic process of patients with peroneal neuropathy. Future studies should focus on automation of DWI processing, confirm the results in larger patient groups and try to establish reliable cut-off values for DTI metrics.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^116kbisY]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

In examining the published meta-analyses comparing different techniques for diagnosing OM, we found conflicting results. A 2008 meta-analysis by Dinh et al. included 9 studies and found that MRI emerged as the most accurate test for diagnosis of OM, with a pooled diagnostic odds ratio of 24, considerably higher than plain X-rays, bone scan or WBC imaging. Exposed bone or PTB had a high pooled diagnostic odds ratio, but this was based on only two studies. WBCs were radiolabelled with 111 In and performed with dated acquisition protocols, mainly without SPECT/CT, and interpretation criteria thus, possibly underestimating the accuracy of this modality. Conversely, in the 2006 meta-analysis by Capriotti et al. 99m Tc-WBC scan showed higher specificity and accuracy compared to MRI (respectively, 84.5% and 86% vs 74% and 80.5%). Similar conclusions emerged from a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Lauri et al. where the specificity for 99m Tc-WBC and [18 F]FDG PET/CT (92% for both) was higher than MRI and 111 In-WBC (both 75%), whereas all the techniques showed a similar sensitivity (approximately 93%).

Thus, based on the available meta-analyses, we are not able to offer a firm answer to this specific clinical question.

Of note, both IWGDF/IDSA guidelines and the Society for Vascular Surgery in collaboration with the American Podiatric Medical association and the Society for Vascular Medicine suggest using MRI for those patients who require a more sensitive or specific imaging study, or when the diagnosis of OM is uncertain with less advanced tests. If MRI is contraindicated or not available, WBC imaging, or in alternative [18 F]FDG PET/CT, should be performed.

More prospective well-designed studies are warranted to define which is the best technique or the best combination able to accurately diagnose an OM.

Question 2

IWGDF guidelines recommend performing an advanced imaging study, such as MRI, or [18 F]FDG PET/CT or WBC imaging, only in cases in which the diagnosis of OM remains doubtful after routine studies.

2a: Which imaging modality is more accurate in diabetic patients with suspected OM of the fore-mid-foot?
2b: Which modality is more accurate in cases of OM in the mid- or hind-foot?

### Clinching the cause: a review of foot drop secondary to lumbar degenerative diseases [^1173vifi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Foot drop is defined as weakness on dorsiflexion of the foot. The top two most common etiologies for foot drop include lumbar degenerative disease and common peroneal nerve injury. This review provides "updates" on understanding the lumbar etiologies of foot drop. Since the publication of "Preoperative motor strength and time to surgery are the most important predictors of improvement in foot drop due to degenerative lumbar disease" in the Journal of Neurological Sciences, three cohort studies have been published on spinal causes of foot drop. Classification, clinical features, diagnosis, and pathogenesis that may 'clinch' the cause of foot drop are discussed in the context of these recent publications.

### Peroneal nerve decompression in patients with multiple hereditary exostoses: indications, complications, and recurrence [^1168CvVe]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important to assess patients with MHE for multiple sites of compression and not just the proximal fibula. This includes the spine, ischium, proximal femur, distal femur, and proximal tibia. Sixty percent of cases in this series also had an osteochondroma removed from a location other than the proximal fibula, which might have compressed the nerve (Fig. 5). Full-length coronal and sagittal views of the lower extremities are routinely ordered prior to the surgical procedure. If the diagnosis is unclear, additional advanced imaging is warranted.

In this study, electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were not routinely obtained prior to decompression and excision. In a study by Cardelia et al. EMG and NCS were performed on all patients preoperatively. Interestingly, EMG and NCS revealed changes in the peroneal nerve in all of these patients, even though one-half of the patients had little or no neurologic deficit preoperatively. EMG and NCS are recommended if there is a question regarding the location of nerve compression or if quantitative findings are desired.

This study showed a 16% complication rate following peroneal nerve decompression and fibular osteochondroma excision. The most common complication was foot drop, which occurred after 7 operations (5.6%). Table VI lists foot drop rates from this current study and previous studies for comparison. Six of the 7 cases completely resolved, and the remaining foot drop improved to 4/5 muscle strength of the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus at 5 months postoperatively. All were managed with orthotics until the patient was able to actively dorsiflex. The potential reasons for injury were excessive perineural dissection or overzealous retraction and/or manipulation.

TABLE VI
Comparison of Rates of Iatrogenic Foot Drop Across Different Studies

The complication regression model was significantly different from the null model and fit the data well. The nomogram (Fig. 6) is useful for surgeons counseling patients who have had previous decompression (OR, 5.77) or require excision of an anterior proximal fibular osteochondroma (OR, 5.21). Reflecting the origins of the peroneus longus and extensor digitorum longus to mobilize the compartment and visualize and protect the nerve prior to osteochondroma excision may help to minimize this risk. The origins were repaired and protected with a CAM walking boot for 4 weeks.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^114HY85u]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination of the metatarsals should include palpation of the metatarsal base, shaft, and head, as well as examination of the proximal tarsometatarsal and distal metatarsophalangeal joints. Adjacent metatarsals should be examined, and neurovascular status should be assessed. IMAGING A standard foot series with anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views is sufficient to diagnose most metatarsal shaft fractures, although diagnostic accuracy depends on fracture subtlety and location. 7, 8 However, musculoskeletal ultrasonography can provide a quick bedside assessment without radiation exposure that accurately assesses overt and subtle nondisplaced fractures. Recent studies have demonstrated that musculoskeletal ultrasonography and traditional radiography have comparable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the diagnosis of foot and ankle fractures 9, 10.
14.

Foot radiography is required if there is pain in the midfoot zone and any of the following: bone tenderness at point C or D, or inability to bear weight immediately after the injury and at the time of examination. 14 When used properly, the Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules have a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 58%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 2. 4 and a negative likelihood ratio of
0. 02 for detecting fractures. These rules have been validated in adults and children. 16 If radiography is indicated, a standard foot series with anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views is sufficient to make the diagnosis. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Physical examination findings typically include tenderness to palpation, swelling, ecchymosis, and sometimes crepitation at the fracture site. The injured toe should be compared with the same toe on the other foot to detect rotational deformity, which can be done by comparing nail bed alignment.

Nail bed injury and neurovascular status should also be assessed. IMAGING Radiographic evaluation is dependent on the toe affected; a complete foot series is not always necessary unless the patient has diffuse pain and tenderness. There should be at least three images of the affected toe, including anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views, with visualization of the adjacent toes and of the joints above and below the suspected fracture location.

Material and methods

Ethics approval statement

Obtaining diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with peroneal neuropathy was a substudy within a larger imaging study involving both MRI and ultrasound.

Participant data

Patients with EDX-confirmed peroneal neuropathy and motor impairment for less than 6 months were recruited at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary, neuromuscular reference centre (University Hospitals Leuven). Recruitment started in the COVID-19 pandemic and occurred between March 2021 and February 2023. Patients were eligible if they had no history of recurrent foot drop, polyneuropathy, critical illness polyneuropathy, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies and had no surgical treatment prior to imaging. Trial participation was only considered in the absence of MRI contraindications. No exclusion based on aetiology occurred. Baseline data and clinical follow-up data were collected for all patients during standard-of-care follow-up. In case of incomplete motor recovery at the last clinical follow-up, patients were contacted by telephone to assess recovery. Recovery was defined as a clinically assessed normal Medical Research Council (MRC) score for ankle dorsiflexion muscle strength or the absence of subjective loss of strength and gait difficulties (telephone interview).

Healthy controls were recruited in the same period through advertisement and communications at the University Hospitals Leuven. Participants were considered healthy in the absence of a history of any neurological disease, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease or musculoskeletal disorders at the level of the knee.

Imaging protocol

MR acquisition was done using a 3.0 Tesla whole-body MRI scanner (Achieva dStream, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) and the dedicated dStream 16 channels knee receive coil. Patients were placed in a supine position, proximal fibular head positioned at the centre of the knee coil. Spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) diffusion MRI (dMRI) data for peripheral nerve imaging was obtained with 16 directions and b-value = 800 s/mm 2 in the axial plane using acquisition parameters as described in online supplemental table 1. The scanning protocol extended beyond the scope of this paper and included axial T1 weighted images, coronal and axial T2 weighted images with fat suppression and axial short τ inversion recovery sequences. Detailed technical specifications are available in the supplementary materials of previous work.

Future research agenda

From the analysis of current literature, several gaps emerged:

Head-to-head comparisons between different imaging modalities for diagnosing foot complications are lacking. The optimal way to define the best diagnostic strategy, as has recently been done for vascular graft infections, would be comparing the accuracy of WBC scintigraphy, [18 F]FDG PET/CT, and MRI in the same patient, using bone histology/microbiology as the gold standard.
Many included studies were published before the "era" of hybrid imaging, thus possibly underestimating the diagnostic performance of both PET and WBC imaging. The use of stand-alone PET, planar scintigraphic images or SPECT acquisition without CT co-registration also represents a major limitation when comparing the accuracy of different imaging modalities.
Standardization of acquisition protocols, as well as interpretation criteria, for all imaging modalities is warranted to reduce procedural heterogeneity and to allow optimal comparison amongst studies. This is particularly important for [18 F]FDG PET/CT. Specifically, it would be very useful to identify the most accurate strategies for image interpretation to differentiate OM from STI and CF. This would allow different centres to achieve harmonization in their methods.
It would be very useful to develop and attempt to validate and compare new specific protocols and sequences for MRI studies.
Studies are required to better explore the role of late acquisitions (e.g. after 90–120 minutes from [18 F]FDG injection) and dual-time-point PET/CT imaging for improving image quality and target/background ratios.
Further studies are needed to investigate the possible role of PET/MRI in imaging diabetic foot infections.
Further studies are needed to investigate the possible role of PET/MRI in imaging diabetic foot infections.
Studies are needed to determine the results of application of more specific radiopharmaceuticals for infection imaging and therapy monitoring.
Imaging is mostly employed for diagnosis, but is also important in the follow-up of patients with diabetic foot infections. Thus, data are needed from comparative longitudinal studies on the evolution of the infection. Particularly, investigating the possible impact of antibiotic therapy on NM imaging modalities would be helpful to better plan the diagnostic strategy.

Future research directed at filling these gaps would greatly increase the knowledge in this field and provide evidence that could be helpful in clinical practice for the management of specific clinical scenarios. Moreover, the availability, in each hospital, of a multi/inter-disciplinary team that jointly discuss difficult cases of diabetic foot complications has been shown to improve outcomes. Having specialists in radiology and NM play a role on these teams should help improve patient care.
