## Question

Is colecalciferol useful in preventing type 2 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colecalciferol (vitamin D3) is useful in preventing type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and whether benefits differ in prediabetes versus the general population. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine dose, formulation, and safety. After that, I need to check subgroup effects, especially baseline vitamin D status and BMI. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and translate this into a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and population of interest, because the answer hinges on who is being treated. The most consistent signal for benefit comes from adults with prediabetes, whereas trials in the general population have not shown a significant reduction in incident diabetes, so I need to keep that distinction front and center to avoid overgeneralization [^112wWTvn] [^111Rjn8t].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality randomized evidence. The D2d trial in 2,423 adults with prediabetes found that 4,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol did not significantly reduce incident diabetes versus placebo (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.04), but the point estimate favored vitamin D and the confidence interval included clinically meaningful benefit, so I should not jump to conclusions calling it negative [^112D3B5M] [^11746XSD]. Wait, let me verify the Tromsø study as well; it likewise showed a non-significant reduction with 20,000 IU/week (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69–1.18), again with a point estimate favoring vitamin D, reinforcing that individual trials were underpowered for modest effects [^115HRCdD].

> Hold on, I should verify the meta-analytic synthesis. An individual participant data meta-analysis of the three largest prediabetes trials (D2d, Tromsø, and DPVD) found a significant 15% reduction in diabetes risk with vitamin D (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% and increased regression to normoglycemia, which materially shifts the balance toward benefit in prediabetes [^112wWTvn] [^116DRZZd]. I should double-check aggregate meta-analyses as well; pooled RCTs in prediabetes show roughly a 10–13% relative risk reduction, consistent across several analyses, strengthening confidence in a modest but real effect [^115ZFtDp] [^116rVpKA].

> I need to check dose and formulation, because not all regimens are equivalent. The effective trials used moderate-to-high daily or weekly cholecalciferol doses (about 2,000–4,000 IU/day or 20,000 IU/week), and daily dosing is generally preferred over intermittent boluses for maintaining stable 25(OH)D levels and potentially optimizing glycemic effects, so I should emphasize daily dosing when advising patients [^115W6Wre] [^112YtL7L]. But wait, what if an active analog is used instead of cholecalciferol? The DPVD trial with eldecalcitol did not show a significant reduction in incident diabetes in the primary analysis, so I should avoid extrapolating benefits from cholecalciferol to active vitamin D analogs for diabetes prevention [^11389uuv].

> Next, I should review subgroup effects, especially baseline vitamin D status and BMI, because these may modify benefit. The clearest signal for a larger relative risk reduction occurs in participants with severe deficiency at baseline (for example, 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL), where D2d showed about a 62% reduction, although this was a subgroup and should be interpreted cautiously despite biological plausibility [^115648Jz] [^112p24G5]. Let me consider BMI as well; meta-analytic data suggest attenuated benefit with higher BMI, and some analyses show a dose–response pattern by BMI strata, so individuals without obesity may accrue relatively greater benefit, though the interaction is not always statistically significant and should be framed as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^115ZFtDp] [^111aiVyA].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability at the doses used. Across the prediabetes trials, serious adverse events did not increase with vitamin D, and rates of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones were low and not significantly different from placebo, supporting the safety of 2,000–4,000 IU/day in otherwise healthy adults with prediabetes when monitored appropriately [^112wWTvn] [^1145P8SQ]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with guidelines; the Endocrine Society notes that anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial at these doses in this population, which reassures me about routine use in prediabetes when accompanied by standard precautions [^114EynAu].

> Now, I will examine the general population data to ensure I am not overextending. In VITAL-T2D, 2,000 IU/day in older adults did not significantly reduce incident diabetes (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76–1.09), and a pooled analysis including VITAL and other community trials showed only a small, marginally significant reduction that is not sufficient to recommend routine supplementation for diabetes prevention in average-risk adults, so I should not generalize prediabetes findings to the general population [^111Rjn8t] [^111aiVyA]. I should also note that the USPSTF found no reduction in incident diabetes with vitamin D in pooled general-population trials, reinforcing that routine supplementation for diabetes prevention is not supported outside of high-risk groups like prediabetes [^112p24G5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The 2024 Endocrine Society guideline suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, based on moderate-certainty evidence that it lowers progression to diabetes, with the caveat that optimal dosing is uncertain and testing for 25(OH)D is not required before supplementation in this context [^115E97dE] [^112YtL7L]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence; the panel judged the desirable effects as moderate and undesirable effects as trivial, which supports a weak recommendation to offer vitamin D in prediabetes alongside lifestyle therapy [^114EynAu].

> Translating this into practice, I should confirm the following: target adults who meet ADA prediabetes criteria using fasting glucose, HbA1c, or 2-hour OGTT; use cholecalciferol rather than active analogs; prefer daily dosing in the 2,000–4,000 IU range; continue to prioritize intensive lifestyle modification and consider metformin when indicated; and monitor calcium and renal function if high-dose or long-term therapy is used or if risk factors for hypercalcemia exist, even though adverse events were uncommon in trials [^112YtL7L] [^115qBsYN]. I should double-check that I am not implying replacement of lifestyle or pharmacologic prevention; vitamin D is adjunctive and modest in effect, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^116wxPLo].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: yes, colecalciferol is useful for preventing type 2 diabetes, but the benefit is modest and concentrated in adults with prediabetes, with an approximate 10–15% relative risk reduction and a 3% absolute risk reduction over about 3 years, alongside increased regression to normoglycemia. Benefits appear greater in those with severe vitamin D deficiency and may be attenuated with obesity, and there is no convincing benefit for diabetes prevention in the general population, so routine supplementation should not be recommended for average-risk adults [^112wWTvn] [^115ZFtDp] [^111Rjn8t] [^1149Fjct].

Vitamin D3 (colecalciferol) **modestly reduces the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes** [^112wWTvn] in adults with prediabetes, with a 15% relative risk reduction and a 3.3% absolute risk reduction over 3 years [^112wWTvn]. The benefit is **greater in those with severe vitamin D deficiency** (< 12 ng/mL) [^115648Jz] and in non-obese individuals [^115ZFtDp], and is not observed in the general population [^111Rjn8t]. Vitamin D3 is safe at doses of 4,000 IU/day [^1145P8SQ] and is recommended by the Endocrine Society for high-risk prediabetes alongside lifestyle changes [^115E97dE] [^112YtL7L]. It is not a substitute for lifestyle interventions and has minimal impact on glycemic markers in the general population [^111Rjn8t].

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

Several large RCTs have evaluated vitamin D3 for diabetes prevention in prediabetes:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Intervention** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|-|
| D2d (2019) | 2,423 adults with prediabetes | 4,000 IU/day vs placebo | HR 0.88 (0.75–1.04); not significant [^112D3B5M] |
| Tromsø Study (2016) | 511 adults with prediabetes | 20,000 IU/week vs placebo | HR 0.90 (0.69–1.18); not significant [^115HRCdD] |
| DPVD (2022) | 1,256 adults with impaired glucose tolerance | Eldecalcitol 0.75 mcg/day vs placebo | HR 0.87 (0.67–1.17); not significant [^11389uuv] |

---

Although individual trials were not statistically significant, **meta-analyses show a modest benefit**. An individual participant data meta-analysis of the three largest trials (D2d, Tromsø, DPVD) found a **15% relative risk reduction** (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.96) and a **3.3% absolute risk reduction** over 3 years [^112wWTvn]. Another meta-analysis of nine RCTs found a **12% risk reduction** (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.99) in prediabetes [^115ZFtDp].

---

## Subgroup analyses and modifiers of effect

The benefit of vitamin D3 is **not uniform across all individuals**. Subgroup analyses indicate greater benefit in:

- **Severe vitamin D deficiency**: Baseline 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL showed a 62% risk reduction (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18–0.80) [^115648Jz].
- **Non-obese individuals**: Greater benefit in non-obese participants (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57–0.92) compared to obese (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84–1.08) [^115ZFtDp].
- **Consistently high 25(OH)D levels**: Maintaining ≥ 50 ng/mL during follow-up was associated with a 76% risk reduction (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.16–0.36) [^112wWTvn].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Vitamin D3 supplementation at doses up to 4,000 IU/day is **generally safe and well tolerated** [^1145P8SQ]. No significant increase in adverse events, including hypercalcemia, kidney stones, or gastrointestinal symptoms, was observed in clinical trials [^112wWTvn].

---

## Comparison with lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, weight loss) remain the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, achieving a **58% risk reduction** in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [^115qBsYN]. Vitamin D3 supplementation provides a modest additional benefit and is not a substitute for lifestyle changes [^116wxPLo].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

The Endocrine Society recommends vitamin D3 supplementation for **high-risk prediabetes** [^115E97dE], in addition to lifestyle modifications, citing moderate certainty of evidence for a modest reduction in diabetes risk [^112p24G5]. Routine vitamin D testing is not recommended; supplementation can be offered empirically [^116sT4h1].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **General population**: No significant benefit in the general population or those without prediabetes [^111Rjn8t].
- **Optimal dose**: Unclear optimal dose, duration, and formulation for maximal benefit [^111JmL5T].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Limited data on long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness [^115ZFtDp].

---

Vitamin D3 (colecalciferol) **modestly reduces the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes**, particularly in individuals with severe vitamin D deficiency and non-obese individuals. It is safe at recommended doses and can be considered as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions in high-risk prediabetes, but it is not effective for diabetes prevention in the general population.

Background

The role of vitamin D in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes remains unclear.

Purpose

To evaluate whether administration of vitamin D decreases risk for diabetes among people with prediabetes.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception through 9 December 2022.

Study Selection

Eligible trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test the effects of oral vitamin D versus placebo on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was time to event for new-onset diabetes. Secondary outcomes were regression to normal glucose regulation and adverse events. Prespecified analyses (both unadjusted and adjusted for key baseline variables) were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Data Synthesis

Three randomized trials were included, which tested cholecalciferol, 20 000 IU (500 mcg) weekly; cholecalciferol, 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily; or eldecalcitol, 0.75 mcg daily, versus matching placebos. Trials were at low risk of bias. Vitamin D reduced risk for diabetes by 15% (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96]) in adjusted analyses, with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (CI, 0.6% to 6.0%). The effect of vitamin D did not differ in prespecified subgroups. Among participants assigned to the vitamin D group who maintained an intratrial mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 ng/mL) compared with 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) during follow-up, cholecalciferol reduced risk for diabetes by 76% (hazard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.16 to 0.36]), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 18.1% (CI, 11.7% to 24.6%). Vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30% (rate ratio, 1.30 [CI, 1.16 to 1.46]). There was no evidence of difference in the rate ratios for adverse events (kidney stones: 1.17 [CI, 0.69 to 1.99]; hypercalcemia: 2.34 [CI, 0.83 to 6.66]; hypercalciuria: 1.65 [CI, 0.83 to 3.28]; death: 0.85 [CI, 0.31 to 2.36]).

Limitations

Studies of people with prediabetes do not apply to the general population. Trials may not have been powered for safety outcomes.

Conclusion

In adults with prediabetes, vitamin D was effective in decreasing risk for diabetes.

Were the treatment regimens appropriate?

Determining the appropriate formulation and dose of vitamin D and timing of administration (eg, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) in vitamin D trials can be challenging. The Tromsø study and D2d study administered vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), the most commonly consumed vitamin D formulation, and thereby increased the studies' translational potential. The DPVD study administered eldecalcitol, an analog of the active metabolite of vitamin D 3 that does not require activation in the liver and kidney. Although infrequent dosing (eg, monthly, yearly) of vitamin D is convenient, it produces fluctuating blood 25(OH)D levels and is considered nonphysiologic; therefore, daily or weekly dosing is preferred. The doses used (20 000 IU weekly [~2857 IU per day] in the Tromsø study, 0.75 mcg of eldecalcitol daily in the DPVD study, and 4000 IU daily in the D2d study) provide an appropriate balance of safety and efficacy in terms of obtaining an adequate difference in vitamin D status between the active and placebo groups.

All 3 trials appropriately compared vitamin D alone to placebo in a double-blind design. For practical and ethical reasons, all trials allowed participants to take outside-of-study vitamin D from all supplemental sources up to a certain amount and did not limit vitamin D intake from food sources. Many vitamin D trials have combined vitamin D with calcium or administered vitamin D in foods (eg, yogurt) and have used comparators other than placebo. Such study designs are not informative regarding the role of vitamin D alone for diabetes prevention because they cannot isolate the effect of vitamin D from other components of the intervention.

Was the primary outcome appropriate or accurately defined?

In all 3 trials, ascertainment for diabetes took place at regular intervals (every 3 or 6 months) by blood glucose testing using a single (central) laboratory and diabetes was appropriately defined based on strict, trial-specific glycemic criteria. Such an approach is robust and unbiased compared with other trials that relied on a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes outside of the study, which is influenced by many uncontrolled factors that contribute random noise, potentially shifting the risk difference between vitamin D and placebo towards the null.

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^114gfSPS]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The VITAL-T2D results and our meta-analysis with 3 additional high-dose cholecalciferol RCTs with long-term follow-up demonstrate that vitamin D is related to a 11% lower risk of T2D vs. placebo controls. Notably, although all the RCTs were consistently suggestive of a benefit with no heterogeneity between trials' effect estimates, none achieved statistical significance individually. A previous meta-analysis of RCTs among prediabetes patients reported a modest but statistically significant 3% reduction in absolute risk of T2D at 3 y of vitamin D supplementation (daily or weekly cholecalciferol or eldecalciferol formulations) vs. placebo. Most prior longer-term RCTs, however, exclusively enrolled patients with prediabetes and other higher-risk clinical populations, underscoring the previous gap in the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in the general population.

### Rationale and design of the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study: a diabetes prevention trial [^11451a9K]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Observational studies suggest that vitamin D may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, data from long-term trials are lacking. The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study is a randomized clinical trial designed to examine whether a causal relationship exists between vitamin D supplementation and the development of diabetes in people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

D2d was designed with support from a U34 planning grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The final protocol was approved by the D2d Research Group, the data and safety monitoring board, and NIDDK. Key eligibility criteria are age ≥ 30 years, BMI of 24 (22.5 for Asian Americans) to 42 kg/m(2), increased risk for diabetes (defined as meeting two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes established by the American Diabetes Association [fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL (5.5–6.9 mmol/L), 2-h postload glucose after 75-g glucose load 140–199 mg/dL (7.7–11.0 mmol/L), hemoglobin A₁c 5.7–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol)]), and no hyperparathyroidism, nephrolithiasis, or hypercalcemia. D2d participants are randomized to once-daily vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol 4,000 IU) or placebo and followed for an average of 3 years. The primary end point is time to incident diabetes as assessed by laboratory criteria during the study or by adjudication if diagnosed outside of D2d. Recruitment was initiated at the end of 2013.

Conclusions

D2d will test whether vitamin D supplementation is safe and effective at lowering the risk of progression to diabetes in people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^111Dxkqk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

### Effect of active vitamin D treatment on development of type 2 diabetes: DPVD randomised controlled trial in Japanese population [^11389uuv]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment with eldecalcitol, an active vitamin D analogue, at a dose of 0.75 µg per day did not significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes and failed to increase the rate of regression to normoglycaemia compared with placebo among patients with impaired glucose tolerance who were at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Although our study suggested the potential for a beneficial effect of active vitamin D treatment on the prevention of type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounding factors, this finding should be replicated in further populations before its significance for public health can be fully appreciated. Further research, such as an appropriately randomised study focused on pre-diabetic patients with insufficient basal insulin secretion or a meta-analysis including the results of this study, would be needed to determine whether vitamin D and/or active vitamin D is beneficial to people with pre-diabetes.

### Effect of active vitamin D treatment on development of type 2 diabetes: DPVD randomised controlled trial in Japanese population [^111Fsds1]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for various cardiovascular and renal diseases. The global prevalence of diabetes was 425 million adults in 2015, with an anticipated increase to 629 million by 2040. Moreover, a further 352 million people with impaired glucose tolerance are at high risk for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although lifestyle modifications may delay the development of type 2 diabetes, maintaining long term behavioural changes is difficult. Therefore, new strategies to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes are needed for people with impaired glucose tolerance.

Vitamin D receptors have been found in various cell types, including the pancreatic β cells, and active vitamin D is reportedly involved in insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Genetic studies in mice have shown that inter-organ communication and bone metabolism seem to be closely associated with insulin resistance. Observational studies have shown an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. Although several intervention studies and a recent meta-analysis have suggested that vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial effect on glycaemic control, relatively large scale clinical studies and other meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials have not supported this finding. Whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial only for children with vitamin D deficiency is unclear, as is which bone metabolism markers may be associated with the improvement in insulin resistance after treatment. Hence, we did a prospective trial, the Diabetes Prevention with active Vitamin D (DPVD) study, to assess whether 0.75 μg per day of eldecalcitol, an active vitamin D analogue, could reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among people with impaired glucose tolerance.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^11746XSD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study D2d was published by Anastassios G Pittas and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements. In the D2d study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency? In the D2d study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D2d study, the population was: 2423 patients (1086 female, 1337 male). The inclusion criteria were adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency. The key exclusion criteria were any glycemic criterion in the diabetes range affecting the glycated hemoglobin level; use of diabetes or weight-loss medications; use of supplements containing vitamin D at a dose > 1,000 IU/day or calcium at a dose > 600 mg/day. In the D2d study, the interventions were: n = 1211 vitamin D supplementation (at a dose of 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplementation) n = 1212 placebo (matching placebo). In the D2d study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of new-onset diabetes (9.39 events /100 py vs. 10.66 events /100 py; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.04). In the D2d study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypercalcemia, fasting urine calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.375, low eGFR, nephrolithiasis. In the D2d study, the conclusion was: in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of new-onset diabetes.

### The role of vitamin D and calcium in type 2 diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116yzpEi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Altered vitamin D and calcium homeostasis may play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION AND ANALYSES: MEDLINE review was conducted through January 2007 for observational studies and clinical trials in adults with outcomes related to glucose homeostasis. When data were available to combine, meta-analyses were performed, and summary odds ratios (OR) are presented.

Evidence Synthesis

Observational studies show a relatively consistent association between low vitamin D status, calcium or dairy intake, and prevalent type 2 DM or metabolic syndrome [OR (95% confidence interval): type 2 DM prevalence, 0.36 (0.16–0.80) among nonblacks for highest vs. lowest 25-hydroxyvitamin D; metabolic syndrome prevalence, 0.71 (0.57–0.89) for highest vs. lowest dairy intake]. There are also inverse associations with incident type 2 DM or metabolic syndrome [OR (95% confidence interval): type 2 DM incidence, 0.82 (0.72–0.93) for highest vs. lowest combined vitamin D and calcium intake; 0.86 (0.79–0.93) for highest vs. lowest dairy intake]. Evidence from trials with vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation suggests that combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation may have a role in the prevention of type 2 DM only in populations at high risk (i.e.g.lucose intolerance). The available evidence is limited because most observational studies are cross-sectional and did not adjust for important confounders, whereas intervention studies were short in duration, included few subjects, used a variety of formulations of vitamin D and calcium, or did post hoc analyses.

Conclusions

Vitamin D and calcium insufficiency may negatively influence glycemia, whereas combined supplementation with both nutrients may be beneficial in optimizing glucose metabolism.

### Vitamin D and health outcomes… [^117KX8za]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Not long ago, vitamin D was riding high. Beyond its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, animal studies linked vitamin D deficiency to numerous chronic illnesses including hypertension, diabetes, autoimmunity, and malignancy. 1 Corroborating human observational studies reported associations between vitamin D deficiency and increased risks of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and cancer. 2 The lay press seized on this chorus of observational studies, testing of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels proliferated, and supplementation with cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol increased substantially.

### Effects of vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk among people at risk of type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114SHNM1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is epidemiological evidence for an inverse association between circulating 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, an indicator of vitamin D status, and risk of type 2 diabetes; however, overall evidence from clinical trials does not support a causal association for diabetes incidence 1 or intermediate metabolic markers 2, 3, although some clinical trials have reported mixed findings 4, 5. Evidence for an inverse association between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes has also been accumulating 6, but trial evidence does not clearly support a causal effect for incident events or intermediate markers such as blood pressure, lipid levels, inflammation and arterial stiffness 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Taken together, the current evidence remains inconclusive, yet there is continued interest in the potential role of vitamin D in cardiometabolic risk protection. Concurrently, while many would consider vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) more effective than vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) in maintaining circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D 13, 14, there is a separate debate regarding bioavailability, with a higher proportion of 'free' (i.e. unbound) or bioavailable 25(OH)D 2 than free/bioavailable 25(OH)D 3 in response to an equivalent oral dose.

We conducted a trial to determine whether short‐term oral supplementation given monthly with vitamin D 2 or vitamin D 3 can lead to a reduction in glycaemia and an improvement in cardiometabolic factors in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We also examined the feasibility and safety of relatively high dose vitamin D supplementation among individuals we drew from the general population without prior knowledge of their circulating 25(OH)D concentrations.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^114kvSAv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes trial.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study was a 22-site trial that took place from October 2013 through December 2018 in the United States. The study randomly assigned 2423 adults (mean age 60 years, mean BMI 32 kg/m 2) who met at least 2 of 3 glycemic criteria for prediabetes (FG 100–125 mg/dL; 2hG 140–199 mg/dL; HbA1c 5.7–6.4%) to treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 daily or placebo. The primary outcome was time-to-incident diabetes based on annual glycemic testing through FG, HbA1c and 2hG, and semiannually with FG and HbA1c. The trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 28 ng/mL (69 nmol/L) and 78% of participants had a level ≥ 20 ng/mL (49 nmol/L) (Table 3). During follow-up, mean serum 25(OH)D level in the vitamin D group rose to 54 ng/mL compared with 29 ng/mL in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 616 diabetes events had occurred: 293 in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.4 events vs 10.7 events per 100 person-years, respectively). In the ITT analysis, the risk of diabetes was not significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI: 0.75–1.04).

In each of these 3 studies, protocol-specified adverse events of interest (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis) were rare, and there were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo.

Meta-analysis of RCTs

Our systematic literature review identified 3 RCTs meeting our eligibility criteria, including the Tromso Study, Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d), and Finnish Vitamin D

Trial (FIND) trials (Supplementary Fig. 1). The RCTs tested vitamin D3 for the primary prevention of major chronic disease, with T2D as a specified primary, or tertiaryoutcome. Briefly, Tromso enrolled 511 adults with prediabetes from 2007 to 2008 to test the effects of 20,000 IU/week of cholecalciferol over 5 years. Similarly, in D2d, 2423 adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity were randomized from 2013 to 2017 to compare the effects of 4000 IU/day of cholecalciferol vs. placebo, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years. FIND investigators randomized 2271 generally healthy older adults to placebo vs. 1600 IU/day vs. 3200 IU/day vitamin D3 for a median 4.2 years, for the primary prevention of CVD. The meta-analyzed estimate of VITAL with the other 3 RCTs indicated randomized vitamin D led to a 11% lower risk of T2D vs. placebo (pooled HR = 0.89 [0.80–0.99]; p = 0.035; I² = 0%) (Supplementary Fig. 2). D2d and FIND also reported results stratified by BMI, and when combined with the VITAL-T2D in our meta-analysis there was a suggested dose-response of lower T2D for vitamin D vs. placebo across BMI strata, with BMI < 25.0 kg/m 2 HR = 0.57 (0.32, 1.02), BMI 25.0–29.0 kg/m 2 HR = 0.80 (0.65, 0.97), and BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m 2 HR = 0.96 (0.83, 1.11); however, the statistical interaction by BMI category was not significant (p = 0.10).

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^111Rjn8t]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Observational and experimental evidence suggests that vitamin D plays a role in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, prior randomized supplementation trials are limited to high-risk patients with prediabetes. Here we aim to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of T2D in a general population of older US adults. The study design is an ancillary analysis (VITAL-T2D) of The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2×2 trial of daily vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol; 2000 IU/day) and omega-3 fatty acids (1g/day) for the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. We also conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of vitamin D trial (≥ 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol) vs. placebo and T2D risk. We analyzed 22,220 adults with mean age 67.2 years (SD = 7.1) without T2D at enrollment (2011 to 2014), randomized to vitamin D 3 or placebo. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.5kg/m 2 (SD = 5.3), with 51% female and 17% Black race/ethnicity. A subcohort (n = 911) attended in-person visits at baseline and 2 years for glycemic trait analyses. Our meta-analysis included 3 additional trials (5205 participants; 936 T2D cases). The primary outcome for the VITAL-T2D is intention-to-treat effect of vitamin D vs. placebo for incident T2D. T2D incidence (cases/1000py) at median follow-up of 5.3y was 3.98 for vitamin D and 4.37 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76, 1.09). Results did not differ by age, sex, BMI, or baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and vitamin D had no effect on glycemic traits at 2 years. Meta-analysis of 4 trials (n = 5205; 936 T2D cases) obtained HR = 0.89 (CI = 0.80, 0.99). In conclusion, Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce T2D in older US adults, but a modest reduction was observed when meta-analyzed with prior trials.

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^111gJsyt]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Pre-registered meta-analysis of RCTs

We additionally conducted a prospectively registered systematic literature search and meta-analysis of RCTs reporting effects of randomized moderate to high dose vitamin D vs. placebo on incident T2D risk (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42019147562). Briefly, our protocol and search strategy for PubMed, and Cochrane central register were developed to identify double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs published through December 4, 2024, reporting the effects of cholecalciferol vitamin D supplementation (≥ 1000 IU/day) vs. placebo on incident T2D risk in adults. We limited eligibility to interventions randomizing ≥ 100 participants and ≥ 2 years treatment duration (≥ 1000 IU/d). Abstract and full text screening, data extraction, and Jadad trial quality assessment were conducted independently by two investigators (DKT and EKD), and any conflicts were adjudicated by a third reviewer (ADP) as needed.

We meta-analyzed a pooled ITT HR and CI using a random effects model with Der Simonian-Laird inverse-variance weighting. We assessed between-study heterogeneity from the Mantel-Haenszel model and I 2 values with I 2 > 50% suggesting moderate heterogeneity. Where reported, we also meta-analyzed HRs and CIs stratified by baseline BMI, given prior meta-analyses have suggested a modifying effect of obesity

Meta-analyses were performed with STATA version 13 (StataCorp LP). All other analyses were conducted in SAS Software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical tests were 2-sided with alpha = 0.05 and no adjustment for multiple testing as planned.

### Baseline characteristics of the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study: a contemporary prediabetes cohort that will inform diabetes prevention efforts [^111CcEb6]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe baseline characteristics of the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study, the first large U.S. diabetes prevention clinical trial to apply current American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for prediabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This is a multicenter (n = 22 sites), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention clinical trial testing effects of oral daily 4,000 IU cholecalciferol (D 3) compared with placebo on incident diabetes in U.S. adults at risk for diabetes. Eligible participants were at risk for diabetes, defined as not meeting criteria for diabetes but meeting at least two 2010 ADA glycemic criteria for prediabetes: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100–125 mg/dL, 2-h postload glucose (2hPG) after a 75-g oral glucose load 140–199 mg/dL, and/or a hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) 5.7–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol).

Results

A total of 2,423 participants (45% of whom were women and 33% nonwhite) were randomized to cholecalciferol or placebo. Mean (SD) age was 59 (9.9) years and BMI 32 (4.5) kg/m 2. Thirty-five percent met all three prediabetes criteria, 49% met the FPG/HbA 1c criteria only, 9.5% met the 2hPG/FPG criteria only, and 6.3% met the 2hPG/HbA 1c criteria only. Black participants had the highest mean HbA 1c and lowest FPG concentration compared with white, Asian, and other races (P < 0.01); 2hPG concentration did not differ among racial groups. When compared with previous prediabetes cohorts, the D2d cohort had lower mean 2hPG concentration but similar HbA 1c and FPG concentrations.

Conclusions

D2d will establish whether vitamin D supplementation lowers risk of diabetes and will inform about the natural history of prediabetes per contemporary ADA criteria.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^1146YL3u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Experimental evidence (clinical trials)

There are 10 trials published between 2008 and 2019 that have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident diabetes (Table 2). Two large trials were designed and conducted for nondiabetes outcomes and reported data on incident diabetes in post hoc analyses. These 2 trials enrolled patients who were at average risk for diabetes (ie, not prediabetes), the intervention included low-dose vitamin D (400 and 800 IU daily) co-administered with calcium, and diabetes was ascertained by participants' self-report based on a diagnosis made outside of the study in routine clinical practice. Eight trials that have reported data on the effect of vitamin D supplementation and incident diabetes included persons with prediabetes. Five of these trials have major limitations, including a small sample size (109–205 participants), not being designed for incident diabetes as the primary outcome, a short duration (≤ 1 year), and open-label study design. Therefore, results from these 5 trials and the 2 large trials where incident diabetes was a post-hoc outcome are not informative in our understanding of the role of vitamin D supplementation for diabetes prevention in the clinical setting.

Table 2.
Trials That Have Reported on Vitamin D Supplementation and New-onset Diabetes

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials have been designed and conducted specifically to test the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes among persons with prediabetes. Below, we describe these most relevant trials in detail.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114EynAu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — vitamin D effects on glycemia and safety are as follows: Compared with placebo, vitamin D lowered fasting blood glucose and post–oral glucose tolerance test values, with mean difference −5.3 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −2.7] and mean difference −7.6 mg/dL [95% CI, −12.6 to −2.7], respectively, and there was a trend toward HbA1c lowering (mean difference −0.05% [95% CI, −0.10 to 0.01]). Meta-analyses found no clear differences for all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.26–2.18]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 fewer per 1000 [4 fewer to 6 more]) or cardiovascular disease events (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.33–3.57]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 more per 1000 [1 fewer to 31 more]). Nephrolithiasis showed no clear difference (RR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71–2.03]; estimated absolute effect size of 3 more per 1000 [5 fewer to 17 more]), there were no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia, and in the DPVD study there was 1 case of new-onset kidney disease in the vitamin D group and 2 cases in placebo (RR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05–5.51]). In D2d, adverse events were overall less frequent with vitamin D 4000 IU/day [100 μg/day] cholecalciferol versus placebo (IRR 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.98]). Based on these point estimates, the panel judged that anticipated desirable effects for diabetes prevention are likely moderate, while anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial.

### Effect of active vitamin D treatment on development of type 2 diabetes: DPVD randomised controlled trial in Japanese population [^113gZqsv]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess whether eldecalcitol, an active vitamin D analogue 2, can reduce the development of type 2 diabetes among adults with impaired glucose tolerance.

Design

Double blinded, multicentre, randomised, placebo controlled trial.

Setting

Three hospitals in Japan, between June 2013 and August 2019.

Participants

People aged 30 years and older who had impaired glucose tolerance defined by using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and glycated haemoglobin level.

Interventions

Participants were randomised to receive active vitamin D (eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day; n = 630) or matching placebo (n = 626) for three years.

Main Outcomes

The primary endpoint was incidence of diabetes. Prespecified secondary endpoints were regression to normoglycaemia and incidence of type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounding factors at baseline. In addition, bone densities and bone and glucose metabolism markers were assessed.

Results

Of the 1256 participants, 571 (45.5%) were women and 742 (59.1%) had a family history of type 2 diabetes. The mean age of participants was 61.3 years. The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at baseline was 20.9 ng/mL (52.2 nmol/L); 548 (43.6%) participants had concentrations below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). During a median follow-up of 2.9 years, 79 (12.5%) of 630 participants in the eldecalcitol group and 89 (14.2%) of 626 in the placebo group developed type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.17; P = 0.39). Regression to normoglycaemia was achieved in 145 (23.0%) of 630 participants in the eldecalcitol group and 126 (20.1%) of 626 in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.15, 0.93 to 1.41; P = 0.21). After adjustment for confounding factors by multivariable fractional polynomial Cox regression analysis, eldecalcitol significantly lowered the development of diabetes (hazard ratio 0.69, 0.51 to 0.95; P = 0.020). In addition, eldecalcitol showed its beneficial effect among the participants with the lower level of basal insulin secretion (hazard ratio 0.41, 0.23 to 0.71; P = 0.001). During follow-up, bone mineral densities of the lumbar spine and femoral neck and serum osteocalcin concentrations significantly increased with eldecalcitol compared with placebo (all P < 0.001). No significant difference in serious adverse events was observed.

Conclusions

Although treatment with eldecalcitol did not significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes among people with pre-diabetes, the results suggested the potential for a beneficial effect of eldecalcitol on people with insufficient insulin secretion.

### Vitamin D 20, 000 IU per week for five years does not prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes [^115HRCdD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with insulin resistance and risk of future diabetes.

Objective

The objective of the study was to test whether supplementation with vitamin D to subjects with prediabetes will prevent progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Design

This was a randomized controlled trial performed in 2008 through 2015.

Setting

The study was conducted at the clinical research unit at a teaching hospital.

Patients

Five hundred eleven subjects (mean age 62 y, 314 males) with prediabetes diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test as part of the Tromsø Study 2007–2008 were included. A total of 256 were randomized to vitamin D and 255 to placebo. Twenty-nine subjects in the vitamin D and 24 in the placebo group withdrew because of adverse events.

Interventions

Interventions included vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 20 000 IU/wk vs placebo for 5 years. Annual oral glucose tolerance tests were performed.

Main Outcome Measure

Progression to T2DM was the main outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were change in glucose levels, insulin resistance, serum lipids, and blood pressure.

Results

The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL). One hundred three in the vitamin D and 112 in the placebo group developed T2DM (hazard risk 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.69–1.18, Cox regression, P = 0.45, intention to treat analysis). No consistent significant effects on the other outcomes were seen. Subgroup analyses in subjects with low baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D yielded similar results. No serious side effects related to the intervention were recorded.

Conclusions

In subjects without vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Very large studies with inclusion of vitamin D-deficient subjects will probably be needed to show such a putative effect. This study tested if supplementation with vitamin D to subjects with prediabetes will prevent progression to type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Regarding preventative measures for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to primary prevention (vitamin D supplementation), ES 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering empiric vitamin D supplementation, in addition to lifestyle modifications, in adult patients with high-risk prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^115eEjGN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The main effect of vitamin D is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium. Severe vitamin D deficiency leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. However, due to the wide tissue distribution of the VDR and extrarenal activation of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2 D, it is believed that vitamin D has extraskeletal effects. Accordingly, low blood 25(OH)D levels have been associated with numerous diseases, including the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

The hypothesis that vitamin D status may influence the risk of type 2 diabetes is biologically plausible, because both impaired pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin resistance have been reported with low blood 25(OH)D levels. Importantly, critical tissues in the physiology of glucose homeostasis, such as the beta cell, express 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and can convert inactive vitamin D to its active metabolite. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency in mice leads to reduced insulin secretion that can be restored by vitamin D supplementation. Systemic inflammation is another component in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, and low blood 25(OH)D levels have been associated with high levels of inflammatory markers.

In humans, mechanistic studies show inconsistent results. Vitamin D supplementation for participants at high risk for or with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes has shown an effect as well as no effect on insulin sensitivity and secretion. However, such studies are inconclusive because they are underpowered; have included populations with sufficient vitamin D status, with a low risk for diabetes or with established diabetes; have co-administered vitamin D with other interventions, which may confound the effect of vitamin D; or have followed participants for short periods of time (about 2–6 months), which are likely inadequate to affect the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.

Despite basic research studies providing some support for mechanisms in favor of vitamin D having an effect on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, one needs to be careful of arguments in favor of biologic rationale, as the research history is filled with large trials that did not confirm a hypothesis that had a strong biological rationale from basic research.

Were the trial populations appropriate?

Selection of an appropriate trial population based on evidence from observational cohorts and mechanistic studies and good clinical judgment is essential. It has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation may be of benefit if started early in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. Despite its theoretical appeal, early supplementation presents multiple challenges. For example, diabetes progression is expected to be slow and vitamin D (or any intervention) is unlikely to have a detectable and clinically meaningful effect on diabetes risk if applied in people who are at an average risk for diabetes. Furthermore, because the rate of progression from normal glucose tolerance to diabetes is highly dependent upon specific population characteristics, calculating study size and length of follow-up needed for such a clinical trial is complicated. For these reasons, all 3 trials appropriately enrolled people with prediabetes who are most likely to benefit from interventions to lower risk of progression to diabetes. Notably, all trials defined prediabetes by specific glycemic criteria (FG, HbA1c, 2hG), expanding their translational potential.

For ethical and practical reasons, the trials did not include blood 25(OH)D level as an eligibility criterion and did not measure blood 25(OH)D levels in real time. Because of frequent testing for vitamin D status in routine clinical settings and the widespread use of over-the-counter vitamin D supplements, trial participants were mostly vitamin D replete by current vitamin D recommendations (blood 25[OH]D level ≥ 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L]) when the trials started and participants in the placebo group remained vitamin D replete during the follow-up.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

Evidence Synthesis and Next Steps

Given the highly consistent results from the existing longitudinal observational studies, it is unlikely that new observational studies would modify the conclusion that vitamin D status is inversely associated with diabetes risk. A search of clinicaltrials.gov did not identify ongoing or planned randomized controlled trials specifically designed and being conducted to test the effect of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Many large trials testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on nondiabetes outcomes in populations at average risk for diabetes have been recently published or will be completed soon. We expect many of these trials to present secondary results on incident diabetes; however, these reports will require careful interpretation due to several limitations (eg, enrolled population at low/average risk, inadequately defined diabetes outcome). Therefore, the conclusions we draw on the role of vitamin D for the prevention of type 2 diabetes will depend on data we already have.

We also expect many of the completed trials to publish secondary results on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. However, these trials are not powered for detecting an effect because the risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complications in these trial populations is very low.

Application of the Bradford Hill criteria to evaluate the totality of available evidence from longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials indicates a causal relation between vitamin D status and risk of type 2 diabetes. When combining data from the 3 large trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test vitamin D for diabetes prevention, Zhang et al reported a 12% reduction in diabetes risk with vitamin D supplementation (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78–0.99) among participants with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation may be more beneficial in adults with prediabetes and low vitamin D status, as suggested by the subgroup analysis in the D2d study that showed a 62% reduction (range 20–82%) in diabetes risk with vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo among participants with baseline serum 25(OH)D level < 12 ng/mL.

Abstract

Context

Over the last decade, vitamin D has emerged as a risk determinant for type 2 diabetes and vitamin D supplementation has been hypothesized as a potential intervention to lower diabetes risk. Recently, several trials have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes prevention in people with prediabetes.

Evidence Acquisition

A comprehensive literature review was performed using PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify: (1) recent meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies that report on the association between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level and incident diabetes, and (2) clinical trials of adults with prediabetes that have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident diabetes.

Evidence Synthesis

Longitudinal observational studies report highly consistent associations between higher blood 25(OH)D levels and a lower risk of incident diabetes in diverse populations, including populations with prediabetes. Trials in persons with prediabetes show risk reduction in incident diabetes with vitamin D supplementation. In the 3 large trials that were specifically designed and conducted for the prevention of diabetes, vitamin D supplementation, when compared with placebo, reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 13% in persons with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency.

Conclusions

Results from recent trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. Participant-level meta-analysis of the 3 largest trials should provide a more refined estimate of risk reduction and identify patient populations that are likely to benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation.

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^114Nx4Gf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has escalated in recent decades, now affecting nearly 10% of the global population. Although dietary factors, including excessive intake of refined grains and processed meats, weight gain, and lack of physical activity are major determinants of T2D, some nutrients such as vitamin D have been implicated in potentially reducing T2D risk. Geographical differences in sun exposure, as a proxy of between-population variability in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels, align with differences in T2D incidence rates. These observations are supported by several prospective cohort studies indicating individuals with incrementally lower serum vitamin D have higher insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and T2Dcompared with those who have adequate 25(OH)D levels. Experimental evidenceand short-term supplementation trials in humans, are mixed but suggest biologically plausible mechanisms of a causal role for vitamin D in reducing T2D, including improved β-cell function and insulin secretion.

Despite accumulating evidence relating vitamin D status or supplementation with T2D, findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are inconsistent. Potential explanations for discrepancies between RCTs and the epidemiologic evidence include the potential for bias in the observational literature from lifestyle correlates of vitamin D exposure, and limitations of previous RCTs in targeting the enrollment of only high-risk populations, having relatively short-term follow-up, and inability to stratify participants by their baseline serum 25(OH)D. Nonetheless, 3 recent placebo-controlled trials enrolling patients with pre-diabetes were suggestive of a benefit of 20,000 IU/week to 4000 IU/day of vitamin D 3 or 0.75 µg/day of eldecalcitol, a vitamin D analog –, and compelling subgroup findings support an emerging hypothesis of a differential response to vitamin D supplementation by baseline body weight (blunted response among those with higher body mass index [BMI]) that warrants further investigation –.

Challenges of vitamin D clinical trials

A clinical trial is often labeled as "positive" or "negative" based on whether the P -value for the statistical test for the primary outcome falls below or above (respectively) the traditional threshold of 0.05. This "dichotomania", which is based on an arbitrary threshold, provides clarity for regulatory agencies when deciding whether to approve a pharmaceutical agent for clinical use; however, it is overly simplistic when trying to determine whether an intervention has a real and clinically meaningful effect. When the primary outcome in a clinical trial "fails", there are several considerations that may clarify whether the intervention may still have clinical value. We modified a set of questions, described in the article by Pocock and Stone, for relevance to trials on vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes (Table 4). Below we address these questions in relation to the 3 major trials described above.

Table 4.
Questions to Address When the Primary Outcome "Fails" in Trials of Vitamin D Supplementation for Diabetes Prevention

Is there some indication of potential benefit?

When the primary outcome result is entirely neutral, concluding that the intervention has no effect is straightforward. Individually, each trial reported a result for the primary outcome of incident diabetes that did not reach the traditional 5% level of statistical significance; yet there is an indication of benefit from vitamin D, as all trials reported hazard ratios favoring the vitamin D treatment over placebo that were remarkably similar among the trials (0.87, 0.88, and 0.90).

Were the trials underpowered?

Each trial was powered to detect a 25% to 36% relative risk reduction in incident diabetes with vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo. Based on the results, vitamin D supplementation appears to decrease diabetes risk among people with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency by a smaller effect (~10–13%), but each trial was individually underpowered to test modest treatment effects. Of interest, in the Tromsø study and D2d study, the hypothesized relative risk reductions (30% and 25%, respectively) were within the reported 95% CI (0.69–1.18 and 0.75–1.04, respectively). Furthermore, as the size of the trial population increased, the reported 95% CI narrowed (Table 3). Therefore, it would be more appropriate to describe the findings of each individual trial as inconclusive rather than "negative".

### Clinical review: effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on improving glucose homeostasis and preventing diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114U791b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Observational studies report consistent associations between low vitamin D concentration and increased glycemia and risk of type 2 diabetes, but results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are mixed.

Objective

The objective of the study was to systematically review RCTs that report on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis or diabetes prevention.

Data Sources

Sources of data for the study were MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, and Science Citation Index from inception to June 2013.

Study Selection

Study selection was trials that compared vitamin D3 supplementation with placebo or a non-vitamin D supplement in adults with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers collected data and assessed trial quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random-effects models were used to estimate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios. The main outcomes of interest were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, hemoglobin A1c levels, fasting blood glucose, incident diabetes, and adverse events.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-five trials (43 407 patients) with variable risk of bias were included. Vitamin D had no significant effects on insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: MD -0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.30 to 0.22, I-squared statistic (I(2)) = 45%], insulin secretion (homeostasis model of β-cell function: MD 1.64; 95% CI -25.94 to 29.22, I(2) = 40%), or hemoglobin A1c (MD -0.05%; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.03, I(2) = 55%) compared with controls. Four RCTs reported on the progression to new diabetes and found no effect of vitamin D (odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10, I(2) = 0%). Adverse events were rare, and there was no evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

Evidence from available trials shows no effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on glucose homeostasis or diabetes prevention. Definitive conclusions may be limited in the context of the moderate degree of heterogeneity, variable risk of bias, and short-term follow-up duration of the available evidence to date.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^1125G2hs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

When evaluating the potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation, we should also not discount the benefit of the reversal of prediabetes to euglycemia. If vitamin D supplementation promotes regression to euglycemia, then more people will spend more time in the low-risk state away from prediabetes/diabetes. Therefore, the higher likelihood of reversal to euglycemia with vitamin D supplementation (~48% more likely, as stated by Zhang et al) may, by delaying time-to-onset of diabetes, represent an additional benefit to the 12% lower risk to progression to diabetes reported by the 2 meta-analyses of clinical trials.

Although the summary results reported by Zhang et al and Barbarawi et al are concordant, meta-analyses that combine aggregate data from trials that vary in study design and quality should be interpreted cautiously. Individual participant data meta-analyses that combine data from high-quality clinical trials specifically designed and conducted to test the hypothesis are necessary to (1) estimate with precision the benefit of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes progression and regression to euglycemia, (2) assess heterogeneity of the treatment effect in order to define prediabetes subpopulations most likely to benefit most likely to benefit from vitamin D supplementation, and (3) evaluate safety using time-to-event analyses.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^115648Jz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Do subgroup findings elicit positive signals?

Response to vitamin D depends on vitamin D status at baseline. Thus, people with higher baseline levels of blood 25(OH)D would benefit less from vitamin D supplementation than people with lower baseline levels. The high proportion of participants with adequate blood 25(OH)D levels at baseline may have prevented the detection of statistically significant differences between the vitamin D and placebo groups in the full trial cohorts. In all 3 trials, among participants with baseline blood 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL, the risk of diabetes with vitamin D supplementation was reported to be lower compared with participants with levels ≥ 20 ng/mL, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the D2d study, the risk of diabetes was significantly lower in a small subgroup of participants with a baseline 25(OH)D level < 12 ng/mL (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.80; p for interaction = 0.023). Results from subgroup analyses need to be interpreted cautiously partly because of the potential of a type I error (false positive) due to multiple analyses. However, given strong preexisting biologic plausibility, vitamin D supplementation may be more important in reducing diabetes risk among persons with prediabetes and low vitamin D status.

### Decreased serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol are associated with increased risk of progression to impaired fasting glucose and diabetes [^1163Lvsp]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, vitamin D concentrations are inversely associated with future incidence of IFG and diabetes. Hypovitaminosis D, especially at low levels (≤ 37.5 nmol/L) is an independent risk factor for diabetes, and increasing 25-OHD may partially minimize the risk of diabetes. Confirmation of these results in large-scale randomized, controlled trials will have important implications for diabetes prevention and public health, because vitamin D supplementation is easy to implement, inexpensive, and safe. Further studies are required to assess the link between 25-OHD and other metabolic anomalies that are common in diabetes (e.g. hyperlipidemia) and to determine the optimal vitamin D target in the general population and among those at risk for diabetes.

Temporal relationship, strength of association, and dose response

Evidence to support the prerequisites of the temporal relationship, strength of the association, and dose response (Table 1) comes from observational studies. Many cross-sectional studies have reported inverse associations between vitamin D status and glucose intolerance; however, cross-sectional studies are not informative and can only be considered hypothesis-generating, as the directionality of the association cannot be established.

Several observational, longitudinal studies conducted in diverse cohorts have reported consistent inverse associations between blood 25(OH)D levels and the risk of incident diabetes. Results have been summarized in recent meta-analyses with similar findings. Song et al combined data from 21 longitudinal cohorts (total of 76 220 participants; 4996 incident diabetes cases) and estimated a 38% risk reduction for incident diabetes in the highest versus the lowest category of blood 25(OH)D level. The association did not differ by sex, duration of follow-up, cohort sample size, 25(OH)D assay method, or diabetes diagnostic criteria. Afzal et al combined data from 16 longitudinal cohorts (total of 72 204 participants; 4877 incident diabetes cases) and reported that the bottom quartile of blood 25(OH)D level was associated with a 50% higher risk for incident diabetes compared with the top quartile. Ye et al included data from 22 longitudinal cohorts (89 698 noncases; 8492 diabetes cases) and reported that a 10-ng/mL lower 25(OH)D level was associated with a 22% higher risk of incident diabetes.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on markers for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116sJQy7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the causal role of vitamin D on noncommunicable disease outcomes is inconclusive.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are beneficial or harmful effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation according to subgroups of remeasured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] on cardiovascular and glucometabolic surrogate markers with the use of individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs.

Design

Twelve RCTs (16 wk to 1 y of follow-up) were included. For standardization, 25(OH)D concentrations for all participants (n = 2994) at baseline and postintervention were re-measured in bio-banked serum samples with the use of a certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method traceable to a reference measurement procedure. IPD meta-analyses were performed according to subgroups of remeasured 25(OH)D. Main outcomes were blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and triglycerides; parathyroid hormone (PTH); fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide; and 2-h glucose. In secondary analyses, other potential effect modifiers were studied.

Results

Remeasurement of 25(OH)D resulted in a lower mean 25(OH)D concentration in 10 of 12 RCTs. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c. Supplementation resulted in 10–20% lower PTH concentrations, irrespective of the 25(OH)D subgroups. The subgroup analyses according to achieved 25(OH)D concentrations showed a significant decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations after vitamin D supplementation in 25(OH)D subgroups with < 75, < 100, and < 125 nmol of -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.20, -0.00 mmol/L), -0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.18, -0.02 mmol/L), and -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.14, -0.00 mmol/L), respectively. Patient features that modified the treatment effect could not be identified.

Conclusions

For the main outcomes of blood pressure and HbA1c, the data support no benefit for vitamin D supplementation. For the secondary outcomes, in addition to its effect on PTH, we observed indications for a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation only on LDL cholesterol, which warrants further investigation. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02551835.

### Effects of vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk among people at risk of type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115Rmgrt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the effect of short‐term vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic outcomes among individuals with an elevated risk of diabetes.

Methods

In a double‐blind placebo‐controlled randomized trial, 340 adults who had an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes (non‐diabetic hyperglycaemia or positive diabetes risk score) were randomized to either placebo, 100 000vitamin(ergocalciferol) or 100 000vitamin(cholecalciferol), orally administered monthly for 4 months. The primary outcome was change in glycated haemoglobin between baseline and 4 months, adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes included: blood pressure; lipid levels; apolipoprotein levels; C‐reactive protein levels; pulse wave velocity; anthropometric measures; and safety of the supplementation.

Results

The mean [standard deviation (s.d.)] 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25D] 2 concentration increased from 5.2 (4.1) to 53.9 (18.5) nmol/l in thegroup, and the mean (s.d.) 25concentration increased from 45.8 (22.6) to 83.8 (22.7) nmol/l in thegroup. There was no effect of vitamin D supplementation on:versus placebo: −0.05% [95% confidence interval −0.11, 0.02] or −0.51 mmol/mol (95%−1.16, 0.14; p = 0.13); versus placebo: 0.02% (95%−0.04, 0.08) or 0.19 mmol/mol (95%−0.46, 0.83; p = 0.57). There were no clinically meaningful effects on secondary outcomes, except[versus placebo: −0.68 m/s (95%−1.31, −0.05); versus placebo −0.73 m/s (95%−1.42, −0.03)]. No important safety issues were identified.

Conclusions

Short‐term supplementation with vitaminorhad no effect on. The modest reduction inwith bothandrelative to placebo suggests that vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness.

Aims

To investigate the effect of short-term vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic outcomes among individuals with an elevated risk of diabetes.

Methods

In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial, 340 adults who had an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes (non-diabetic hyperglycaemia or positive diabetes risk score) were randomized to either placebo, 100,000 IU vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or 100,000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), orally administered monthly for 4 months. The primary outcome was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between baseline and 4 months, adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes included: blood pressure; lipid levels; apolipoprotein levels; C-reactive protein levels; pulse wave velocity (PWV); anthropometric measures; and safety of the supplementation.

Results

The mean [standard deviation (s.d.)] 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]2 concentration increased from 5.2 (4.1) to 53.9 (18.5) nmol/l in the D2 group, and the mean (s.d.) 25(OH)D3 concentration increased from 45.8 (22.6) to 83.8 (22.7) nmol/l in the D3 group. There was no effect of vitamin D supplementation on HbA1c: D2 versus placebo: -0.05% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11, 0.02] or -0.51 mmol/mol (95% CI -1.16, 0.14; p = 0.13); D3 versus placebo: 0.02% (95% CI -0.04, 0.08) or 0.19 mmol/mol (95% CI -0.46, 0.83; p = 0.57). There were no clinically meaningful effects on secondary outcomes, except PWV [D2 versus placebo: -0.68 m/s (95% CI -1.31, -0.05); D3 versus placebo -0.73 m/s (95% CI -1.42, -0.03)]. No important safety issues were identified.

Conclusions

Short-term supplementation with vitamin D2 or D3 had no effect on HbA1c. The modest reduction in PWV with both D2 and D3 relative to placebo suggests that vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness.

### Multivitamins, individual vitamin and mineral supplements, and risk of diabetes among older U.S. adults [^1113YGAp]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the lack of benefit of multivitamins on diabetes risk, we found that users of either vitamin C or calcium had a lower risk of diabetes than nonusers. The potential benefit of a vitamin C supplement seem to be limited to individuals who did not take multivitamins or had lower dietary intake of vitamin C, which is consistent with some evidence that suggests that dietary vitamin C intake may be suboptimal in the U.S. general population, especially among the elderly. Vitamin C is a potent water-soluble antioxidant and can effectively scavenge several reactive species and regenerate tocopherols and tocotrenols from their respective radical species. Vitamin C may also have a role in the energy-dependent release of insulin from pancreatic islets. Some small and short-term randomized trials have been conducted among patients with type 2 diabetes; some reported that vitamin C supplementation (1–2 g/day) reduced oxidative stress and improved endothelial function in diabetic patients. Further, a recent trial has shown suggestive evidence for vitamin C (500 mg/day) in preventing type 2 diabetes among women at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Because of limited data from randomized trials, our observational evidence of a potential benefit of vitamin C supplementation in diabetes prevention should serve as a stimulus for further investigation.

We found a consistent association of calcium supplementation with lower diabetes risk. It is difficult to argue that such residual confounding was specific to calcium but not to multivitamins or other micronutrient supplements. On the other hand, it is plausible that a potential beneficial effect of calcium on diabetes is partially mediated by its effects on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and body weight. Recently, animal and human studies indicated that high calcium intake might decrease levels of parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D (calcitriol) and thus influence adipocyte metabolism by inhibiting lipogenesis and stimulating lipolysis. Moreover, the biological effects of calcium may well depend on the presence or absence of other highly correlated nutrients, especially vitamin D. Our results did not show that dietary vitamin D intake modified the association between calcium supplement use and type 2 diabetes. Because of the lack of information on vitamin D contents in multivitamin supplements and the relatively low proportions of vitamin D supplement use, we cannot address the comparative importance of calcium and vitamin D in the observed associations. Further, we found no evidence for the association between calcium intake from diet alone and diabetes risk. Therefore, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the association between calcium supplement use and diabetes could be explained by unmeasured confounding.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116mEgZ4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium (prevention of diabetes), ES 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering empiric vitamin D supplementation, in addition to lifestyle modifications, in adult patients with high-risk prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes.

### Decreased serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol are associated with increased risk of progression to impaired fasting glucose and diabetes [^112Msjc4]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In our cohort, increased incidence of diabetes among subjects with low vitamin D is remarkable considering the relatively short follow-up period. The risk of progression to diabetes was higher among subjects with 25-OHD levels ≤ 25 nmol/L (NG to diabetes) and 37.5 nmol/L (IFG to diabetes) but not among those with higher 25-OHD levels. This is most likely explained by the short follow-up, which may not reveal the deleterious effects of mild vitamin D insufficiency, thus leading to underestimation of the impact of vitamin D on the risk of diabetes; however, the presence of a vitamin D level threshold above which there is no impact on the development of diabetes cannot be excluded.

In the Diabetes Prevention Program, the association between vitamin D levels and the risk of diabetes was linear in subjects at risk for diabetes. We maintain that future studies are needed to clarify whether our finding that vitamin D levels influence the risk of IFG or diabetes only below certain thresholds in fact holds true in other contexts.

Vitamin D insufficiency has been implicated in β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance, which may increase blood glucose at all stages of diabetes. The precise mechanisms involved are currently not known. Further studies are required to shed light on the role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of diabetes.

Despite the mounting evidence supporting the relationship between vitamin D and the risk of diabetes, the results of clinical trials and post hoc analyses on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic outcomes have been inconclusive (,–). Notably, in our cohort the risk of diabetes was reduced in subjects with initial low serum 25-OHD who had a documented increase in 25-OHD level relative to those with persistent low levels. In this retrospective population-based study, no information was available on how vitamin D deficiency was corrected in this group, precluding definitive conclusions as to the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of diabetes. Collectively, our findings suggest that vitamin D is an important determinant of glycemia along the whole spectrum of glucose metabolism and that increasing vitamin D level may reduce the risk of diabetes. Large-scale, randomized, controlled trials targeting different 25-OHD levels are required to assess the impact of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes prevention.

### Vitamin D supplementation has no effect on insulin sensitivity or secretion in vitamin D-deficient, overweight or obese adults: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^1169Q4CX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a potential strategy to prevent type 2 diabetes. Existing clinical trials have been limited by short duration, low doses of vitamin D, variability in participants' vitamin D-deficiency status, and the use of surrogate measures of body composition, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Objective: To address existing knowledge gaps, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation that is provided in a sufficient dose and duration to vitamin D-deficient individuals would improve insulin sensitivity or secretion as measured with the use of gold-standard methods. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would improve insulin sensitivity and secretion compared with placebo. Design: Sixty-five overweight or obese, vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration ≤ 50 nmol/L) adults were randomly assigned to receive either a bolus oral dose of 100,000 IU cholecalciferol followed by 4000 IU cholecalciferol/d or a matching placebo for 16 wk. Before and after the intervention, participants received gold-standard assessments of body composition (via dual X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (via hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), and insulin secretion [via intravenous-glucose-tolerance tests (IVGTTs)]. Results: Fifty-four participants completed the study [35 men and 19 women; mean ± SD age: 31.9 ± 8.5 y; body mass index (in kg/m 2): 30.9 ± 4.4]. 25(OH)D increased with vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo (57.0 ± 21.3 compared with 1.9 ± 15.1 nmol/L, respectively; P = 0.02). Vitamin D and placebo groups did not differ in change in insulin sensitivity (0.02 ± 2.0 compared with -0.03 ± 2.8 mg · kg -1 · min -1, respectively; P = 0.9) or first-phase insulin secretion (-21 ± 212 compared with 24 ± 184 mU/L, respectively; P = 0.9). Results remained nonsignificant after adjustment for age, sex, percentage of body fat, sun exposure, physical activity, and dietary vitamin D intake (P > 0.1). Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation does not improve insulin sensitivity or secretion in vitamin D-deficient, overweight or obese adults, despite using high-dose vitamin D supplementation and robust endpoint measures. Therefore, it is unlikely that vitamin D supplementation would be an effective strategy for reducing diabetes risk even in vitamin D-deficient populations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02112721.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Response to letter to the editor from dalan: "Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? " [^1126mRTy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

We thank Rinkoo Dalan for the comments on our paper. We agree that although the reduction in diabetes risk with vitamin D supplementation among people at high risk for diabetes appears to be moderate (~ 12% relative risk reduction compared to placebo), certain individuals may derive a higher (or lower) benefit based on certain characteristics. For example, in the simplest demonstration of such heterogeneity, vitamin D supplementation reduced diabetes risk by 62% among participants in the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study who had a baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level of less than 12 ng/mL (30 mmol/L).

Consistent with the focus of the scientific community on precision nutrition, we agree that we need to better understand responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation for specific outcomes of interest. The vitamin D response index is an interesting concept that reflects activation of the vitamin D receptor, and it is determined on the basis of measuring vitamin D–triggered changes in the expression of 24 target genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 12 clinical and biochemical parameters. There are at least 2 limitations: 1) Although such an index may reflect vitamin D–induced changes in specific response parameters, these changes may not necessarily translate to clinically meaningful outcomes, such as lowering diabetes risk. 2) Low-, mid-, and high-responders are determined with statistical means within a specific cohort but that can be calculated only retrospectively; specific cutoffs to define degree of response need to be established for use in real time in research or in the clinical setting.

The author also suggests that daily, steady exposure to vitamin D is preferred over intermittent exposure for optimal benefit, and we agree. In a secondary analysis from the D2d study, we reported that participants who received the active intervention (100 mcg [4000 units] of vitamin D 3 daily) and maintained high 25(OH)D levels that were stable throughout the trial period had the lowest risk of diabetes, whereas participants in the placebo group who maintained similar overall 25(OH)D levels that fluctuated during follow-up did not derive significant benefit.

Notably, in the observational studies, the highest category of 25(OH)D level (conferring the lowest risk of diabetes) was in the 25 to 30 ng/mL range, and the lowest category (conferring the highest risk of diabetes) was in the 10 to 15 ng/mL range. In the meta-analysis by Song et al, a spline regression model showed that higher blood 25(OH)D levels were monotonically associated with a lower diabetes risk, without an apparent plateau. However, few observational studies have included enough participants with 25(OH)D levels higher than 30 ng/mL; therefore, it is not clear whether achieving and maintaining higher 25(OH)D levels are associated with an even lower risk of diabetes.

Observational studies using Mendelian randomization approaches, which offer the potential advantage that the reported genetic associations with phenotypes may overcome the challenges of confounding and reverse causation, have shown inconsistent associations between certain alleles relevant to vitamin D physiology and incident type 2 diabetes. In a Danish study of 96 423 adults, genetic variants associated with low blood 25(OH)D levels predicted incident type 2 diabetes. However, other studies in different cohorts have reported no associations between genetic variants that specifically affect blood 25(OH)D level and incident diabetes. Mendelian randomization studies center upon certain assumptions that may not apply to vitamin D. Specifically, the tested alleles accounted for less than 5% of the variance in blood 25(OH)D level. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization studies did not predict the amounts of bioavailable or biologically active vitamin D and cannot distinguish between endogenous versus exogenous sources of vitamin D or long-term versus short-term exposure to vitamin D. In the study by Afzal et al, variation in the DHCR7 gene, which is associated with lower vitamin D biosynthesis, predicted risk of type 2 diabetes, suggesting that sustained, long-term exposure to vitamin D may be important for the prevention of diabetes. Mendelian randomization studies may also be confounded by pleiotropic effects of genetic variants and are further limited by the assumption of a linear association between genetic variants, blood 25(OH)D level, and diabetes risk, which may not hold. Despite their theoretical appeal, Mendelian randomization studies can neither support nor exclude a causal relationship between vitamin D and type 2 diabetes.

Most longitudinal observational studies have included people with an average risk of type 2 diabetes at baseline. The inverse association between blood 25(OH)D level and incident diabetes may be more pronounced among persons who are already at a high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112p24G5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — justification for the recommendation and targeting considerations indicate that the panel favored empiric vitamin D based on moderate certainty that it lowers progression to type 2 diabetes, likely without harm. The IPD-MA suggested greatest benefit among those with baseline 25(OH)D level lower than 12 ng/mL (20 nmol/L) (HR 0.58 [95% CI, 0.35–0.97]), but overall evidence did not support the net benefit of 25(OH)D testing in adults with prediabetes followed by supplementation only in those with low levels. Vitamin D supplementation that raises 25(OH)D may further lower diabetes risk but could potentially increase adverse effects (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, kidney stones), although there was no evidence of this in the IPD-MA.

### Study protocol: a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus SUNNY trial [^116sXUSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, represents a worldwide epidemic with significant co-morbidity and mortality due to microvascular and macrovascular complications. Although therapies for T2DM and its co-morbidity have improved over the last few decades, the need for new insights for the prevention and management of T2DM remains needed due to the increased impact of the disease. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that vitamin D status plays a role in many non-skeletal functions including diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is increasing with an estimating number of one billion people worldwide. A recent study in the Netherlands among older people revealed a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency of 47.8% (defined as 25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/l).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116wxPLo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — high-risk adults: Meta-analyses reported increased regression to normal glucose regulation with vitamin D versus placebo (RR 1.48 [95% CI, 1.14–1.92] and RR 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16–1.46]). Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults with high risk for diabetes by American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria. Dosing varied across trials, 4 studies used vitamin D2, and due to this variability the panel could not recommend a specific dosage of vitamin D. Over 3 years, absolute diabetes risk reductions were 24 fewer per 1000 (systematic review) or 33 fewer per 1000 (IPD-MA), compared with 70 fewer per 1000 with metformin, noting vitamin D in trials was applied in addition to recommended lifestyle changes.

Can alternative analyses help?

The ITT analyses are generally favored because of simplicity and because they alleviate concerns about confounding. However, although large scale trials are free of confounding when they start, biases may emerge during follow-up due to incomplete adherence to the trial intervention or use of rescue medications leading to postrandomization confounding, which may influence the estimate of treatment efficacy and study power. The ITT analyses are agnostic to postrandomization confounding, including treatment discontinuation and concomitant therapies (eg, rescue medications such as high-dose vitamin D or metformin in trials for the prevention of diabetes with vitamin D) not allowed by the study protocol; hence, ITT analyses estimate the effect of treatment assignment, not the effect of treatment itself.

Differential adherence (for any reason) to the assigned intervention and concomitant exogenous use of vitamin D are common challenges in vitamin D trials given the widespread laboratory testing for blood 25(OH)D in the routine clinical setting and the availability of over-the-counter vitamin D supplements at high doses. These factors have the significant potential to influence the estimate of efficacy of vitamin D intervention for the prevention of diabetes in clinical trials. For example, in the D2d study, although overall adherence to the protocol was high and overall use of rescue medications was low, a different pattern among nonadherent participants emerged between the 2 groups. Specifically, during follow-up, more participants in the placebo group started diabetes or weight-loss medications, which would make the detection of diabetes less likely. Furthermore, more participants in the placebo group took personal vitamin D supplements above the trial limit, likely due to testing outside of the study. These differences may have shifted the relative risk reduction towards null in the ITT analysis. In a prespecified, per-protocol analysis that censored follow-up when a D2d participant started a diabetes or weight-loss medication, stopped study pills, or took out-of-study vitamin D from supplements that were above the study limit, the risk of diabetes was significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71–1.00).

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^112GyZp2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Several prior RCTs of vitamin D supplementation provide conflicting evidence and on average, indicate no effect on intermediate biomarkers of glycemic and insulin homeostasis. A previous meta-analysis combined RCTs with various doses, formulations, and comparator interventions and reported no treatment effect for vitamin D on fasting glucose, HbA1c, or HOMA-IR levels after 4 to 52 weeks intervention. We also did not observe an effect of 2000 IU/d of cholecalciferol vs. placebo on these biomarkers after 2 years of treatment. In the placebo group, there was a decline in insulin sensitivity over time characterized by the Matsuda ISI, paralleling the increase in post-load insulin, and this did not occur for the vitamin D group. However, treatment group differences were not statistically significant. Our biomarker analyses further stratified by baseline characteristics did not indicate any statistically significant interactions of vitamin D with age, self-reported sex, omega-3 treatment group, race/ethnicity, or low vitamin D blood levels. Further, despite the suggested protective effect of vitamin D vs. placebo among BMI < 30 in the combined RCT meta-analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in glycemic trait outcomes by BMI. Collectively, while our findings suggest that the potential efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for T2D prevention, there is minimal impact of vitamin D vs. placebo on related glycemic traits after 2 years.

Findings from VITAL for other clinical endpoints indicate a modifying effect of BMI on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo for reducing cancer incidenceand mortality, and incidence of autoimmune diseases, with benefits limited to participants without obesity at enrollment. Moreover, vitamin D at levels above current clinical thresholds for deficiency may support glycemic health and/or protect against pancreatic β-cell destruction through several biological processes previously linked to vitamin D, including immune-modulation through blockade of dendritic cell differentiation, inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, and suppression of local or systemic inflammation. Previously published in the VITAL-CTSC, there was a significant 19% reduction in high sensitivity C-reactive protein with vitamin D that was sustained at 4 y. An effect was not observed for other biomarkers of inflammation, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, or tumor necrosis factor-α. Thus, it is plausible that vitamin D has systemic and broad-spectrum effects on immune function and other pathways that underlie potential benefits for several health outcomes and that may be modified by adiposity.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on prevention of type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZFtDp]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

While observational studies have shown an association between vitamin D insufficiency and diabetes, it is unclear whether intervention with vitamin D supplements can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Purpose

To assess whether vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of T2DM in people with prediabetes.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to 5 July 2019.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled trials assessing vitamin D supplementation versus placebo in relation to new-onset T2DM in people with prediabetes.

Data Extraction

We screened studies and extracted data from published trials independently.

Data Synthesis

We identified eight eligible trials with a total of 4,896 subjects. Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of T2DM (risk ratio [RR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.80–0.99]; I² = 0%). Benefit was found in nonobese subjects (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.57–0.92]) but not in obese subjects (RR 0.95 [95% CI 0.84–1.08]) (P interaction = 0.048). The reversion of prediabetes to normoglycemia occurred in 116 of 548 (21.2%) participants in the vitamin D group and 75 of 532 (14.1%) in the control group. Vitamin D supplementation increased reversion rate of prediabetes to normoglycemia (RR 1.48 [95% CI 1.14–1.92]; I² = 0%.) LIMITATIONS: Definitions of prediabetes and new-onset diabetes in eligible studies were different, and long-term data on outcomes of T2DM prevention were lacking.

Conclusions

In persons with prediabetes, vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of T2DM and increases the reversion rate of prediabetes to normoglycemia. The benefit of the prevention of T2DM could be limited to nonobese subjects. Individual participant data meta-analyses are needed to confirm these findings.

### Blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and incident type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective studies [^116X7gkh]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Our findings of an inverse relation between 25(OH)D and type 2 diabetes are supported by biological evidence that vitamin D may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. A large body of literature has suggested that optimal vitamin D homeostasis is essential for insulin action and secretion, two fundamental features in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Clearly, direct evidence from ongoing and future clinical trials of higher-dose vitamin D supplementation is warranted to clarify any beneficial effects of vitamin D on primary prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Findings from our meta-analysis of observational studies will augment and complement findings from randomized trials of the effect of vitamin D supplements on type 2 diabetes. Although randomized trials are critical for establishing cause-and-effect relationships between vitamin D supplementation and health outcomes, they will not address all the potential questions because of their fixed dose (or at most, a few doses) of vitamin D and narrow range of 25(OH)D levels achieved by supplementation. Prospective observational studies allow us to assess 25(OH)D thresholds for diabetes risk across a broad spectrum of 25(OH)D levels. The largest randomized trial of vitamin D supplement to date, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial, has evaluated vitamin D plus calcium supplementation for fracture prevention in > 36,000 postmenopausal women. Secondary analysis of the WHI trial with 33,951 initially nondiabetic women did not observe any effect from daily intake of 1,000 mg elemental calcium plus 400 IU vitamin D3 on incident diabetes over 7 years of follow-up. Of note, a dose of 400 IU/day vitamin D in the WHI raised median levels of serum 25(OH)D from 42.3 to only 54.1 nmol/L (∼12 nmol/L), which is below the optimal value of 75 nmol/L or more for skeletal and nonskeletal health including type 2 diabetes. Similarly, secondary analysis of another large randomized trial, the Randomized Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D (RECORD) trial, did not observe any effect from daily intake of 800 IU vitamin D3 on incident diabetes over 2–5 years, although such a daily dose raised serum 25(OH)D from 38 to 62 nmol/L on average.

### Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^11193asm]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitamin D may modify the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this review was to examine the association between vitamin D status and incident type 2 diabetes, and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic outcomes.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of English-language studies using MEDLINE through February 2011. Longitudinal cohort studies reporting associations between vitamin D status and incident type 2 diabetes, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation, were included. Study characteristics and results were extracted, and study quality was assessed.

Results

A total of 8 observational cohort studies and 11 RCTs were included. In meta-analyses of observational studies, vitamin D intake > 500 international units (IU)/day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 13% compared with vitamin D intake < 200IU/day. Individuals with the highest vitamin D status (> 25ng/ml) had a 43% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (95% confidence interval 24, 57%) compared with those in the lowest group (< 14ng/ml). In post hoc analyses from eight trials among participants with normal glucose tolerance at baseline and in three small underpowered (n = 32–62) trials of patients with established type 2 diabetes, there was no effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic outcomes. In two trials among patients with baseline glucose intolerance, vitamin D supplementation improved insulin resistance.

Conclusions

Vitamin D may play a role in type 2 diabetes; however, to better define the role of vitamin D in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, high-quality observational studies and RCTs that measure blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and clinically relevant glycemic outcomes are needed.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of interventional studies [^1127UDZS]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Studies with a follow up of ≤ 3 months were considered as short-term studies.

*(1) 50,000 U/week vitamin D + calcium placebo; (2) 1,000 mg/day calcium + vitamin D placebo (3) 50,000 U/week vitamin D + 1,000 mg/day calcium or (4) vitamin D placebo + calcium placebo.

1 Newly diagnosed pulmonary TB cases with uncontrolled diabetes. 2 Cholecalciferol 11200 IU daily for 2 weeks followed by 5600 IU daily.

Fourteen studies had assessed change in HbA1c over time after vitamin D supplementation. The study that had used calcitriol had the largest sample size (n = 119) and the results suggested a significant improvement in mean HBa1c after eight weeks from 8.4 to 7.1. Conversely the second study that had used calcitriol, found a paradoxical rise in HbA1c. But the sample size was smaller in this RCT (n = 35 in each group). However, authors noted that the use of calcitriol was associated with improvements in insulin secretion. Of the remaining studies that had used cholecalciferol and assessed change in HbA1c over time, five studies found significant improvement in HbA1C at three months. In the RCT conducted by Soric et al. patients with higher baseline HbA1c had a significantly greater reduction in HbA1C after 12 weeks. Similarly, in the RCT conducted by Sugden et al. HOMA parameters significantly improved though HbA1c remained constant. However, in the RCT that used a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D, HbA1c and HOMA-IR remained stable despite correction of low vitamin D status. Similar lack of improvement in HbA1c and HOMA-IR were noted in the RCT conducted by Witham and colleagues. In this study, a large single dose of vitamin D3 was used. Of particular note, one study that used hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique found that insulin sensitivity and HbA1c did not improve significantly. In summary, ten short-term studies found improvement in HbA1c, HOMA-B and HOMA-IR though only four studies had analyzed all three outcomes. QUICKI, an index of insulin sensitivity was shown to improve at 12 weeks in another RCT. Certain parameters such as glycemic control and serum vitamin D levels may have affected the response in glycemic parameters. For instance, in one RCT, HbA1c improvement was noted only in subjects who had a baseline HbA1c greater than 9%. Similarly, in the RCT conducted by Sugden et al. HOMA parameters significantly improved in patients who had a 25-OHvitamin D increase of 11 nmol/l or more.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112YtL7L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### What is the impact of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in people with type-2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trails [^112s3pQL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis found that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for the reduction of FPG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in patients with type 2 diabetes and deficient vitamin D status. This effect was especially prominent when vitamin D was given in large doses and for a short period of time albeit with substantial heterogeneity between studies and a probability of publication bias. In conclusion, this study is in agreement with previous findings on the potential of vitamin D supplementation along with other antidiabetic drugs to improve glycemic control and prevent diabetic complications.

### Role of 2-hour plasma glucose in assessing pre-diabetes risk: insights from the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study cohort [^117MNXcq]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Historically, an elevated level of 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) during a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was the hallmark of pre-diabetes. This measurement served as a primary criterion in pivotal diabetes prevention clinical trials, including the Diabetes Prevention Program. However, with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) expanding its diagnostic criteria for pre-diabetes in 2010 to include hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), clinical practice has shifted from measuring 2hPG to relying primarily on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c. This transition raises questions about the current role of 2hPG in assessing pre-diabetes risk in contemporary clinical settings.

The vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that tested whether oral vitamin D lowers the risk of developing diabetes in adults at risk of type 2 diabetes (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 01942694). Participants were eligible if they had "high-risk" pre-diabetes, which was defined as meeting 2 or 3 ADA glycemic criteria for pre-diabetes (FPG, 100–125 mg/dL; 2hPG, 140–199 mg/dL; HbA1c, 5.7–6.4%). Diabetes was diagnosed based on semiannual glycemic testing.

Analyzing the placebo cohort only, we found that 26.7% of participants (323 out of 1212) developed diabetes after a median follow-up of 2.5 years. More men than women developed diabetes (29% vs 23%, p = 0.02), but other demographic factors were similar, including age, race, and ethnicity (online supplemental table 1). To examine the diagnostic value of 2hPG in conjunction with FPG and HbA1c for predicting incident diabetes, we compared the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC AUC). With only FPG and HbA1c, the ROC AUC to predict incident diabetes at 36 months was 0.686. Adding 2hPG to FPG and HbA1c increased the ROC AUC to 0.736 (p = 0.002), improving the performance of glycemic measures to predict incident diabetes.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111crY8T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of prevalent type 2 diabetes and incident prediabetes: a prospective cohort study using data from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA) [^111qrA1U]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There have been several trials where vitamin D supplementation has been examined to prevent diabetes, and have not shown that it reduced the risk of diabetes. These studies have largely included those at highest risk of developing diabetes, namely those already with prediabetes, whereas this longitudinal observational study included development of prediabetes as an outcome. The participants in these interventional studies have also tended to have baseline vitamin D concentrations far higher, with very low levels of deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) and low levels of insufficiency (30 to < 50 nmol/L) than what has been shown in observational studies. For example, the D2d study, a randomised control trial with over 2000 participants, had mean vitamin D concentrations of 70 nmol/L, with 78% having concentrations ≥ 50 nmol/L and only 4.3% having concentrations < 30 nmol/L. This compares to a mean concentration of 58nmol/L, with 60% having concentrations ≥ 50 nmol/L and 11.5% having concentrations < 30 nmol/L of the 3828 participants included in this study. 22% of participants in the D2d study had vitamin D concentrations < 50 nmol/L, which is far less than what has been found in observational studies such as TILDA where 42.5% had vitamin D concentrations of < 50 nmol/L, or the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam where half had vitamin D concentrations < 50 nmol/L. While the hazard ratio for vitamin D supplementation in the D2d study was 0.88 (95% CI 0.75, 1.04, p = 0.12), when compared to placebo, a post hoc analysis of data for participants with baseline vitamin D concentrations of < 30 nmol/L showed a hazard ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.18, 0.80) for those in the vitamin D supplement group. Another criticism of some of the trials carried out to date has been that they may have been underpowered to test for the effect size they were examining. While this study did not show that low vitamin D concentrations at wave 1 were associated with an increased likelihood of incident diabetes at wave 3, as mentioned previously, only 110 participants developed diabetes between these waves, so these models too may have been underpowered. The results with prediabetes, however, suggest that longer follow-up of TILDA may provide the number of incident diabetes cases to potentially show significant associations in the future.

### Prevention or delay of diabetes and associated comorbidities: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115qBsYN]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) weight loss effects and adjunct pharmacologic evidence — In the DPP, every kilogram of weight loss conferred a 16% reduction in risk of progression over 3.2 years, and in individuals with previous history of gestational diabetes mellitus the risk of type 2 diabetes increased by 18% for every 1 unit BMI above the preconception baseline; several medications evaluated for weight loss (orlistat, phentermine and topiramate, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) have been shown to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those with prediabetes. Regarding vitamin D, three large trials (the Tromsø study in Norway, the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes [D2d] study in the U.S., and the Diabetes Prevention with Active Vitamin D [DPVD] study in Japan) reported that vitamin D therapy modestly reduced the risk of developing diabetes compared with placebo to a nearly identical degree in all three trials, but none of the individual trials were statistically significant.

### USPSTF recommendation: screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults… [^1149Fjct]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The USPSTF has published recommendations on the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls22 and fractures23 and vitamin supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. 24 These recommendations differ from the current recommendation statement in that they address vitamin D supplementation without first determining a patient's vitamin D status. Five RCTs reported on incident diabetes. Study duration ranged from 1 year to 7 years. A pooled analysis of the 5 trials found no difference in the incidence of diabetes among participants randomized to vitamin D treatment compared with placebo.
26. Two trials, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial 35 and the Vitamin D Assessment Study, 36 reported on cardiovascular events.

Both trials observed no statistically significant differences in cardiovascular events between the treatment and placebo groups among the subgroup of participants with serum vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline. Two trials, VITAL35 and a post hoc analysis of the ViDA trial, 37 and the WHI nested case-control study38, 39 reported on the effect of vitamin D treatment on the incidence of cancer. Both trials reported no difference in cancer incidence between participants randomized to treatment and placebo among the subgroup of participants with serum 25D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline. The ViDA trial had only 3 years of follow-up, which may be a short period to detect an effect on cancer incidence.

In the WHI Calcium–Vitamin D nested case-control study, the adjusted odds ratios for incident breast or colorectal cancer over 7 years of follow-up did not demonstrate a statistically significant association between exposure to active treatment and incidence of cancer among participants with vitamin D deficiency at baseline. 38, 39. Both reported no significant difference in depression measures between vitamin D treatment and placebo. 42, 43 Two trials reporting on physical functioning measures reported conflicting results. 44, 45 An unplanned subgroup analysis of 1 trial conducted in persons with impaired fasting glucose found no difference in incidence of a first urinary tract infection in participants with vitamin D deficiency who were treated with vitamin D compared with placebo.
46. When vitamin D deficiency is better defined, studies on the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency will be helpful.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and progression to diabetes in patients at risk for diabetes: an ancillary analysis in the diabetes prevention program [^111WxqAA]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In conclusion, higher vitamin D status, assessed by plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration measured repeatedly during follow-up, was associated with a lower risk of incident diabetes among people at high risk for the disease. If these results are confirmed in ongoing and planned randomized trials of vitamin D, they will have important public health implications because both of these interventions can be implemented easily and inexpensively to prevent progression of type 2 diabetes among those at high risk.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^115hCtXx]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Intervention studies have not demonstrated a consistent effect of vitamin D supplementation on body weight, glycemic control, or one or more aspects of the metabolic syndrome. The largest trial of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes is the Tromso study from Norway (511 white adults with prediabetes received 20,000 U/wk [∼2,900 U/d] vitamin D 3 or placebo; follow-up ∼3.3 years for incident diabetes). The risk of diabetes was lower in the vitamin D–supplemented group compared with placebo; however, the difference was not statistically significant (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.18). Subgroup analyses in subjects with low baseline serum 25OHD yielded similar results. Three recent meta-analyses have evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on one of three aspects of glycemic control in patients with established type 2 diabetes. Krul-Poel et al. evaluated 23 RCTs with a total of 1797 patients with type 2 diabetes. No significant effects were found on HbA1c, but vitamin D supplementation decreased fasting glycemia in subjects with poor baseline HbA1c. A second meta-analysis evaluated 24 RCTs, including 1528 patients with type 2 diabetes, and found a modest reduction in HbA1c (−0.3%), fasting blood glucose (-5mg/dl), or insulin resistance (all significant) following vitamin D supplementation with a mean daily dose of ∼4000 IU (or 100 μg) of vitamin D 3.

Results

The recruitment of participants for the trial and their follow‐up occurred between 2010 and 2012 and was continuous throughout all seasons over the recruitment period. Of 340 participants, 114 were randomized to placebo, 112 to D 2 and 114 to D 3 (Figure 1). The distribution of baseline demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics was similar across the treatment groups (Table 1). The percentages of participants who took all four doses of their randomized medication were 80.7% (placebo), 83.9% (D 2) and 86.8% (D 3; Figure 1).

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants by randomized group.

The percentages of individuals with a 25(OH)D concentration < 50 nmol/l at baseline were 58.8, 50.9 and 50.9% in the placebo, D 2 and D 3 groups, respectively; at follow‐up these percentages were 47.3, 4.5 and 3.5%. Mean (s.d.) 25(OH)D 2 concentrations increased in the D 2 group from 5.2 (4.1) nmol/l to 53.9 (18.5) nmol/l, and mean (s.d.) 25(OH)D 3 concentrations increased from 45.8 (22.6) nmol/l to 83.8 (22.7) nmol/l in the D 3 group. Between baseline and 4 months there was no overall change in concentrations of 25(OH)D 2, 25(OH)D 3 and total 25(OH)D in the placebo group (Figure 2). In contrast, in the D 2 group, the mean 25(OH)D 2 concentration increased by 48.7 (19.2) nmol/l, while the 25(OH)D 3 concentration decreased by 17.5 (22.1) nmol/l, and total 25(OH)D concentration increased by 31.2 (28.6) nmol/l. In the D 3 group there was no change in mean 25(OH)D 2 concentration, while 25(OH)D 3 and total 25(OH)D concentrations increased by 38.3 (24.2) nmol/l and 38.1 (23.8) nmol/l, respectively.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and progression to diabetes in patients at risk for diabetes: an ancillary analysis in the diabetes prevention program [^113vPL8Y]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The results from small clinical trials and post hoc analyses of larger trials on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemia or incident diabetes have been inconsistent In these studies, vitamin D appears to have beneficial effects only in people at risk for diabetes, which is consistent with the findings of the current study. In contrast, vitamin D supplementation appears to have no effect among those with normal glucose tolerance, or a very small effect that would require a very large sample population to detect. The studies that have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemia in patients with established type 2 diabetes were underpowered to draw any firm conclusions.

The hypothesis that vitamin D may be relevant to prevention of type 2 diabetes is biologically plausible. Both insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic β-cell function have been reported with vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D may have a direct effect mediated by binding of the active form, 1,25(OH) 2 D, to the vitamin D receptor expressed in pancreatic β-cells. The presence of the vitamin D response element in the human insulin gene promoter and transcriptional activation of the human insulin gene caused by 1,25(OH) 2 D further support a direct effect of vitamin D on insulin synthesis and secretion. Finally, activation of vitamin D may occur within the β-cell by 25-OHD-1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), which is expressed in β-cells.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of diabetes mellitus [^11235Mbp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains controversial because most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been small or have reported low doses of vitamin D.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of RCTs testing vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of T2DM.

Data Sources

Database search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed by 2 reviewers from inception through September 15, 2019.

Study Selection

We included RCTs that reported the effect of vitamin D supplementation for at least 1 year on T2DM prevention.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the incidence of T2DM.

Data Synthesis

Nine RCTs were included (43 559 participants). The mean age (standard deviation) was 63.5 (6.7) years. The RR for vitamin D compared with placebo was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90–1.03); P = 0.30. In trials testing moderate to high doses of supplementation (≥ 1000 IU/day), all conducted among participants with prediabetes, the RR for vitamin D compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79–0.99). In contrast, the trials testing lower doses, which were conducted in general population samples, showed no risk reduction (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94–1.10; P, interaction by dose = 0.04).

Conclusion

In patients with prediabetes, vitamin D supplementation at moderate to high doses (≥ 1000 IU/day), significantly reduced the incidence risk of T2DM, compared with placebo.

### Vitamin D and diabetes [^116LreH1]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes are considered multifactorial diseases in which both genetic predisposition and environmental factors participate in their development. Many cellular, preclinical, and observational studies support a role for vitamin D in the pathogenesis of both types of diabetes including: (1) T1D and T2D patients have a higher incidence of hypovitaminosis D; (2) pancreatic tissue (more specifically the insulin-producing beta-cells) as well as numerous cell types of the immune system express the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP); and (3) some allelic variations in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and VDR are associated with glucose (in)tolerance, insulin secretion, and sensitivity, as well as inflammation. Moreover, pharmacologic doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), the active form of vitamin D, prevent insulitis and T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and other models of T1D, possibly by immune modulation as well as by direct effects on beta-cell function. In T2D, vitamin D supplementation can increase insulin sensitivity and decrease inflammation. This article reviews the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of T1D and T2D, focusing on the therapeutic potential for vitamin D in the prevention/intervention of T1D and T2D as well as its complications.

### No protective effect of calcitriol on β-cell function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes: the IMDIAB XIII trial [^112fMrqH]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated whether supplementation of the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) in recent-onset type 1 diabetes can protect beta-cell function evaluated by C-peptide and improve glycemic control assessed by A1C and insulin requirement.

Research Design and Methods

Thirty-four subjects (aged 11–35 years, median 18 years) with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and high basal C-peptide > 0.25 nmol/l were randomized in a double-blind trial to 0.25 microg/day calcitriol or placebo and followed-up for 2 years.

Results

At 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up, A1C and insulin requirement in the calcitriol group did not differ from the placebo group. C-peptide dropped significantly (P < 0.001) but similarly in both groups, with no significant differences at each time point.

Conclusions

At the doses used, calcitriol is ineffective in protecting beta-cell function in subjects (including children) with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and high C-peptide at diagnosis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114kVDUt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — vitamin D for adults with prediabetes: In adults with prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Technical remarks specify that lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes, and that trials primarily related to adults with high-risk prediabetes identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge). Across trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels reported that the baseline mean 25(OH)D level in the 11 trials was 12 to 28 ng/mL (30–70 nmol/L), and among trials without baseline 25(OH)D as an eligibility criterion the baseline mean level of 25(OH)D was 18 to 28 ng/mL (45–70 nmol/L).

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of interventional studies [^114R9N7F]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Given the existence of many such challenges in the management if diabetes, researchers have been exploring the role of modifiable factors to manage type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are being increasingly recognized world-wide. Serum 25 (OH) D levels have even been linked to mortality in the general population. Vitamin D level in plasma has been linked to the occurrence of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Though epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between low serum 25(OH) vitamin D and glucose intolerance, intervention trials using vitamin D have produced mixed results. Epidemiological data also suggest a possible link between low vitamin D and diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy.

Recent observational data reports a beneficial effect of vitamin D on preventing the onset of diabetes. But the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control are still debated. A meta-analysis in 2012 that included longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported a small improvement on fasting glucose and insulin resistance but no beneficial effect was seen on HbA1c. However, studies included in this meta-analysis were heterogeneous in terms of the study subjects as healthy subjects, and those with impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes were included. Clearly long-term studies were lacking. Further, the dose of supplemental vitamin D and duration of follow-up varied widely across the studies. The number of eligible studies was also small and data on HbA1C, a better marker of glycemic status was available only from four studies. Moreover, many studies did not analyze the effect of all possible confounders. In addition, more studies have been published in the two years since this review. So it is important to update available evidence in this regard.

Aims

Thus we conducted a systematic review of prospective studies and randomized controlled trials that assessed the role of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic outcomes related to type 2 diabetes. The purpose of our review is to synopsize the present knowledge on this topic.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^111JmL5T]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Despite observational studies consistently confirming lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations in patients with T2D or metabolic syndrome, most MR studies have not supported these conclusions. In a small subgroup of individuals with obesity and prediabetes, supplementation provided some modest benefit, albeit lower than lifestyle modifications or metformin. Of note, daily vitamin D supplementation (4000 IU) in the large D2d trial did not retard the progression of prediabetes into T2D. A post hoc and meta-analysis, however, suggested a possible beneficial effect in individuals with vitamin D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) at baseline or in participants who were able to achieve consistently high (≥ 100 nmol/L) serum 25(OH)D levels. Furthermore, analysis of the combined results of the D2d (US), Tromsø (Norway), and DPVD (Japan) RCTs — which were specifically designed and conducted to test whether vitamin D reduces the risk of diabetes in adults with prediabetes — showed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of developing T2D in people with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency. In all 3 trials, the risk for diabetes was reduced in the group assigned to vitamin D compared to the placebo group, which did so in a remarkably similar way. The observed differences missed statistical significance in any trial because the reported risk reductions were smaller than each trial was powered to detect. An updated individual participant data meta-analysis of the same trials showed that vitamin D reduced the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 15%. Also, vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30%, with no evidence of risk. In additional analyses, participants in the vitamin D group who maintained intratrial blood 25(OH)D of 50 ng/mL or greater (≥ 125 nmol/L) had a 76% risk reduction in new-onset diabetes compared to those who maintained blood 25(OH)D of 20 to 29 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L). All participants received and were encouraged to follow the current lifestyle-based advice for diabetes prevention. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D to lower the risk of developing T2D in adults with prediabetes is favorable. These results should not be extrapolated to the general population at low or average risk for diabetes, as the benefit-to-risk ratio of high doses for diabetes prevention may not be favorable. Despite these promising results, some questions remain, that is, the optimal vitamin D dose or formulation and the specific blood 25(OH)D level to maximize benefit with little or no risk of any side effects.

### Effects of vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk among people at risk of type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115Np9KQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Mean [standard deviation (s.d.)] change in serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25D] 2, 25D 3 and total 25D concentration (nmol/l) from baseline to 4 months follow‐up, by randomized group. Circles = 25D 2; diamonds = 25D 3; squares = 25D.

Figure 3 shows that there was no evidence of a difference between the placebo and vitamin D groups for the primary outcome, HbA1c: the difference comparing D 2 with placebo was −0.05% (95% CI −0.11, 0.02) or −0.51 (95% CI −1.16, 0.14) mmol/mol (p = 0.13), and for D 3 versus placebo it was 0.02% (95% CI −0.04%, 0.08%) or 0.19 (95% CI −0.46, 0.83) mmol/mol (p = 0.57). Among the secondary outcomes, there were no differences comparing D 2 with placebo (Figure 4 A) or D 3 with placebo (Figure 4 B) for anthropometric measures, blood pressure, hsCRP, CVD risk, assessed by UKPDS risk engine, hepatic markers, or fructosamine. In the D 2 group there were small, but statistically significant, decreases from baseline relative to placebo in total cholesterol and ApoB (favouring D2), as well as in HDL cholesterol and ApoA1 (favouring placebo; Figure 4 A). In the D 3 group, there was a very small decrease in ApoB concentration between baseline and follow‐up relative to placebo (Figure 4 B). There was an increase in PTH in the D 2 group, but the difference between D 2 and placebo was not statistically significant (Figure 4 A). There was a decrease in PTH in the D 3 group between baseline and follow‐up that was significantly different from the increase seen in the placebo group (Figure 4 B). There was a reduction from baseline in PWV in both the D 2 [mean (s.d.) −0.17 (2.5) m/s] and D 3 [mean (s.d.) −0.75 (2.1) m/s] groups, relative to placebo [treatment difference D 2 vs placebo: −0.68 (95% CI −1.31,−0.05) m/s; D 3 vs placebo: −0.73 (95% CI −1.42, −0.03) m/s; Figure 4 A, B]. In the per‐protocol population the findings were similar overall, but of greater magnitude, in particular for PWV, for which the treatment differences were −0.79 (95% CI −1.43, −0.14) m/s for D 2 versus placebo, and −1.01 (95% CI −1.69, −0.34) m/s for D 3 versus placebo.

### Safety and tolerability of high-dose daily vitamin dsupplementation in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study-a randomized trial in persons with prediabetes [^1145P8SQ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention and Procedures

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to take once-daily, a soft-gel containing either 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) or matching placebo, with stratification by site, BMI (< 30 or ≥ 30 kg/m 2), and race (White or non-White). Participants and all study staff were blinded to treatment assignment. Participants were asked to limit the use of outside-of-study vitamin D to 1000 IU per day from all supplements. To optimize safety, participants were also asked to limit calcium supplements to 600 mg per day.

In-person follow-up visits occurred at month 3, month 6, and twice per year thereafter. Midway between the in-person visits starting after month 6, an interim contact (phone or email) took place. All visits and contacts were designed to promote retention, encourage adherence, and assess for diabetes diagnosis outside of the study, tolerability of study pills, occurrence of adverse events, and personal use of vitamin D supplements higher than allowed by study protocol. Participants were monitored for adverse events (AE) including those previously associated with vitamin D supplementation, and incident AEs were ascertained at visits and interim encounters 4 times a year in a similar manner in both groups. The protocol outlined in detail the safety parameters for which the study trial pills should be discontinued (e.g. nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, low eGFR, etc.).

Vitamin D content of study trial pills was analyzed for each production lot at bottling for the vitamin D 3 pills as well as for placebo pills to confirm they were free of vitamin D. Acceptable vitamin D 3 content for the active vitamin D pill was pre-defined as 80–120% of the 4000 IU planned dosage.

### Effects of vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk among people at risk of type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1128p4s6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

While overall the total 25(OH)D concentrations were increased in both D 2 and D 3 groups in the present trial, the magnitude of increase in 25(OH)D was greater with D 3 supplementation (mean increase of 38.3 nmol/) than with D 2 supplementation (mean increase of 31.2 nmol/l), in keeping with a previous meta‐analysis comparing the effects of supplementation with D 2 or D 3 13 and with trials conducted since then 14, 38. This may be partially attributable to the shorter half‐life of 25(OH)D 2 versus 25(OH)D 3 in the circulation, which is related to the lower affinity of the D 2 metabolite for the vitamin D‐binding protein 39. It might also reflect our finding that supplementation with vitamin D 2 led to a decrease in 25(OH)D 3 concentrations, as also observed in non‐trial settings by others 40, 41, while supplementation with vitamin D 3 did not affect 25(OH)D 2 concentrations in the present trial. The decrease in 25(OH)D 3 concentrations in the D 2 group may suggest different bioavailability 38, possible more rapid metabolism or clearance of circulating 25(OH)D 3 following D 2 supplementation, or competition for enzymatic activity by CYP2R1 for 25‐hydroxylation of vitamin D 2 and D 3 41. It has been suggested that an upregulation in mechanisms required to metabolize D 2 and its metabolites may increase the degradation of circulating 25(OH)D 3 concentrations 42 but the biological significance of these changes is currently unclear.

The strengths of the present trial include the cohort of adults from different ethnic groups, of varying ages and both sexes, and the use of a relatively high dose of vitamin D supplementation at the daily equivalent dose of 3300 IU per day that was effective in raising 25(OH)D concentrations. The comparison of both vitamin D 3 and vitamin D 2 against placebo for cardiometabolic outcomes is novel. Our inclusion of several relevant secondary endpoints and the assessment of the feasibility and safety of 25(OH)D in relatively high doses given monthly in a general population unscreened for 25(OH)D concentrations, with high degree of participant retention, increases generalizability in clinical practice. Enrolling participants irrespective of baseline vitamin D status was intentional to enable feasibility of a 'real‐life' trial that would not require pre‐recruitment assessment, and our examination of any differential effects by baseline 25(OH)D concentration in interaction analyses highlighted no benefits in those with hypovitaminosis D.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on type 2 diabetes biomarkers: an umbrella of interventional meta-analyses [^114bWZi3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The current umbrella review of meta-analysis, was performed in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD42021292700). Search strategy

A comprehensive online search for relevant published records was conducted from inception until March 2022, using Scopus, Web of Science databases, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Based on MeSH and text keywords, the following pattern of search was applied: "vitamin d" OR "ergocalciferols" OR "supplementation "OR "vitamin d3″ OR "vitamin d2″ OR "intake" AND "blood glucose" OR "Glucose" OR "FBS" OR "HOMA-IR" OR "insulin sensitivity" OR Insulin" OR "HbA1c" OR "insulin resistance" AND "systematic review" OR "meta-analysis". To enhance the sensitivity of the search approach, the wild-card phrase " was used. Database searches were done by two authors (VM and MV). Hand searches were also conducted on the reference lists of related articles to ensure that no studies were missed. We included English-language publications.

Study selection

Meta-analyses investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on T2DM biomarkers (FBS, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA-IR) providing the effect sizes (ESs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were considered eligible for including in this umbrella meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies with the following criteria were excluded: observational studies, quasi-experimental studies, case reports, conference papers, letters, in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies, controlled clinical trials, studies with insufficient data, and studies without full texts. The paper selection process was completed by two independent reviewers (ZK and VM), and any disagreements came into a consensus through discussing with a senior author (PD).

Data extraction

Two independent reviewers (ZK, and MV) extracted the following information from included studies: the first author, publication year, location of the project, study population and sample size, dosage and duration range of Vitamin D, ESs and CIs [(standardized mean difference (SMD), and weighted mean difference (WMD)] regarding study outcomes. The disagreements were consulted by a third reviewer (VM).

### Effects of vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk among people at risk of type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^117NDQMZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Sample Size

Sample size calculations estimated that 207 participants (69 per randomized group) were required to detect a 2.19 mmol/mol (0.2%) difference in mean HbA1c between the placebo and either vitamin D 2 or vitamin D 3 groups with 90% power and a 5% significance level, assuming a standard deviation (s.d.) of HbA1c of 5.47 mmol/mol (0.5%). To detect a 5‐mmHg difference in mean systolic blood pressure between randomized groups, assuming an s.d. of 16 mmHg 15, yielded a requirement of 339 participants (113 in each group). Finally, to detect a 0.5‐m/s difference in PWV and assuming an s.d. of 1 m/s (S.E. Greenwald, unpublished observation), required 162 participants (54 in each group).

Randomization and Blinding

Participants were randomized on a 1:1:1 basis within four strata defined by age (30–50 or 51–75 years) and sex, with a block size of six within each stratum. The order of treatments within each block was determined by a computer‐generated pseudo‐random sequence, generated by the IMP manufacturer (Nova Laboratories, Leicester, UK). Neither the participants, investigators, nor the laboratory staff knew the treatment allocation.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

Two reviewers (M. A.F, M.M) independently screened studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. First, the title and abstract of all retrieved studies were screened to identify potentially relevant articles. Studies judged to be relevant were selected for full-text review. During the full-text screening, each article was analyzed by both reviewers which determined whether the article qualified for inclusion. Any conflicting decisions between reviewers to include a given study were resolved initially by consensus, but in case of no resolution, a third author (L. A) was consulted for the final decision. Additionally, if the data was not available or unclear in the published article, the author was contacted by e-mail to request the necessary data.

We evaluated the methodological quality of each included trial using the validated 6-item Cochrane risk of the bias assessment tool, 2009. Using this tool, each study was assigned a "high", "some concerns" or "low" score for each of the following items: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personal; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data and other sources of bias.

Required data from each eligible study were extracted by two independent investigators. The mean and standard deviation (SD) and corresponding 95% CIs for the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control were extracted from each study. Study information (authors, year, country, sample size), participants' characteristics (gender, age, body mass index (BMI), vitamin D status), vitamin D supplementation characteristics (treatment, type, dose, and therapy duration), and results (baseline and post-intervention serum vitamin D, FBG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR) were extracted. Serum vitamin D status was defined as deficient (serum 25(OH)D concentrations < 50 nmol/l), insufficient (50–75 nmol/l), and sufficient (> 75 nmol /l).

### Prevalence and trends in dietary supplement use among US adults with diabetes: the national health and nutrition examination surveys, 1999–2014 [^115SKFa9]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Although some experts do not support the role of dietary supplements in preventing and treating diseases, suggestive beneficial effects of several antioxidant vitamins have been shown in some clinical trialsand might account for the increased trend of vitamin supplement use among patients with diabetes. Contrary to the decreased use in MVMM over years, use of any vitamin products slightly increased from 47% in 1999–2000 to 52% in 2013–2014. After excluding the use of MVMM, the increase in the prevalence of vitamin product use almost doubled from 11% in 1999–2000 to 20% in 2013–2014. This observation was consistent with the report among generally healthy US adults that the increase in use of any vitamin productswas due to an increased use in individual or combined vitamins.

In particular, it was worthwhile to note that vitamin D use significantly increased from 34% in 1999–2000 to 43% in 2013–2014. Emerging evidence based on systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that vitamin D may be beneficial to patients with diabetes due to its favorable effects on insulin action and secretion as well as other metabolic outcomes. However, recent reports from large-scale randomized controlled trials of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes have been disappointing. Solid evidence of the beneficial effects of vitamin D on type 2 diabetes from other well-designed and conducted randomized controlled trials would be expected to have a profound impact on future trends in vitamin D or any vitamin use among healthy individuals or patients with diabetes for health promotion.

### Vitamin D and diabetes [^115mcuHL]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

There is no doubt that vitamin D deficiency is the cause of several metabolic bone diseases, but vitamin D status is also linked to many major human diseases including immune disorders. Mounting data strengthen the link between vitamin D and diabetes, in particular T1D and T2D. Despite some inconsistencies between studies that associate serum 25(OH)D levels with the risk of developing T1D or T2D, there seems to be an overall trend for an inverse correlation between levels of 25(OH)D and both disorders. There is also compelling evidence that 1,25(OH)2D regulates b-cell function by different mechanisms, such as influencing insulin secretion by regulating intracellular levels of Ca2+, increasing β-cell resistance to apoptosis, and perhaps also increasing β-cell replication. The capacity of vitamin D, more specifically 1,25(OH)2D, to modulate immune responses is of particular interest for both the therapy and prevention of diabetes. In the case of T1D, vitamin D supplementation in prediabetic individuals could help prevent or reduce the initiation of autoimmune processes possibly by regulating thymic selection of the T-cell repertoire, decreasing the numbers of autoreactive T cells, and inducing Treg cells. Although immune modulation is generally discussed for the treatment of T1D, it is also relevant for T2D. Indeed, recent studies have shown that T2D patients have increased systemic inflammation and that this state can induce β-cell dysfunction and death. Supplementation trials with regular vitamin D for the protection against the development of T1D and T2D have generated some contradictory data, but many weaknesses can be identified in these trials as most were underpowered or open-labeled. However, the overwhelming strength of preclinical data and of the observational studies make vitamin D or its analogues strong candidates for the prevention or treatment of diabetes or its complications. However, proof of causality needs well-designed clinical trials and if positive, adequate dosing, regimen, and compound studies are needed to define the contribution of vitamin D status and therapy in the global diabetes problem. There are many confounding factors that need to be taken into consideration when translating successful vitamin D therapies in animal models into humans, for example, gender, age, lifestyle, and genetic background. To come to solid conclusions on the potential of vitamin D or its analogues in the prevention of or therapy for all forms of diabetes, it is clear that large prospective trials with carefully selected populations and end points will be needed, but should also receive high priority.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and risk of incident type 2 diabetes in women [^1134Bano]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that raising 25-OHD concentration may be an effective strategy at reducing risk of incident type 2 diabetes in women. Because observational studies of vitamin D have a high potential for confounding, our results need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials specifically designed to test such a hypothesis.

Data extraction

Three investigators (Y.S. L.W. and L.C.D.G.) independently reviewed each eligible article and extracted relevant data examining the prospective associations of circulating levels of 25(OH)D with type 2 diabetes risk. Differences, if any, were reconciled through group discussion. Data extracted include population source, study design, follow-up period, sample size, subject characteristics (age, sex, and comorbid conditions), 25(OH)D assay methods, diabetes end points, and main study findings. When results were available only on different subpopulations in the same study, we separately extracted data for each subpopulation (study characteristics described in).

### Effect of moderate-dose vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity in vitamin D-deficient non-Western immigrants in the Netherlands: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^114GLhv5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations have been associated with insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Because many non-Western immigrants in the Netherlands are vitamin D deficient, obese, and at high risk of diabetes, vitamin D supplementation may contribute to prevent diabetes and insulin resistance.

Objective

We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity and β cell function in overweight, vitamin D-deficient, non-Western immigrants at high risk of diabetes.

Design

The study was a 16-wk, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 130 non-Western immigrants with prediabetes (fasting glucose concentration > 5.5 mmol/L or random glucose concentration from 7.8 to 11.1 mmol/L) and vitamin D deficiency (serum 25[OH]D concentration < 50 nmol/L) were randomly assigned after stratification by sex to receive either cholecalciferol (1200 IU/d) or a placebo for 16 wk. All participants received 500 mg Ca/d as calcium carbonate. The primary outcome was the difference in the area under the curve of insulin and glucose after a 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test after 4 mo of treatment. Secondary outcomes were insulin-sensitivity variables, β cell-function variables, and metabolic syndrome.

Results

Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased significantly in the vitamin D compared with placebo groups. After 4 mo of therapy, the mean between-group difference was 38 nmol/L (95% CI: 32.1, 43.9 nmol/L; P < 0.001). There was no significant effect on insulin sensitivity and β cell function. In a post hoc analysis, when patients with diabetes at baseline were excluded, a significant increase in the insulinogenic index was observed in participants who obtained a 25(OH)D concentration ≥ 60 nmol/L (P = 0.040).

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation in non-Western vitamin D-deficient immigrants with prediabetes did not improve insulin sensitivity or β cell function or change the incidence of metabolic syndrome. However, after the exclusion of diabetic subjects, an improvement in the insulinogenic index was observed in participants who obtained a 25(OH)D concentration ≥ 60 nmol/L. This trial was registered at trialregister.nl as NTR1827.

### Effects of vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation on glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk among people at risk of type 2 diabetes: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115h5Qum]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among individuals who are at elevated risk of future diabetes, monthly supplementation for 4 months with vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 at a dose equivalent to 3300 IU/day was efficacious in raising concentrations of 25(OH)D 2 and 25(OH)D 3, respectively, but there were no differences between the placebo and either of the vitamin D supplementation groups for the primary outcome of change in HbA1c concentration. The null effects of vitamin D supplementation on HbA1c, blood pressure and inflammation in the present study suggest that vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to have major benefit for diabetes prevention or cardiometabolic risk. Nevertheless, the reduction we observed in arterial stiffness, as assessed by PWV, is of interest. The trial also showed the feasibility of relatively high dose supplementation over 4 months in a population unscreened for baseline 25(OH)D concentrations.

The null findings for change in HbA1c are in keeping with evidence from clinical trials appraised in two previous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses 2, 3. Evidence from vitamin D supplementation trials conducted subsequently to these meta‐analyses is also supportive of no significant effect on HbA1c concentrations 4, 10, 21. One trial did report a net benefit, with 0.2% lower HbA1c concentration in the vitamin D‐supplemented group (n = 56) versus placebo (n = 53), but this trial differed from other published work substantially, with very‐high‐dose vitamin D 3 supplementation (a mean dose of ∼88 000 IU/week, equivalent to > 12 000 IU/day), longer duration of the intervention (for 1 year), and participants restricted to those of Latino or African‐American ethnicity, together with presence of both impaired glucose regulation [HbA1c of 5.8–6.9% (40–52 mmol/mol)], plus impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, and hypovitaminosis‐D defined as 25(OH)D concentrations < 75 nmol/l 5. Notably, no other marker of glycaemia or insulin resistance differed by treatment group in that trial.

### Vitamin D and diabetes [^117C9u3m]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

There has been increasing evidence that vitamin D may have a role in modifying risk of diabetes. Vitamin D has both direct and indirect effects on various mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, including pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, impaired insulin action and systemic inflammation. This article describes the biologic plausibility behind the potential association between vitamin D and type 2 diabetes and summarizes the current evidence from human studies that suggests but does not prove a relation between vitamin D and type 2 diabetes, and briefly reports on the potential association between vitamin D and type 1 diabetes.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis of efficacy outcomes used an intention‐to‐treat population, which included all participants in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment actually received. A secondary analysis used a per‐protocol population, which excluded individuals who did not take all doses of the IMP. The analysis of safety endpoints used a safety population, which included all participants in the group based on treatment actually received, thus it was identical to the intention‐to‐treat population.

The baseline characteristics of the study population were summarized separately within each randomized group using means and s.d. values (continuous variables), medians and interquartile ranges (skewed variables), or numbers and percentages (categorical variables). Change in HbA1c from baseline to 4 months was compared separately between each treatment group (D 2 and D 3) and placebo, using analysis of covariance, with adjustment for baseline and centre. To ensure that participants with missing baseline values for the outcome could be included in the analysis, the missing indicator method was used 20. An analysis was performed to check whether adjusting for age and sex (the randomization stratifiers) in themodel had any impact on the estimated treatment effects, with an a priori agreement not to include them in the model if the impact was minimal.

For each of the secondary efficacy outcomes, differences between each treatment group and placebo, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated using the same method as that described for the primary outcome. Continuous outcomes with skewed distributions [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hsCRP] were natural log transformed. To enable the treatment differences for all efficacy outcomes to be reported on the same scale, each estimated difference and CI was divided by the s.d. of the relevant outcome at baseline. The number and percentage of participants experiencing any safety endpoints were reported within each randomized group. For the primary endpoint, prespecified interactions between treatment group and baseline HbA1c, and treatment group and baseline 25(OH)D were tested by including multiplicative interaction terms in themodel. For the primary efficacy endpoint only, an exploratory analysis was performed in which a difference between the D 2 and D 3 groups was estimated usingas described above. All analyses were performed using13 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA).

### Study protocol: a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus SUNNY trial [^114fke7F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main purpose of this study is to measure the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control and health related quality of life in patients with T2DM. There is widespread interest in the potential causal role of vitamin D on the pathogenesis and progression of T2DM. We hope this study will give new insight into this causality. Until now conflicting results are seen in observational studies and the few clinical trials performed, which could not confirm a causal association. Factors for the lack of effect found in these studies includes: short trial duration, relatively low doses of vitamin D supplementation whether or not combined with calcium supplements, and heterogeneous study populations.

This trial has several strengths: the study sample size allows us to perform a subgroup analysis of vitamin D deficient patients. Taken into account that only in vitamin D deficient patients an effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control will be found, we chose to recruit double the number of participants as calculated with the power estimation, hypothesizing that 50% of the included patients will be vitamin D deficient (serum 25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/l). Secondary, the relatively high dose chosen for intervention and the duration of the trial are strengths of our study. The dose of vitamin D supplementation of 50,000 IU of vitamin D per month (daily equivalent ~1667 IU) is based on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine and on the study done by van Groningen et al. In this latter study, performed in the Netherlands, it was demonstrated that a cumulative dose of 100,000 IU given in 2 months increases the serum 25 (OH) D meanly with 29 nmol/l. Assuming that the mean serum 25 (OH) D in our study population will be around 50 nmol/l at baseline, the serum 25 (OH) D should be raising to a sufficient status (≥ 75 nmol/l) in two months. To measure a difference in HbA 1c level we hypothesize that the maximal effect will be seen at least at six months, regarding the fact that the red blood cells circulate about 100 days in the blood and HbA 1c levels takes around six weeks to change. Furthermore, this is the first study examining the association between vitamin D status and skin autofluorescence value as well as the effect on skin AGEs after vitamin D supplementation. For this secondary outcome the duration of our trial will be a limitation, regarding the stability and long half-life of skin AGEs with could be the cause to find no effect of vitamin D supplementation on skin AGEs.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of interventional studies [^111d2djX]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes and vitamin D deficiency are global epidemics. Researchers have long been exploring the role of potentially modifiable factors to manage type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic review of prospective studies and randomized controlled trials that involved vitamin D supplementation and specifically intended to study glycemic outcomes related to type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Two authors independently searched Medline and PubMed for longitudinal studies that had assessed the effect of vitamin D supplements on glycemic control, insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in patients with diabetes.

Results

Seventeen randomized control trials and seven longitudinal studies with a minimum follow-up of one month were included.

Results of the various short-term studies (follow up ≤ 3 months) suggested that vitamin D supplementation had a positive impact on glycemic control and metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. However, the evidence was weak due to the low methodological quality of the studies. There was no significant effect on HbA1c, beta cell function and insulin resistance in the long-term studies (follow up > 3 months). There existed heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies, inclusion criteria, mode of supplementation of vitamin D and the duration of follow up.

Conclusions

Current evidence based on randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies do not support the notion that vitamin D supplementation can improve hyperglycemia, beta cell secretion or insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Large-scale trials with proper study design, optimal vitamin D supplementation and longer follow up need to be conducted.
