## Question

What is the optimal T3 to rT3 ratio for patients with hypothyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the optimal T3 to reverse T3 (rT3) ratio is for patients with hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any authoritative guideline or high-quality evidence defines a therapeutic T3:rT3 ratio target. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts in which rT3 and T3:rT3 are actually measured and why. Next, I will examine whether combination T4/T3 therapy changes the T3:rT3 ratio in a clinically meaningful way. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based answer and monitoring approach, making sure I don't over-interpret limited data or extrapolate from rare diseases to routine care.

> Let me first confirm the core question: is there a defined "optimal" T3:rT3 ratio used to guide therapy in hypothyroidism, and if so, what is it numerically and supported by which sources. Wait, let me verify the major guidelines and reviews. The American Thyroid Association's commissioned reviews explicitly state that measurement of rT3 and calculation of the T3:rT3 ratio are not recommended in routine clinical practice, except for rare entities like consumptive hypothyroidism or specific genetic disorders, and there is no endorsed therapeutic T3:rT3 target for hypothyroidism management [^c174a94b]. I should also confirm that contemporary endocrine guidelines similarly do not incorporate T3:rT3 targets into treatment algorithms, which they do not [^32fb5434].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the limited contexts where T3:rT3 is actually used diagnostically. The 2024 European Thyroid Association guidelines on genetic disorders of thyroid hormone transport, metabolism, and action recommend documenting elevated rT3 and an elevated rT3-to-T3 ratio when considering a deiodinase type 1 defect, but this is a diagnostic, not therapeutic, application and pertains to rare diseases rather than routine hypothyroidism care [^6fd402c5]. Similarly, neonatal screening work has explored T3:rT3 patterns to detect MCT8 deficiency, again a niche diagnostic use rather than a treatment target for typical hypothyroid patients [^3b08299f] [^2249df66]. I should double-check that these are the only endorsed scenarios, and yes, authoritative summaries restrict rT3 testing to these rare indications [^c174a94b] [^cb12e454].

> Next, I should review whether combination T4/T3 therapy alters the T3:rT3 ratio in a way that would justify targeting a ratio. Let me consider the physiology: rT3 is generated from T4 via type 3 deiodinase and is inactive at T3 receptors, so adding exogenous T3 could theoretically lower the T3:rT3 ratio by increasing T3 while rT3 remains unchanged, but wait, I should verify whether trials actually measured this ratio as an outcome. The randomized trials of LT4/LT3 combinations generally did not evaluate T3:rT3 ratios as endpoints; they focused on symptoms, quality of life, and TSH, with mixed and largely neutral results, and when T3 was added, TSH often fell and T3 rose without a defined ratio target being used or validated [^68508bc1] [^3ae009a9] [^e2377670]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating this; indeed, no guideline endorses titrating therapy to a specific T3:rT3 ratio, reinforcing that there is no established optimal value for clinical use [^c174a94b] [^cb12e454].

> I will now examine the practical clinical implications so I don't miss a nuance. In routine hypothyroidism care, TSH-guided LT4 titration remains the standard, with FT4 and occasionally TT3 used selectively for specific scenarios; rT3 is not part of routine monitoring, and there is no validated T3:rT3 therapeutic window to aim for in treated patients [^32fb5434] [^c174a94b]. But wait, what if a patient has persistent symptoms on LT4 with normal TSH; could T3:rT3 help here? The evidence base does not support using T3:rT3 to select or titrate combination therapy, and guidelines advise caution, emphasizing that any trial of LT4/LT3 should be individualized, time-limited, and coordinated carefully due to potential overtreatment risks and lack of consistent benefit [^9f82f68e] [^9f82f68e].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. There is no established optimal T3:rT3 ratio for patients with hypothyroidism, and no professional guideline endorses targeting a specific T3:rT3 value to guide therapy. Routine measurement of rT3 or calculation of T3:rT3 is not recommended outside rare diagnostic contexts, and combination T4/T3 trials have not validated a ratio-based treatment target. Therefore, management should continue to be TSH-centered, with judicious use of FT4 and TT3 when clinically indicated, and any consideration of LT4/LT3 combination should be framed as an individualized, evidence-limited trial rather than ratio-driven therapy [^c174a94b] [^cb12e454] [^32fb5434] [^68508bc1].

There is **no established optimal T3:rT3 ratio** for hypothyroidism management [^c174a94b]. Reverse T3 is an inactive metabolite [^c174a94b] and is not recommended for routine monitoring or therapy adjustment in hypothyroidism [^cb12e454]. Current guidelines prioritize **TSH normalization** with levothyroxine as standard care [^32fb5434], reserving combination T4/T3 therapy for select refractory cases [^45c42bfb] and not targeting any specific T3:rT3 ratio [^c174a94b]. The T3:rT3 ratio may be elevated in non-thyroidal illness [^c174a94b] and is not a reliable marker of tissue euthyroidism or treatment adequacy [^c174a94b].

---

## Physiological role of T3 and rT3

T3 is the **active thyroid hormone** that regulates metabolism, growth, and development, while rT3 is an inactive metabolite of T4 that does not bind T3 receptors or exert significant metabolic effects [^c174a94b]. Under normal conditions, rT3 is produced in small amounts, but its production increases during stress, illness, or caloric restriction — states collectively known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) [^c174a94b].

---

## Clinical significance of T3:rT3 ratio

The T3:rT3 ratio is sometimes discussed in the context of NTIS, where elevated rT3 and decreased T3 levels result in a lower T3:rT3 ratio [^c174a94b]. This alteration is thought to reflect reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and increased conversion of T4 to rT3, contributing to the characteristic low T3 state observed in NTIS [^c174a94b]. However, the clinical utility of the T3:rT3 ratio in hypothyroidism management remains limited and controversial [^c174a94b].

---

## Evidence and guidelines regarding T3:rT3 ratio in hypothyroidism

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently emphasize that there is **no established optimal T3:rT3 ratio** for managing hypothyroidism [^c174a94b]. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and other professional organizations recommend against routine measurement of rT3 or calculation of the T3:rT3 ratio in hypothyroid patients, citing limited clinical utility and lack of evidence supporting its use in guiding therapy [^c174a94b] [^cb12e454].

---

## Clinical utility and limitations of T3:rT3 ratio measurement

While the T3:rT3 ratio may provide insights into thyroid hormone metabolism in specific clinical scenarios, such as NTIS, its utility in hypothyroidism management is limited by several factors:

- **Lack of standardization**: There is no standardized assay or reference range for the T3:rT3 ratio, making interpretation challenging [^c174a94b].

- **Limited clinical evidence**: There is insufficient evidence linking the T3:rT3 ratio to clinical outcomes or treatment response in hypothyroidism [^c174a94b].

- **Alternative biomarkers**: TSH and free T4 remain the primary biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring hypothyroidism, with T3 measurement reserved for specific clinical scenarios [^fe61ed3c].

---

## Current clinical practice and recommendations

In current clinical practice, the management of hypothyroidism primarily relies on **TSH normalization** through levothyroxine (T4) replacement therapy [^32fb5434]. Combination therapy with T4 and T3 may be considered in select patients who remain symptomatic despite normalized TSH levels, but this approach remains controversial and is not guided by specific T3:rT3 ratio targets [^45c42bfb] [^68508bc7].

---

## Conclusion and future directions

In summary, there is **no established optimal T3:rT3 ratio** for hypothyroidism management [^c174a94b]. Current guidelines recommend against routine measurement of rT3 or calculation of the T3:rT3 ratio, emphasizing instead the use of TSH and free T4 for diagnosis and monitoring [^c174a94b]. Future research may clarify the role of T3:rT3 ratio in specific clinical scenarios, but at present, its utility in hypothyroidism management remains limited [^c174a94b].

Reverse T3 Measurements

Unlike the active T4 metabolite T3, rT3 is an inactive metabolite of T4 as it does not bind or compete with T3 at the T3 receptor. Measurement of rT3 is widely cited in the lay press as a potential marker to guide T4 or T3 therapy, however, there is currently no evidence to support this application. Serum rT3 typically rises as T3 falls during nonthyroidal illness; consequently, measurement of rT3 adds little to this diagnosis unless nonthyroidal illness is confounding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.

However, as rT3 assays are not widely available, measurement of T3 is more practical, cheaper, and as effective as measuring rT3 if nonthyroidal illness syndrome is suspected. Other current uses of rT3 analysis and the calculation of the serum rT3/T3 ratio are confined to the diagnosis of rare genetic thyroid conditions, and the diagnosis of the rare consumptive hypothyroidism syndrome due to the overexpression of deiodinase enzyme 3. Except for these three uncommon situations, there is no need to measure rT3 in routine clinical practice.

Triiodothyronine monotherapy for hypothyroidism — The guideline states that "longer-term controlled clinical trials using a longer-acting form of triiodothyronine are needed before considering the endorsement of synthetic liothyronine therapy for routine clinical use" and rates this as "Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". While "thrice-daily synthetic liothyronine may be associated with beneficial effects on parameters such as weight and lipids", pharmacologic considerations include that "multiple daily dosing is required to sustain serum T3 levels given the much shorter half-life of LT3, compared with LT4" and reported "half-life values ranging from 6 to 22 hours". Experimental data further indicate that "normalization of serum TSH and hypothalamic TRH expression with T3 monotherapy requires serum T3 levels in the supranormal range".

### Combination treatment with T4 and T3: toward personalized replacement therapy in hypothyroidism? [^8dc1acba]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Levothyroxine therapy is the traditional lifelong replacement therapy for hypothyroid patients. Over the last several years, new evidence has led clinicians to evaluate the option of combined T(3) and T(4) treatment to improve the quality of life, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action in hypothyroidism. The aim of this review is to assess the physiological basis and the results of current studies on this topic.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms: hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid, guidelines, treatment, deiodinases, clinical symptoms, quality of life, cognition, mood, depression, body weight, heart rate, cholesterol, bone markers, SHBG, and patient preference for combined therapy. The search was restricted to reports published in English since 1970, but some reports published before 1970 were also incorporated. We supplemented the search with records from personal files and references of relevant articles and textbooks. Parameters analyzed included the rationale for combination treatment, the type of patients to be selected, the optimal T(4)/T(3) ratio, and the potential benefits of this therapy on symptoms of hypothyroidism, quality of life, mood, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action.

Evidence Synthesis

The outcome of our analysis suggests that it may be time to consider a personalized regimen of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients.

Conclusions

Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to clarify this important issue. Innovative formulations of the thyroid hormones will be required to mimic a more perfect thyroid hormone replacement therapy than is currently available.

T4, TOTAL, OR FREE TH ANALYSIS?

T4 is the prime TH that is measured. T4 is the main hormone exclusively produced and secreted by the thyroid gland (T4 to T3 ratio in thyroglobulin is ∼10:1). The majority of T3 (∼80%) is generated in extrathyroidal tissues by the two 5′-deiodination enzymes and thus subject to various (patho-) physiological influences, Circulating TH concentrations are affected by the concentration of serum TH binding proteins (TBG, transthyretin, albumin) as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

For this reason, the free hormone hypothesis states that the unbound or free hormone fraction is likely to be a better marker for hormone action since this is the biologically active fraction. This is now widely accepted, at least for serum TH measurements, and serum fT4 should be measured in preference to TT4 despite its very low fraction of TT4 (0.03%).

T4 Metabolites

Although the measurement of T4 metabolites is technically feasible with modern mass spectrometric methods, clinical applications for the measurement of iodothyronine metabolites such as 3-monoiodothyronine (3-T1), 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2), and 3,3′-diiodothyronine (3,3′-T2), and for iodothyroacetic acids such as 3,3′,5-triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac, TA3) and 3,3′,5,5′-acid (Tetrac, TA4) have yet to be established. The potential clinical applications for TH metabolite profiling will require the development of "multiplex" methods wherein the concentration of multiple analytes can be ascertained simultaneously. The focus of this section will be on the measurement of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3).

### Triiodothyronine… [^9441ee00]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Triiodothyronine is normally present in human serum, two thirds being a secretory product of thyroid gland and the remaining one third being derived from extrathyroid conversion of thyroxine to T3. Serum T3 determination has become an important factor in the investigation of thyroid physiology and is now available to the clinician in the diagnosis and management of various thyroid disorders. In general, thyrotropinstimulating hormone or thyroxine levels are better diagnostic indexes of hypothyroidism, while T3 determination is a useful index of thyroid hyperfunction. Gharib H.

### Critical approach to hypothyroid patients with persistent symptoms [^b706f1e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition, and numerous studies have been published over the last decade to assess the potential risks associated with this disorder when inappropriately treated. The standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism remains levothyroxine (LT4) at doses to achieve biochemical and clinical euthyroidism. However, about 15% of hypothyroid patients experience residual hypothyroid symptoms. Some population-based studies and international population-based surveys have confirmed dissatisfaction with LT4 treatment in some hypothyroid patients. It is well established that hypothyroid patients treated with LT4 exhibit higher serum thyroxine:triiodothyronine ratios and can have a persistent increase in cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, variants in deiodinases and thyroid hormone transporter genes have been associated with subnormal T3 concentrations, persistent symptoms in LT4-treated patients, and improvement in response to the addition of liothyronine to LT4 therapy. The American (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines have recently evolved in their recognition of the potential limitations of LT4. This shift is reflected in prescribing patterns: Physicians' use of combination therapy is prevalent and possibly increasing. Randomized clinical trials have recently been published and, while they have found no improvement in treating hypothyroid patients, a number of important limitations did not allow generalizability. Meta-analyses have reported a preference rate for combination therapy in 46.2% hypothyroid patients treated with LT4. To promote discussions about an optimal study design, the ATA, ETA, and British Thyroid Association have recently published a consensus document. Our study provides a useful counterpoint on the controversial benefits of treating hypothyroid patients with combination therapy.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

T4 measurement — free versus total: T4 is the main hormone exclusively produced and secreted by the thyroid gland (T4 to T3 ratio in thyroglobulin is ∼10:1), while the majority of T3 (∼80%) is generated in extrathyroidal tissues. Circulating TH concentrations are affected by serum TH binding proteins, and serum fT4 should be measured in preference to T4 despite its very low fraction of T4 (0.03%).

Combination therapy for patients unwell on levothyroxine — For patients with primary hypothyroidism who feel unwell on levothyroxine therapy alone (in the absence of an allergy to levothyroxine constituents or an abnormal serum thyrotropin), there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of a trial of a combination of levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy outside a formal clinical trial or N-of-1 trial, due to uncertainty in long-term risk benefit ratio of the treatment and uncertainty as to the optimal definition of a successful trial to guide clinical decision-making. The guideline rates this as 'Weak recommendation. Moderate quality evidence'. Additional research targeting those with relatively low serum triiodothyronine concentrations, but normal thyrotropin levels during monotherapy is needed to address whether there is a subgroup of patients who might benefit from combination therapy.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^fe61ed3c]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations — clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

Regarding specific circumstances for thyroid hormone resistance, more specifically with respect to patients with iodothyronine deiodinase defects, ETA 2024 guidelines recommend to document raised serum reverse T3 concentrations and an elevated reverse T3-to-reverse T3 ratio first when considering a diagnosis of a D1 defect, in the absence of non-thyroidal illness.

Mechanistic background — serum triiodothyronine (T3) homeostasis and tissue sourcing: Plasma T3 is the main, and perhaps the only, source of T3 for tissues that lack D2, and even in D2‑expressing tissues approximately 50% of intracellular T3 is estimated to originate from plasma; thus, if plasma T3 falls to low levels, thyroid hormone signaling would be expected to decrease systemically, although the minimum serum concentration that produces biologically important effects remains to be determined. Extrapolating rodent data to humans has a caveat because rats are skewed toward T3 with a ratio of about 6:1 compared with 14:1 in humans.

### Individualized therapy for hypothyroidism: is T4 enough for everyone? [^0ddd5cd0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

It is well recognized that some hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine (LT4) remain symptomatic, but why patients are susceptible to this condition, why symptoms persist, and what is the role of combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), are questions that remain unclear. Here we explore evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism in LT4-treated patients, and offer a rationale for why some patients perceive LT4 therapy as a failure.

Evidence Acquisition

This review is based on a collection of primary and review literature gathered from a PubMed search of "hypothyroidism", "levothyroxine", "liothyronine", and "desiccated thyroid extract", among other keywords. PubMed searches were supplemented by Google Scholar and the authors' prior knowledge of the subject.

Evidence Synthesis

In most LT4-treated patients, normalization of serum thyrotropin levels results in decreased serum T3/T4 ratio, with relatively lower serum T3 levels; in at least 15% of the cases, serum T3 levels are below normal. These changes can lead to a reduction in TH action, which would explain the slower rate of metabolism and elevated serum cholesterol levels. A small percentage of patients might also experience persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism, with impaired cognition and tiredness. We propose that such patients carry a key clinical factor, for example, specific genetic and/or immunologic makeup, that is well compensated while the thyroid function is normal but might become apparent when compounded with relatively lower serum T3 levels.

Conclusions

After excluding other explanations, physicians should openly discuss and consider therapy with LT4 and LT3 with those hypothyroid patients who have persistent symptoms or metabolic abnormalities despite normalization of serum thyrotropin level. New clinical trials focused on symptomatic patients, genetic makeup, and comorbidities, with the statistical power to identify differences between monotherapy and combination therapy, are needed.

Hypothyroidism treatment — future research priorities include strategies to avoid iatrogenic thyroid disease in treated individuals and to aid compliance with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, and a better understanding of maternal-fetal physiology during pregnancy with development of improved titration of LT4 for hypothyroid pregnant patients. Additional needs are further studies of soft gel LT4 capsules; further study and improved standardization of compounded formulations of LT4 and/or liothyronine (LT3); development of additional biomarkers of euthyroidism, which may supplement the use of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as a biomarker; and improved understanding of how triiodothyronine (T3) levels are affected by age and disease status with reference ranges indexed to age and health status, including clarification of the relative importance of maintaining specific serum T3 concentrations. Research is encouraged into the relationship between serum T3 and T3 concentrations in specific tissues; development of more accurate assays to measure serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total T3, and free thyroxine (FT4); development of a sustained release T3 preparation that can be prospectively tested in clinical trials, e.g., in combination with LT4 in a physiologic ratio of about 14:1; and, if such a preparation is unavailable, studying when, if ever, the use of LT3 would be beneficial in selected patients with apparent decreased T4 to T3 conversion and disproportionately low serum T3 levels. Long-term outcome research using thyroid extracts that includes documentation of the consequences of excursions in serum T3 concentrations, development of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile, and pursuit of research into developing thyroid stem cells as a potential avenue for understanding thyrocyte physiology and as a possible future treatment for hypothyroidism are also identified.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^5813fa7a]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: joint British thyroid association / society for endocrinology consensus statement [^9f82f68e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^5ceaf58d]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine targeting of triiodothyronine or thyrotropin levels: There is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with levothyroxine be targeted to achieve low-normal thyrotropin values or high-normal triiodothyronine values in patients with hypothyroidism who are overweight, those who have depression or dyslipidemia, or those who are athyreotic. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Supporting data include a 1-year study in which hypothyroid patients maintained low-normal or high-normal triiodothyronine (T3) had resultant T3 levels of 123 and 113 ng/dL with no decrement in cholesterol, BMI, or percentage body fat associated with the higher LT4, and a cross-over trial of 56 patients with primary hypothyroidism treated for 8-week periods with three doses of LT4 that achieved TSH values of 2.8, 1, and 0.3 mIU/L and free T3 values of 2.5, 2.7, and 3.1 pg/mL, in which psychologic well-being, treatment satisfaction, and body weight did not change across the three different groups; although there was progressive lowering of total cholesterol with higher free T3 values, the significance of this reduction seemed to be due to lowering of cholesterol in the group that included many long-term patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and retrospective data found no significant weight changes after LT4 replacement or suppressive doses in postsurgical hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^b8cfe5d7]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^811151cf]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

PREFACE

This document aims to provide a state-of-the-art status report on the progress achieved in thyroid testing, including thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). The target audience for this document includes general practitioners, endocrinologists, and laboratory professionals. It is not a systematic review or a guidance document addressing currently encountered diagnostic and clinical challenges related to these three key parameters of thyroid testing (Box 1). It does not cover the use of thyroid antibodies for investigating the etiology of thyroid dysfunction, or the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer or the investigation of primary congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

Box 1.
Key Clinical Points for Interpreting Thyroid Tests

Clinically relevant aspects of thyroid pathophysiology and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral axis have recently been reviewed elsewhere. Generic abbreviations for thyroid hormones (THs), T4 and T3, are used in this text, if both total and free TH are meant. Total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) are used for total and free T4 (fT4) or free T3 (fT3) for free TH concentrations, respectively.

### Thyroid and aging [^65be08ee]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Review physiologic thyroid function changes with aging and emphasize careful interpretation of tests in the aging population.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

Using age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges should minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve with time, so careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

Conclusion

Clinical judgement is always warranted to decide how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

Abbreviations

FT4 = free thyroxine; rT3 = reverse triiodothyronine; T3 = triiodothyronine; T4 = thyroxine; TFT = thyroid function test; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.

### Measurement of reverse triiodothyronine level and the triiodothyronine to reverse triiodothyronine ratio in dried blood spot samples at birth may facilitate early detection of monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency [^2249df66]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Currently, most neonatal screening programs are based on measurement of TSH only in DBS samples and, therefore, have not detected newborns with MCT8 deficiency. Programs that also measure T4, total or free, have picked up the low concentration in some newborns with MCT8 deficiency. This led in some instances to treatment with physiological doses of levothyroxine, with no beneficial effects. In fact 6 and 4 of 8 DBS samples from newborns with MCT8 deficiency had total T4 values that were 1 and 2 SDs, respectively, below the mean value. In another report of 8 MCT8-deficient newborn, the mean total T4 was 5.1 ± 1.6 μg/dL with a range of 3.1–8.4, compared with a reference range of 6–15 μg/dL.

Serum TH tests abnormalities in older infants, children, and adults with MCT8 deficiency are typical if not fully pathognomonic. However, it could not be construed that this will also be the case in the first few days of life, given their immature livers, and the contribution of other tissues to the metabolism of TH affecting serum TH concentrations. Based on studies in adult mice with Mct8 deficiency, serum T4 is low due to the combination of reduced secretion from the thyroid gland, increased consumptive degradation by deiodinase 1, and increased excretion in urine. Serum T3 is increased owing to the increased conversion of T4 to T3 by deiodinases 1, its decreased degradation by low deiodinase 3 activity, and, to some extent, reduced transport into tissues. The high deiodinase 1 and low deiodinase 3 activity contribute to the markedly reduced rT3. While Mct8-deficient mice manifest the same abnormalities as humans during adulthood, this is not the case in the early postnatal life. Postpartum low rT3 is the first to manifest, followed by low T4, high TSH, and only then high T3. However, in humans with MCT8 deficiency, the TH abnormalities during the first few days of life remained unknown until this study. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to determine the nature of iodothyronine abnormalities in the 1st week of life. Should MCT8-deficient newborns present characteristic TH abnormalities similar to those found in later life, they could be applied to possibly detect MCT8 deficiency. A future screening program using such tests would enable the determination of the prevalence of this defect.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^4bde2cf9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 The upper-end normal range is from 4. 0 to
4. 5 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 FT 4 level is used to distinguish clinical from subclinical hypothyroidism. Routinely evaluating total T 3, total T 4, or FT 3 levels is not indicated. 30 Thyroid hormone has known inotropic effects on cardiac tissue and can increase myocardial oxygen demand. For older patients or those with coronary artery disease, levothyroxine therapy should be started at 25 to 50 mcg per day, with titration of 25 mcg every three to four weeks until a target dosage is achieved to decrease the potential for adverse effects from thyroid excess. Adding T 3 to levothyroxine does not additionally alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism.

A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials found no difference in symptoms or quality of life in patients treated with levothyroxine monotherapy vs. levothyroxine plus combination therapy. 32 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists does not recommend desiccated thyroid hormone and finds insufficient evidence to recommend combination levothyroxine/T 3 therapy over levothyroxine monotherapy. 3, or both. 25 Levothyroxine should be given as a slow intravenous bolus of 200 to 400 mcg initially, followed by 50 to 100 mcg orally per day. Reduce dosing by 75% if it is being administered intravenously. For combination treatment, T 3 is given at the same time as levothyroxine and dosed at 5 to 20 mcg, then 2. 5 to 10 mcg every eight hours until clinical improvement. Lower dosages are appropriate in older adults and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^74252fa7]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Does reverse triiodothyronine testing have clinical utility? An analysis of practice variation based on order data from a national reference laboratory [^c8b444a9]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical laboratories are under pressure to increase value by improving test utilization. The clinical utility of reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) is controversial. A study was conducted to identify order patterns that might suggest inappropriate utilization of rT3.

Methods

All orders for thyroid tests placed over a period of one year at a national reference laboratory were reviewed. Order patterns by client (hospital) and by provider were analyzed. A Pareto analysis was conducted to determine the percentage of orders placed as a function of the percentage of providers. A systematic review of the indexed literature and an informal review of the web were conducted to identify indications for rT3 testing.

Results

There were 402,386 orders for 447,664 thyroid tests, including 91,767 orders for rT3. These orders were placed by 60,733 providers located at 1139 different organizations. Only 20% of providers who ordered thyroid tests placed an order for rT3. Of those who placed an order for rT3, 95% placed two orders or fewer for rT3. One hundred providers (0.1% of the 60,733 providers who placed orders for thyroid tests) accounted for 29.5% of the orders for rT3. Of the 100 providers, 60 with the highest order volumes for rT3 were classified as practitioners of functional medicine. A systematic review of Medline found little evidence to support the high volumes of orders for rT3. A survey of Web sites for functional medicine suggests that rT3 is useful for the diagnosis of rT3 dominance and can be used to direct triiodothyronine replacement therapy.

Conclusions

There is wide practice variation in rT3 testing. A high proportion of tests are ordered by a relatively small proportion of providers. There is little evidence to support high volumes of rT3 testing placed by some practitioners.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

Thyroid hormone status discordance between pituitary and peripheral tissues — There are specific instances in which there appears to be discordance between the thyroid status of the pituitary gland, as reflected by serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the status of other tissues indicated by biomarkers, and the clinical significance is not known. Mechanistic data indicate tissues can have variable tissue-specific thyroid status and that normalization of TSH does not ensure uniform triiodothyronine (T3) levels across tissues; animal and in vitro/rodent studies show primary changes in type 2 or type 3 deiodinase (D2 or D3) within a tissue can alter thyroid status without affecting circulating T3, thyroxine (T4), or TSH, with reports of relatively T3-deficient tissues despite the same plasma T3 and T4 and sometimes normal serum TSH; human studies have not been reported.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^9b0ebfbb]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Unnecessary levothyroxine treatment of subclinical disease may lead to increased fractures and cardiac arrhythmias. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2.

5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^aa4edc81]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) with its expertise support the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care. Summary: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g., mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical-laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements. Conclusions: Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

### Replacement therapy with levothyroxine plus triiodothyronine (bioavailable molar ratio 14: 1) is not superior to thyroxine alone to improve well-being and cognitive performance in hypothyroidism [^90fd768c]. Clinical Endocrinology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is evidence from recent controlled clinical studies that replacement therapy of hypothyroidism with T4 in combination with a small amount of T3 may improve the well-being of the patients. As the issue is still the subject of controversial discussion, our study was assigned to confirm the superiority of a physiological combination of thyroid hormones (absorbed molar ratio 14: 1) over T4 alone with regard to mood states and cognitive functioning.

Design and Patients

After a run-in period with the T4 study medication for 4 weeks, a controlled, randomized, double-blind, two-period (each 12 weeks), cross-over study without washout between the treatment periods was performed in 23 hypothyroid patients (three males, 20 females, age 23–69 years, 21 subjects after surgery/radioiodine, two with autoimmune thyroiditis) to compare the effects of the previous individual T4 dose (100–175 micro g) with a treatment in which 5% of the respective T4 dose was substituted by T3.

Measurements

Standard hormonal characteristics and standardized psychological tests to quantify mood and cognitive performance were measured after the run-in period and at the end of each treatment period. In 12 subjects, the concentration-time profiles of fT3 and fT4 were compared after the last administration of the respective study medication. TSH, fT3 and fT4 were measured with immunological assays.

Clinical Results

Replacement therapy with T4 and T4/T3 was not different in all steady-state hormonal, metabolic and cardiovascular characteristics except for TSH, which was more suppressed after T4/T3. The efficacy of replacement therapy with the T4/T3 combination was not different from the T4 monotherapy with regard to all psychological test scores describing mood and cognitive functioning of the patients. Mood was even significantly impaired by the T4/T3 combination in eight subjects, with TSH < 0.02 mU/l, compared to patients with normal TSH (Beck Depression Inventory: 8.25 ± 5.01 vs. 4.07 ± 5.60, P = 0.026). PHARMACOKINETIC RESULTS: The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-8h)) of fT3 was significantly higher after T4/T3 compared to the T4 monotherapy (42.8 ± 9.03 pmol x h/l vs. 36.3 ± 8.50 pmol x h/l, P < 0.05) and was significantly correlated to serum TSH (r(s) = -0.609, P < 0.05). After T4/T3, patients with a history of Graves' disease or autoimmune thyroiditis had significantly higher serum trough levels of fT3 whereas the fT4 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with a nonautoimmune background.

Conclusion

Replacement therapy of hypothyroidism with T4 plus T3 does not improve mood and cognitive performance compared to the standard T4 monotherapy. There is even a higher risk of signs of subclinical hyperthyroidism associated with impaired well-being of the patients, which is clearly caused by significant fluctuations in the steady-state fT3 serum concentrations.

### Liothyronine and desiccated thyroid extract in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^e288d900]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The basis for the treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (LT4) is that humans activate T4 to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus, while normalizing serum thyrotropin (TSH), LT4 doses should also restore the body's reservoir of T3. However, there is evidence that T3 is not fully restored in LT4-treated patients. Summary: For patients who remain symptomatic on LT4 therapy, clinical guidelines recommend, on a trial basis, therapy with LT4+LT3. Reducing the LT4 dose by 25 mcg/day and adding 2.5–7.5 mcg liothyronine (LT3) once or twice a day is an appropriate starting point. Transient episodes of hypertriiodothyroninemia with these doses of LT4 and LT3 are unlikely to go above the reference range and have not been associated with adverse drug reactions. Trials following almost a 1000 patients for almost 1 year indicate that similar to LT4, therapy with LT4+LT3 can restore euthyroidism while maintaining a normal serum TSH. An observational study of 400 patients with a mean follow-up of ∼9 years did not indicate increased mortality or morbidity risk due to cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, or fractures after adjusting for age when compared with patients taking only LT4. Desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) is a form of combination therapy in which the LT4/LT3 ratio is ∼4:1; the mean daily dose of DTE needed to normalize serum TSH contains ∼11 mcg T3, but some patients may require higher doses. The DTE remains outside formal FDA oversight, and consistency of T4 and T3 contents is monitored by the manufacturers only. Conclusions: Newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients should be treated with LT4. A trial of combination therapy with LT4+LT3 can be considered for those patients who have unambiguously not benefited from LT4.

T3 Measurement

T3 is predominantly protein bound (99.7%) and a direct measurement of fT3 is theoretically a better marker of thyroid function than TT3. However, the concentration of T3 in the circulation is lower than that of T4, and the binding affinity of T3 to carrier proteins in serum is weaker than that of T4. Consequently, fT3 measurements are more susceptible to interference by free fatty acids and drugs present in the circulation. As a result, the precision and reproducibility of fT3 immunoassays are less than that for fT4.

Consequently, many laboratories prefer to run TT3 assays rather than fT3 due to these concerns regarding fT3 immunoassay reliability. As T3 concentration can often be maintained within the reference interval in hypothyroidism, T3 measurement in patients with suspected hypothyroidism or with increased TSH is of limited clinical value. In hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4. Consequently, the analysis of T3 can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH.

The deiodinase enzymes 1 and 2 are responsible for the conversion of T4 to T3 and most of the T3 in circulation. The activity of these enzymes can be altered in patients with intercurrent illness, resulting in the low T3 concentrations that are characteristic of the nonthyroidal illness syndrome. Occasionally modification of the activity of deiodinase enzymes 1, 2, and 3 in patients on T4 replacement can also result in lower levels of circulating T3. In addition, circulating T3 can be reduced by increased activity of deiodinase enzyme 3 that can metabolize both T3 and T4.

As a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark of nonthyroidal illness, measurement of T3 is unlikely to be of diagnostic relevance in this context. However, T3 measurement can be useful in some clinical situations such as patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease. Here T3 measurement may help distinguish between hyperthyroidism and the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or to identify the coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness (Box 3).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^318324c9]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Thyroid hormone replacement therapy in primary hypothyroidism: a randomized trial comparing L-thyroxine plus liothyronine with L-thyroxine alone [^3ae009a9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Substituting part of the dose of l-thyroxine with small but supraphysiologic doses of liothyronine in hypothyroid patients has yielded conflicting results.

Objective

To evaluate combinations of L-thyroxine plus liothyronine in hypothyroid patients that match the proportions present in normal secretions of the human thyroid gland.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.

Setting

Academic research hospital.

Participants

28 women with overt primary hypothyroidism.

Intervention

Crossover trial comparing treatment with l-thyroxine, 100 microg/d (standard treatment), versus treatment with L-thyroxine, 75 microg/d, plus liothyronine, 5 microg/d (combination treatment), for 8-week periods. All patients also received L-thyroxine, 87.5 microg/d, plus liothyronine, 7.5 microg/d (add-on combination treatment), for a final 8-week add-on period.

Measurements

Primary outcomes included serum thyroid hormone levels, results of quality-of-life and psychometric tests, and patients' preference. Multiple biological thyroid hormone end points were studied as secondary outcomes.

Results

Compared with standard treatment, combination treatment led to lower free thyroxine levels (decrease, 3.9 pmol/L [95% CI, 2.5 to 5.3 pmol/L]), slightly higher serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (increase, 0.62 mU/L [CI, 0.01 to 1.23 mU/L]), and unchanged free triiodothyronine levels. No improvement was observed in the other primary and secondary end points after combination treatment, with the exception of the Digit Span Test, in which the mean backward score and the mean total score increased slightly (0.6 digit [CI, 0.1 to 1.0 digit] and 0.8 digit [CI, 0.2 to 1.4 digits], respectively). The add-on combination treatment resulted in overreplacement. Levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone decreased by 0.85 mU/L (CI, 0.27 to 1.43 mU/L) and serum free triiodothyronine levels increased by 0.8 pmol/L (CI, 0.1 to 1.5 pmol/L) compared with standard treatment; 10 patients had levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone that were below the normal range. Twelve patients preferred combination treatment, 6 patients preferred the add-on combination treatment, 2 patients preferred standard treatment, and 6 patients had no preference (P = 0.015).

Limitations

Treatment with L-thyroxine, 87.5 microg/d, plus liothyronine, 7.5 microg/d, was an add-on regimen and was not randomized.

Conclusions

Physiologic combinations of L-thyroxine plus liothyronine do not offer any objective advantage over l-thyroxine alone, yet patients prefer combination treatment.

### Shared decisionmaking in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^8b7e4507]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and metabolic slowdowns. It is most prevalent in women and older adults, with causes including autoimmune thyroiditis, surgical thyroidectomy, and certain medications.

Standard Of Care and Limitations

The standard treatment involves synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which alleviates symptoms by converting to the active hormone, T3. However, some patients continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and poor quality of life despite normalized TSH levels. This persistence of symptoms may stem from misdiagnosis, inadequate dosing, or incomplete normalization of thyroid hormone signaling.

New Findings

Research suggests that LT4 monotherapy may not fully restore T3 levels, leading to suboptimal symptom control. Consequently, combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) has been proposed as an alternative, aiming to balance T4 and T3 levels more effectively. Although randomized controlled trials have not identified significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between LT4 monotherapy and combination therapy, they indicate that patients may prefer the latter.

Conclusion

Guidelines from leading endocrinology organizations now recommend considering combination therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate LT4 dosing. A patient-centered approach, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized treatment plans, is essential for optimizing outcomes in hypothyroidism management. Further research is needed to refine dosing strategies and identify the patients who would benefit most from combination therapy.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

### Does a combination regimen of thyroxine (T4) and 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine improve depressive symptoms better than T4 alone in patients with hypothyroidism? Results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^02af4523]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Some hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy complain of depressive symptoms despite normal TSH measurements. It is not known whether adding T(3) can reverse such symptoms. We randomized 40 individuals with depressive symptoms who were taking a stable dose of levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism (excluding those who underwent thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid) to receive T(4) plus placebo or the combination of T(4) plus T(3) in a double-blind manner for 15 wk. Participants receiving combination therapy had their prestudy dose of T(4) dropped by 50%, and T(3) was started at a dose of 12.5 micro g, twice daily. T(4) and T(3) doses were adjusted to keep goal TSH concentrations within the normal range. Compared with the group taking T(4) alone, the group taking both T(4) plus T(3) did not report any improvement in self-rated mood and well-being scores that included all subscales of the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screen for Depression, and the Multiple Outcome Study (P > 0.05 for all indexes). In conclusion, the current data do not support the routine use of combined T(3) and T(4) therapy in hypothyroid patients with depressive symptoms.

Introduction

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby the patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells and 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in LT4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in LT4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with LT4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidectomized rats with evident tissue hypothyroidism in peripheral cells, tissue euthyroidism occurred only following normalization of serum T3.

The above-mentioned evidence led to the growing interest in combination therapy with LT4 plus liothyronine(LT3); however, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials addressing objective and subjective clinical outcomes did not provide conclusive results. The non-conclusive results, besides heterogeneity in the study population, design, and dosage, may be attributed to the concerns and challenges regarding available oral T3 preparations stemming from the short half-life of T3 with rapid T3 absorption followed by fast metabolization. Despite the lack of definite evidence for the superiority of combination therapy, this strategy remains a common practice in hypothyroid patients who remained dissatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, while the use of LT4 + SR-T3 was suggested.

### Combined therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine in two ratios, compared with levothyroxine monotherapy in primary hypothyroidism: a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial [^e2377670]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Controversy remains about the value of combined treatment with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3), compared with LT4 alone in primary hypothyroidism. We compared combined treatment with LT4 and LT3 in a ratio of 5:1 or 10:1 with LT4 monotherapy. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 141 patients (18–70 yr old) with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism, recruited via general practitioners. Inclusion criteria included: LT4 treatment for 6 months or more, a stable dose for 6 wk or more, and serum TSH levels between 0.11 and 4.0 microU/ml (mU/liter). Randomization groups were: 1) continuation of LT4 (n = 48); 2) LT4/LT3, ratio 10:1 (n = 46); and 3) LT4/LT3, ratio 5:1 (n = 47). Subjective preference of study medication after 15 wk, compared with usual LT4, was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included scores on questionnaires on mood, fatigue, psychological symptoms, and a substantial set of neurocognitive tests. Study medication was preferred to usual treatment by 29.2, 41.3, and 52.2% in the LT4, 10:1 ratio, and 5:1 ratio groups, respectively (chi2 test for trend, P = 0.024). This linear trend was not substantiated by results on any of the secondary outcome measures: scores on questionnaires and neurocognitive tests consistently ameliorated, but the amelioration was not different among the treatment groups. Median end point serum TSH was 0.64 microU/ml (mU/liter), 0.35 microU/ml (mU/liter), and 0.07 microU/ml (mU/liter), respectively [ANOVA on ln(TSH) for linear trend, P < 0.01]. Mean body weight change was +0.1, -0.5, and -1.7 kg, respectively (ANOVA for trend, P = 0.01). Decrease in weight, but not decrease in serum TSH was correlated with increased satisfaction with study medication. Of the patients who preferred combined LT4/LT3 therapy, 44% had serum TSH less than 0.11 microU/ml (mU/liter). Patients preferred combined LT4/LT3 therapy to usual LT4 therapy, but changes in mood, fatigue, well-being, and neurocognitive functions could not satisfactorily explain why the primary outcome was in favor of LT4/LT3 combination therapy. Decrease in body weight was associated with satisfaction with study medication.

### Pharmacokinetics of L-triiodothyronine in patients undergoing thyroid hormone therapy withdrawal [^7974d2c5]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: L-triiodothyronine (LT3) is a substitute for levothyroxine (LT4) for thyroid cancer (TC) patients during the preparation for nuclear medicine procedures, and it is used in combination with LT4 in patients who do not respond to the standard treatment for hypothyroidism. This therapy is commonly done by using fixed doses, potentially resulting in supraphysiologic levels of triiodothyronine (T3). A good understanding of the LT3 pharmacokinetics (PK) is necessary to design combination treatment schemes that are able to maintain serum T3 levels within the reference range, but data on the PK of LT3 are conflicting. Here, we present a study designed to characterize the PK of LT3 in patients devoid of endogenous thyroid hormone production, and not receiving LT4 therapy. Methods: We performed an open-label, PK study in patients undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal in preparation for nuclear medicine procedures for the evaluation and treatment of follicular-derived TC. LT3 was substituted for LT4 at a 1:3 mcg/mcg dosage ratio thrice daily for at least 30 days. PK of the last LT3 dose while at steady state and terminal elimination was assessed over 11 days. Thereafter, a PK study was performed following the nuclear medicine procedure in patients who volunteered for a second study. Results: Fourteen patients age 48.5 ± 16.0 years completed the last dose study and five completed the second PK study. PK analysis indicates a time to maximum serum concentration of 1.8 ± 0.32 hours and two distinct phases of linear elimination, with a fast distribution phase and slow elimination phases with half-lives of 2.3 ± 0.11 hours and 22.9 ± 7.7 hours, supporting a two-compartment model. PK modeling predicts that a twice-daily administration of low-dose LT3 (0.07 mcg/kg twice daily) in combination with LT4 can predictably increase the serum T3 concentration without significant peaks above the reference range. Conclusions: The PK of LT3 is well described by a two-compartment model that assumes elimination only from the sampling compartment, with a rapid distribution phase and a slow elimination phase. This information will contribute to design therapeutic strategies for LT3/LT4 combination therapies directed to maintain stable T3 serum levels.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bf75ab49]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroxine (T4) has a half-life of approximately 7 days, serving as a stable, long-acting hormone reservoir for conversion to the more active triiodothyronine (T3), which has a shorter half-life of about 1 day, reflecting its potent and rapid-acting metabolic effects on energy expenditure and thermogenesis; meanwhile, Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) has a half-life of about 60–80 min, allowing for rapid adjustments in response to the body's thyroid hormone needs.

The potential mechanisms underlying the observed effects of combined T4 and T3 therapy, as compared to levothyroxine (T4) alone, involve several complex factors that vary among individuals. This combined therapy aims to more closely mimic the natural secretion of the thyroid gland, potentially restoring physiological levels of T3 and T4 across various tissues. T3, the more active hormone, may enhance metabolic effects in peripheral tissues more directly than T4, a prohormone, thus ameliorating hypothyroid symptoms. Genetic variations in thyroid hormone transport and metabolism, such as those involving deiodinase enzymes, might make certain individuals more responsive to T3 supplementation, particularly those with specific genetic polymorphisms affecting the conversion of T4 to T3. Despite mixed results in clinical trials, patient preference for combined therapy over T4 alone often arises from subjective improvements in symptoms like fatigue and cognitive function, which are not consistently quantifiable by standard clinical parameters. While the evidence remains mixed, and most professional guidelines still recommend T4 monotherapy as the standard treatment, combined therapy may offer benefits to specific patients, particularly those who do not efficiently convert T4 to T3.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism.

Clinical recommendations for hormone administration timing in relation to blood sampling

Regarding L-T3, the use of either standard liothyronine or sustained-release triiodothyronine as monotherapy is not recommended, nor is its combination with L-T4. However, the combination therapy of the two could be considered in compliant L-T4-treated hypothyroid patients who have persistent complaints despite serum TSH values within the reference range, based on the assumption that euthyroidism can be reached simultaneously in all tissues of hypothyroid patients only by L-T4 + L-T3 in a dose ratio that mimics the physiological T4-to-T3 secretion ratio by the human thyroid gland (which is close to 13:1 by weight). If L-T4 can be given once daily, the daily L-T3 dose should be divided –if possible- into 2 doses, one before breakfast and the largest one before sleeping, for a maximum dosage of 60 to 80 µg/day. The rationale for giving L-T3 twice daily (or even more) is the relatively short t 1/2 of L-T3, the peak serum T3 values occurring at 2 to 4 hours after ingestion, and a physiological diurnal variation in serum T3 with the peak around 4and the nadir between 3 and 5.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^04a4a7e0]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

Thyroid hormone analogs and resistance to thyroid hormone — treatment goals and role of analogs are stated as follows: "The therapeutic goals of the treatment of patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone are to improve the symptoms caused by excessive TRα signaling, while minimizing the symptoms caused by deficient TRβ signaling". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. "Although preliminary data from small case series suggest that the use of TRIAC in patients with genetic syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormone may be promising, more clinical research is needed before the use of thyroid hormone analogs can be recommended for this indication". Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Mechanistic background notes that resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare genetic disease with increased serum TSH and inappropriately normal or increased FT4; patients with RTHα have normal TSH with low FT4 and high T3, whereas patients with RTHβ have normal or elevated TSH with elevated FT4 and FT3; most forms are autosomal dominant TRβ mutations, and approximately 1000 patients in 350 families with TRβ mutations have been described.

Obesity and hypothyroidism — weight and diagnostic considerations: Overt hypothyroidism does not appear to be more common in the obese population than in the general population. In a prospective year-long study of newly diagnosed patients with overt hypothyroidism, mean TSH levels at study onset was 102. Caution must therefore be exercised when diagnosing subclinical hypothyroidism in the setting of marked obesity. Supraphysiological doses of thyroid hormone should not be employed as an adjunct to weight loss programs in patients with or without hypothyroidism, and the impact of thyroid hormone therapy on waist-hip ratio and weight loss appears at most to be modest.

### Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists statement-replacement therapy for primary hypothyroidism: a brief guide for clinical practice [^ff65aacc]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism requires life-long thyroid hormone replacement therapy in most patients. Oral levothyroxine (LT4) is an established safe and effective treatment for hypothyroidism, but some issues remain unsettled.

Methods

The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a panel of experts to provide an updated statement for appropriate use of thyroid hormone formulations for hypothyroidism replacement therapy. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines was followed.

Results

LT4 is the first choice in replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be maintained between 1.0 and 3.0 mIU/L in young subjects and at the upper normal limit in elderly or fragile patients. Achievement of biochemical targets, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment should be addressed. In patients with unstable serum TSH, a search for interfering factors and patient compliance is warranted. Liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects with hampered LT4 absorption or who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals and LT4 replacement. Replacement therapy with LT4 and L-triiodothyronine (LT3) combination is generally not recommended. A trial may be considered in patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism only after co-existent nonthyroid problems have been excluded or optimally managed. LT3 should be administered in small (LT4:LT3 ratio, 10:1 to 20:1) divided daily doses. Combined therapy should be avoided in elderly patients or those with cardiac risk factors and in pregnancy.

Conclusion

LT4 therapy should be aimed at resolution of symptoms of hypothyroidism, normalization of serum TSH, and improvement of quality of life. In selected cases, the use of liquid LT4 formulations or combined LT4/LT3 treatment may be considered to improve adherence to treatment or patient well-being.

Mechanistic background on D2 and T4-to-T3 conversion — A fundamental characteristic of D2 is that its enzymatic activity is tightly coupled to plasma T4 levels by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system, and as circulating T4 falls in hypothyroid subjects, the fractional conversion rate of T4-to-T3 increases.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^cc6ebde5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

Combination LT4, LT3 treatment in primary hypothyroidism — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: In adults with primary hypothyroidism, 13 original RCTs were reviewed, with treatment durations ranging from 5 weeks to 1 year and the majority 6 months or shorter; females accounted for 80% or more of participants in specific trials; seven had a cross-over design and the rest a parallel design; all included trials had some level of blinding except for one study. Effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) varied: eight studies found no difference versus LT4 alone, two reported significantly higher TSH with combination therapy, and two reported significantly lower TSH, including suppression to 0.07 mIU/L in a highest dose combination group using a 5:1 ratio of LT4 to LT3. Health-related quality-of-life/mood results across 13 trials were heterogeneous, with two trials showing marked superiority of combination treatment on multiple measures, two showing superiority on a minority of measurements (including improvements at 3 months but not 12 months in one trial), and eight trials showing no statistically significant superiority over LT4.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^b2bf2570]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Thyroxine plus low-dose, slow-release triiodothyronine replacement in hypothyroidism: proof of principle [^91334bf7]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Studies in hypothyroid rats show that, when infused with a combination of thyroxine (T4) plus triiodothyronine (T3) to normalize thyrotropin (TSH), euthyroidism in all organs is only ensured when T(4) and T(3) are administered in a ratio as normally secreted by the rat thyroid. As substitution with T(4)-only results in an abnormal serum T(4)/T(3) ratio, it is also possible that in humans, euthyroidism does not exist at the tissue level in many organs, considering that iodothyronine metabolism in the human and the rat share many similar mechanisms. Recent reports in which cognitive function and well-being are compared in patients with primary hypothyroidism substituted with T(4)-only versus substitution with T(4) plus T(3) result in controversial findings in that either positive or no effects were found. In all these studies T(3) was used in the plain form that results in nonphysiologic serum T(3) peaks. In these studies it is suggested that substitution with T(3)should preferably be performed with a preparation that slowly releases T(3) to avoid these peaks. In the study reported here we show that treatment of hypothyroid subjects with a combination of T(4) plus slow-release T(3) leads to a considerable improvement of serum T(4) and T(3) values, the T(4)/T(3) ratio and serum TSH as compared to treatment with T(4)- only. Serum T(3) administration with slow-release T(3) did not show serum peaks, in contrast to plain T(3).

### Evidence-based use of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism: a consensus document [^2fd05e86]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Fourteen clinical trials have not shown a consistent benefit of combination therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3). Despite the publication of these trials, combination therapy is widely used and patients reporting benefit continue to generate patient and physician interest in this area. Recent scientific developments may provide insight into this inconsistency and guide future studies. Methods: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), British Thyroid Association (BTA), and European Thyroid Association (ETA) held a joint conference on November 3, 2019 (live-streamed between Chicago and London) to review new basic science and clinical evidence regarding combination therapy with presentations and input from 12 content experts. After the presentations, the material was synthesized and used to develop Summary Statements of the current state of knowledge. After review and revision of the material and Summary Statements, there was agreement that there was equipoise for a new clinical trial of combination therapy. Consensus Statements encapsulating the implications of the material discussed with respect to the design of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy were generated. Authors voted upon the Consensus Statements. Iterative changes were made in several rounds of voting and after comments from ATA/BTA/ETA members. Results: Of 34 Consensus Statements available for voting, 28 received at least 75% agreement, with 13 receiving 100% agreement. Those with 100% agreement included studies being powered to study the effect of deiodinase and thyroid hormone transporter polymorphisms on study outcomes, inclusion of patients dissatisfied with their current therapy and requiring at least 1.2μg/kg of LT4 daily, use of twice daily LT3 or preferably a slow-release preparation if available, use of patient-reported outcomes as a primary outcome (measured by a tool with both relevant content validity and responsiveness) and patient preference as a secondary outcome, and utilization of a randomized placebo-controlled adequately powered double-blinded parallel design. The remaining statements are presented as potential additional considerations. Discussion: This article summarizes the areas discussed and presents Consensus Statements to guide development of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy. The results of such redesigned trials are expected to be of benefit to patients and of value to inform future thyroid hormone replacement clinical practice guidelines treatment recommendations.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^32fb5434]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Metabolic effects of liothyronine therapy in hypothyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of liothyronine versus levothyroxine [^c0a028fc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Levothyroxine (L-T(4)) therapy is based on the assumption that the conversion of T(4) into T(3) provides adequate amounts of active hormone at target tissues. However, in rodents, L-T(4) alone does not restore a euthyroid state in all tissues. Previous combination L-T(4)/liothyronine (L-T(3)) therapy trials focused on quality-of-life endpoints, and limited information is available on the effects on other measures of thyroid hormone action.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of thyroid hormone replacement with L-T(4) or L-T(3) at doses producing equivalent normalization of TSH.

Participants, Design, and Setting

Fourteen hypothyroid patients participated in this randomized, double-blind, crossover intervention at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

Interventions

L-T(3) or L-T(4) were administered thrice daily to achieve a target TSH from 0.5–1.5 mU/liter. Volunteers were studied as inpatients after 6 wk on a stable dose and at the target TSH.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum thyroid hormones, lipid parameters, and indices of glucose metabolism were evaluated.

Results

No difference was observed in TSH between L-T(3) and L-T(4) treatments. L-T(3) resulted in significant weight loss [L-T(4), 70.6 ± 12.5, vs. L-T(3), 68.5 ± 11.9 kg (P = 0.009)] and in a 10.9 ± 10.0% decrease in total cholesterol (P = 0.002), 13.3 ± 12.1% decrease in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P = 0.002), and an 18.3 ± 28.6% decrease in apolipoprotein B (P = 0.018). No significant differences were observed in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, heart rate, blood pressure, exercise tolerance, or insulin sensitivity.

Conclusions

The substitution of L-T(3) for L-T(4) at equivalent doses (relative to the pituitary) reduced body weight and resulted in greater thyroid hormone action on the lipid metabolism, without detected differences in cardiovascular function or insulin sensitivity.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^c5379405]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the treatment for hypothyroidism, a historically symptom-orientated approach has given way to reliance on a single biochemical parameter, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

Main body

The historical developments and motivation leading to that decision and its potential implications are explored from pathophysiological, clinical and statistical viewpoints. An increasing frequency of hypothyroid-like complaints is noted in patients in the wake of this directional shift, together with relaxation of treatment targets. Recent prospective and retrospective studies suggested a changing pattern in patient complaints associated with recent guideline-led low-dose policies. A resulting dramatic rise has ensued in patients, expressing in various ways dissatisfaction with the standard treatment. Contributing factors may include raised problem awareness, overlap of thyroid-related complaints with numerous non-specific symptoms, and apparent deficiencies in the diagnostic process itself. Assuming that maintaining TSH anywhere within its broad reference limits may achieve a satisfactory outcome is challenged. The interrelationship between TSH, free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) is patient specific and highly individual. Population-based statistical analysis is therefore subject to amalgamation problems (Simpson's paradox, collider stratification bias). This invalidates group-averaged and range-bound approaches, rather demanding a subject-related statistical approach. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) outcomes may be equally distorted by intra-class clustering. Analytical distinction between an averaged versus typical outcome becomes clinically relevant, because doctors and patients are more interested in the latter. It follows that population-based diagnostic cut-offs for TSH may not be an appropriate treatment target. Studies relating TSH and thyroid hormone concentrations to adverse effects such as osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation invite similar caveats, as measuring TSH within the euthyroid range cannot substitute for FT4 and FT3 concentrations in the risk assessment. Direct markers of thyroid tissue effects and thyroid-specific quality of life instruments are required, but need methodological improvement.

Conclusion

It appears that we are witnessing a consequential historic shift in the treatment of thyroid disease, driven by over-reliance on a single laboratory parameter TSH. The focus on biochemistry rather than patient symptom relief should be re-assessed. A joint consideration together with a more personalized approach may be required to address the recent surge in patient complaint rates.

### Management of primary hypothyroidism: statement by the British thyroid association executive committee [^220cbadb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) is simple, effective and safe, and most patients report improved well-being on initiation of treatment. However, a proportion of individuals continue to suffer with symptoms despite achieving adequate biochemical correction. The management of such individuals has been the subject of controversy and of considerable public interest. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. These guidelines have been based on extensive reviews of the medical literature and include sections on the role of combination therapy with L-T4 and liothyronine (L-T3) in individuals who are persistently dissatisfied with L-T4 therapy. This position statement by the British Thyroid Association (BTA) summarises the key points in these guidelines and makes recommendations on the management of primary hypothyroidism based on the current literature, review of the published positions of the ETA and ATA, and in line with best principles of good medical practice. The statement is endorsed by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry, (ACB), British Thyroid Foundation, (BTF), Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and Society for Endocrinology (SFE).

### Paradigm shifts in thyroid hormone replacement therapies for hypothyroidism [^e66db87d]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Impaired psychological well-being, depression or anxiety are observed in 5–10% of hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine, despite normal TSH levels. Such complaints might hypothetically be related to increased free T₄ and decreased free T₃ serum concentrations, which result in the abnormally low free T₄:free T₃ ratios observed in 30% of patients on levothyroxine. Evidence is mounting that levothyroxine monotherapy cannot assure a euthyroid state in all tissues simultaneously, and that normal serum TSH levels in patients receiving levothyroxine reflect pituitary euthyroidism alone. Levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination therapy is gaining in popularity; although the evidence suggests it is generally not superior to levothyroxine monotherapy, in some of the 14 published trials this combination was definitely preferred by patients and associated with improved metabolic profiles. Disappointing results with combination therapy could be related to use of inappropriate levothyroxine and liothyronine doses, resulting in abnormal serum free T₄:free T₃ ratios. Alternatively, its potential benefit might be confined to patients with specific genetic polymorphisms in thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases that affect the intracellular levels of T₃ available for binding to T₃ receptors. Levothyroxine monotherapy remains the standard treatment for hypothyroidism. However, in selected patients, new guidelines suggest that experimental combination therapy might be considered.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^d2265858]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^370035d4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

### Thyroid hormone replacement for central hypothyroidism: a randomized controlled trial comparing two doses of thyroxine (T4) with a combination of T4 and triiodothyronine [^d7cef9b0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Dosage of T(4) in central hypothyroidism is primarily guided by the free serum T(4) level (fT4). However, the optimum fT4 range is ill defined, and subtle hypothyroidism might be missed using this approach.

Objectives

Our aim was to investigate the effects of a body weight (bw)-adapted T(4) treatment, alone or in combination with T(3), on metabolism, well-being, and cognitive function in comparison to a regimen leading to normal fT4.

Design

This was a placebo-controlled trial (double-blind, crossover).

Patients

A total of 29 patients (age 52 ± 2 yr; females/males, 8/21) with hypopituitarism, including TSH deficiency, participated in the study.

Interventions

Three regimens were compared (5 wk each): "EMPIRICAL-T4", empirical T(4) dosage (1 ± 0.05 microg/kg bw) leading to normal fT4; BW-ADAPTED-T4 (1.6 microg/kg bw T(4)); and "BW-ADAPTED-T3T4", bw-adapted combination of T(3) and T(4) (ratio of 1:10).

Results

BW-ADAPTED-T4 administration increased mean fT4 concentrations to the upper limit of the normal range (peak levels). Compared with EMPIRICAL-T4, BW-ADAPTED-T4 treatment resulted in a lower body mass index (BMI) (29.0 ± 0.7 vs. 29.5 ± 0.7 kg/m(2); P < 0.03), lower total cholesterol (198 ± 9 vs. 226 ± 7 mg/dl; P < 0.01), and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (116 ± 5 vs. 135 ± 7 mg/dl; P < 0.01). BW-ADAPTED-T3T4 treatment was associated with additional beneficial effects on ankle reflex time and working memory but resulted in supraphysiological free serum T(3) (fT(3)) levels.

Limitations

Long-term side effects may have been missed.

Conclusions

Using a dose of 1.6 microg/kg bw improved markers commonly associated with central hypothyroidism. This suggests that T(4) dosage based on bw and aiming at fT4 in the upper reference range is superior to titration of T(4) aiming at middle normal fT4 concentrations in those patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^48e51440]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid hormone tests, AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to measure serum free T4 (free T4 index or free T4 estimate and direct immunoassay of free T4 without physical separation using anti-T4 antibodies) instead of total T4 in the evaluation of hypothyroidism.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TSH MEASUREMENT

Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can in most cases be easily diagnosed based on using TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high quality, sensitive and specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality cost-effective medicine.TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turn-around time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different (Box 2). Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns < 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due the postnatal TSH surge. In newborns between the ages of 3 days and 1 month, serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally considered as a clinical action limit requiring immediate action. At the other age extreme, in the elderly, the upper bound of the TSH reference interval progressively increases with age and should be reflected in laboratory reports and taken into consideration for clinical interpretation of TSH test results.

Box 2.
Points to Consider for Clinical Thyrotropin Measurements

As well as the initial clinical indication for which TSH is measured, other independent variables must be kept in mind when using and interpreting TSH measurements. Human thyroid function is affected by nutritional, environmental, geographical, genetic, and various (patho-)physiological endogenous or exogenous factors. These include population-specific iodine intake, patient age and sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used (see Comparability and Quality Assessment of fT4 and TSH Assays section).

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^23261a7f]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with comorbidities, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to maintain the levothyroxine treatment dose in ICU patients and patients with non-thyroidal illness, regardless of blood test results, as they cannot be interpreted accurately in this context. Apply appropriate dose variation if a change in the route of administration is necessary.
