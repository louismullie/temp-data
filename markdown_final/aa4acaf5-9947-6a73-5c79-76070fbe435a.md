## Question

80. A perfectly smooth sphere, having the same size as the Earth, is encircled by a wire at the equator. This wire was extended by one meter and arranged so that an equal gap was formed between the wire and the surface of the sphere. Would a mouse be able to squeeze through the resulting gap?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a mouse could squeeze through the gap created when a wire around Earth's equator is extended by 1 meter and lifted uniformly above the surface. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry and calculate the uniform gap height. Then, I should verify the mouse's minimum entry size from authoritative sources. Next, I will compare the calculated gap to the mouse's capability and consider practical implications. Finally, I will double-check the math and state a clear conclusion with caveats about real-world conditions.

> Let me first confirm the geometric setup and the key formula. The wire originally sits at Earth's equatorial circumference, so extending it by 1 meter and distributing that extension uniformly around the sphere increases the radius by a small amount. The relationship between circumference and radius is C = 2πr, so a change in circumference ΔC = 2πΔr, which means the radial gap Δr = ΔC / (2π) = 1 m / (2π) ≈ 0.159 m, or about 15.9 cm.

> Wait, let me verify the numerical result before moving on. 1 divided by 2π is approximately 0.159, so the uniform gap is roughly 16 cm. That seems counterintuitive at first glance because Earth's circumference is so large, but the math is correct: a 1-meter increase in circumference translates to a radial lift of about 16 cm regardless of the sphere's size, which is a classic result in geometry puzzles.

> Next, I should review the mouse's minimum entry size. I need to check authoritative guidance on rodent-proofing. The environmental assessment practice parameter states that mice can enter through holes as small as ¼ inch, which is about 6.35 mm, and housing guidance emphasizes sealing even small gaps to prevent ingress, reinforcing that mice can exploit very small openings [^3d869f3e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should compare the calculated gap to the mouse's capability. A 16 cm gap is roughly 160 mm, which is more than 25 times larger than the 6.35 mm minimum entry size for mice. Practically, that means a mouse could not just squeeze through — it could walk through upright without contortion, so the answer is clearly yes, a mouse could fit through the gap.

> I should double-check the practical implication to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. The calculation assumes a perfectly uniform gap and a perfectly smooth sphere; in reality, surface irregularities or nonuniform lifting could create local variations, but even if the gap were uneven, any segment still on the order of centimeters would remain far above the mouse's threshold for entry, so the conclusion stands.

> Final answer: Yes, a mouse could easily squeeze through the resulting gap, because extending the equatorial wire by 1 meter creates a uniform radial gap of about 16 cm, which is much larger than the approximately 6 mm opening mice can traverse.

---

The gap created by extending the equatorial wire by 1 meter is **about 16 cm** (6.3 inches), which is more than enough for a mouse to squeeze through. This result is independent of the sphere's size because the gap depends only on the added length and the geometry of a circle. Mice can fit through openings as small as 6–7 mm, so a 16 cm gap is **easily navigable** [^e65ed728].

---

## Calculation of the gap

Let the Earth's equatorial radius be (R). The original circumference is:

C = 2πR

After adding 1 meter, the new circumference is:

C' = 2πR + 1

The new radius (R') is:

R' = [C'/(2π)] = [(2πR + 1)/(2π)] = R + [1/(2π)]

The gap (h) is the difference in radii:

h = R' − R = [1/(2π)] ≈ 0.159 meters ≈ 15.9 cm

Thus, the gap is **approximately 16 cm** (6.3 inches).

---

## Mouse anatomy and squeezing ability

Mice have highly flexible skeletons and can compress their bodies to fit through very small openings. The **minimum hole size** mice can pass through is about 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 inches) [^e65ed728]. This flexibility allows them to exploit gaps far smaller than their apparent body size.

---

## Comparison of gap size to mouse size

The calculated gap of ~16 cm is **significantly larger** than the ~6–7 mm minimum opening a mouse can traverse. This means a mouse could easily pass through the 16 cm gap without difficulty.

---

## Conclusion

The gap formed by extending the equatorial wire by 1 meter is **about 16 cm**, which is much larger than the smallest opening a mouse can squeeze through. Therefore, **a mouse could easily fit through the gap**.

Introduction

Epiboly is one of the hallmark morphogenetic movements during animal gastrulation. It involves spreading of an epithelial sheet over the spherical or ellipsoidal egg. The sheet eventually forms a continuous layer that entirely surrounds the embryo and the yolk sac. During this morphogenetic event, fundamental geometrical and mechanical problems arise. First, in order to cover the entire egg, the epithelium has to expand in surface area. However, once the egg equator is reached, the expanding tissue must also undergo a regional compaction at its leading edge in order to seal seamlessly at the bottom of the sphere (Fig. 1a). Studies in fish showed that the tissue spreading is mediated by changes in cell shape, cell number, and cell arrangement coupled to constriction of an actomyosin ring in the yolk at the leading edge of the sheet –. However, it remains unclear whether pulling forces at the leading edge expand cells uniformly throughout the tissue and how cells behave at the leading edge that needs to compact. Second, spreading over a sphere induces mechanical stress in the tissue. In zebrafish, mechanical stress during epibolic expansion is released by oriented cell divisions in the tissue. In other epiboly systems however, cell division does not occur, and thus other unknown mechanisms have to alleviate built-up stress.

### Measurement of gravitational coupling between millimetre-sized masses [^a0e464da]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gravity is the weakest of all known fundamental forces and poses some of the most important open questions to modern physics: it remains resistant to unification within the standard model of physics and its underlying concepts appear to be fundamentally disconnected from quantum theory 1–4. Testing gravity at all scales is therefore an important experimental endeavour 5–7. So far, these tests have mainly involved macroscopic masses at the kilogram scale and beyond 8. Here we show gravitational coupling between two gold spheres of 1 millimetre radius, thereby entering the regime of sub-100-milligram sources of gravity. Periodic modulation of the position of the source mass allows us to perform a spatial mapping of the gravitational force. Both linear and quadratic coupling are observed as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the gravitational potential. Our results extend the parameter space of gravity measurements to small, single source masses and low gravitational field strengths. Further improvements to our methodology will enable the isolation of gravity as a coupling force for objects below the Planck mass. This work opens the way to the unexplored frontier of microscopic source masses, which will enable studies of fundamental interactions 9–11 and provide a path towards exploring the quantum nature of gravity 12–15.

### Single-cycle surface plasmon polaritons on a bare metal wire excited by relativistic electrons [^81893982]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

SPP formation by transition radiation

By firing electron bunches onto the tip of a tapered metal wire, the radially polarized field of the electron bunches is transferred to the wire and continues to propagate along the wire as an SPP. The physical mechanism behind this process can be elucidated using the field line model for transition radiation as described by Purcell. Consider an electron travelling with velocity v in the z direction, reaching the tip of a metal wire with small cone angle at time t = 0. This situation is sketched in Fig. 1. For t < 0, the field is that of an undisturbed charge travelling in vacuum. The thin metal wire has negligible influence because the field of the electron at relativistic speeds is confined to a thin disk perpendicular to the direction of motion. For t > 0 when the electron is inside the metal wire, the electric fields are screened for an observer outside the metal. However, the screening is not instantaneous; instead it occurs on a sphere travelling outwards with the speed of light. Outside the sphere, indicated as region II in Fig. 1, the electric field is still that of the undisturbed charge in motion. Within the sphere, indicated as region I in Fig. 1, there is no electric field. However, the electric field lines in region II cannot abruptly end at the sphere; instead they follow the surface of the sphere ending on the metal wire where they induce a surface charge. This combination of electric fields and co-propagating surface charge is an SPP. As the electric field of an electron is very well matched to the cylindrically symmetric mode of a wire, it will excite a strong SPP. In case of an electron bunch rather than a single electron, the shell of field lines has a thickness vτ, where τ is the time it takes the bunch to pass the metal surface. We can easily calculate the electric field on the metal wire at the location of the expanding shell using Gauss's law on the closed surface indicated by the red dashed line in the figure. Because this Gauss volume does not enclose any charge, the net flux through the surface is zero. Therefore, the flux contained in the expanding sphere equals the flux crossing the Gauss volume near the surface of the wire, both being equal to q/ɛ 0, with q the bunch charge. On the surface of the wire, this flux is spread over an annulus with radius R and width cτ. This yields the field strength given by Equation (1).

### Modeling the electrical resistivity of polymer composites with segregated structures [^efc4bc6b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Computational modeling

To represent a random configuration of silica particles on a cubic domain, spheres are scattered by choosing the center coordinates of each individual sphere uniformly at random. Spheres are placed one-by-one so that the distances from the designated center position to the center positions of pre-existing spheres are apart from each other farther than the diameter. The diameter of the sphere is set to the average size of the silica filler, and the number of spheres per unit volume is determined according to the weight ratio of silica particles in the composite samples used in the experiments.

Upon the completion of the random placement of circular fillers, a CNT network is created on the domain by placing multiple random instances of a flexible wire. According to morphological characteristics as observed in the SEM and TEM images, a random instance of the wire is placed so that a CNT wire is distributed uniformly in the simulation domain and can proceed forwardly to pass through a gap between silica particles but cannot penetrate the particles. The flexibility of a CNT wire is reflected by modeling them as a series of small line segments connected with joints that can bend freely within a certain degree (up to 120°). To create a single wire on the domain, constituting line segments are placed in sequence from one side to the other. The first line segment is placed at random in the volume that spheres do not occupy. Subsequent line segments are placed in a straight line unless they touch spheres. If the line segment touches a sphere, the direction of the line segment is changed toward a tangential direction of the sphere in contact so that the wire smoothly circumvents the sphere. The width and length of a single wire are set to the average diameter and length of CNTs used in the experiment, respectively. The length of a line segment is set the same as the width of the wire, and thus the line segment can be thought as of a small spherical cylinder of the identical height and width, i.e. with a square side view. This facilitates the test for the connectivity of two wires since the contact suffices to check whether, at each endpoint of a line segment, there exists any other endpoint of a line segment from a different wire within a ball of radius equal to the length of the line segment centered at the endpoint. A graphical description of the procedure is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. A sample cubic domain of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm is taken from the composite model to obtain the CNT network. The connectivity of the domain is checked by examining the contacts between flexible wires. For a pair of two wires, all possible pairwise distances between two line segments from respective wires are calculated. If at least one value of the distances is less than 2 nm, which is based on a tunneling mechanism (see Supplementary Note 1) –, the two wires are considered to be in contact at the position of the corresponding line segments. A graphical representation of the procedure is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. A clustering analysis identifies percolating clusters of wires that span across the domain. Starting from the leftmost wires touching the left end, each cluster is expanded gradually toward the right end by including wires in contact. If a cluster contains one of the rightmost wires touching the right end, this cluster is declared to be a conducting path. For all conducting paths, KCL is applied at all junctions of wires to construct a system of linear equations about voltage drops across the junctions due to the contact resistivity (ρ c). In the simulation, ρ c is considered as a tunneling resistivity arising from the thin insulating layer (i.e. epoxy resin) between crossing CNTs –. Since 1 V voltage is assumed to apply across the domain, the inverse of the solution of the system of linear equations corresponds to the overall resistance of the network. This process is repeated to obtain 500 independent random instances, and an ensemble average of the resistance is calculated based on the set of tested samples between 30th percentile and 70th percentile. The simulation is conducted over different configurations of silica content, silica size, CNT content, and CNT dimension. For massive simulation, the source code is implemented in MATLAB parallel computing tool box.

### Intense equatorial flux spots on the surface of the earth's core [^02aebdcc]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

A large number of high-accuracy vector measurements of the Earth's magnetic field have recently become available from the satellite Oersted, complementing previous vector data from the satellite Magsat, which operated in 1979/80. These data can be used to infer the morphology of the magnetic field at the surface of the fluid core, approximately 2,900 km below the Earth's surface. Here I apply a new methodology to these data to calculate maps of the magnetic field at the core surface which show intense flux spots in equatorial regions. The intensity of these features is unusually large — some have intensities comparable to high-latitude flux patches near the poles, previously identified as the major component of the dynamo field. The tendency for pairing of some of these spots to the north and south of the geographical equator suggests they might be associated with the tops of equatorially symmetric columnar structures in the fluid, or their antisymmetric equivalents. The drift of the equatorial features may represent material flow or could represent wave motion; discrimination of these two effects based on future data could provide new information on the strength of the hidden toroidal magnetic field of the Earth.

### Meridional flows in the disk around a young star [^34604d69]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Protoplanetary disks are known to possess a variety of substructures in the distribution of their millimetre-sized grains, predominantly seen as rings and gaps 1, which are frequently interpreted as arising from the shepherding of large grains by either hidden, still-forming planets within the disk 2 or (magneto-)hydrodynamic instabilities 3. The velocity structure of the gas offers a unique probe of both the underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of the disk-such as movement of planet-building material from volatile-rich regions to the chemically inert midplane-and the details of the required removal of angular momentum. Here we report radial profiles of the three velocity components of gas in the upper layers of the disk of the young star HD 163296, as traced by emission from 12 CO molecules. These velocities reveal substantial flows from the surface of the disk towards its midplane at the radial locations of gaps that have been argued to be opened by embedded planets 4–7: these flows bear a striking resemblance to meridional flows, long predicted to occur during the early stages of planet formation 8–12. In addition, a persistent radial outflow is seen at the outer edge of the disk that is potentially the base of a wind associated with previously detected extended emission 12.

### Topologically cloaked magnetic colloidal transport [^16b123a9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Effect of imperfections

As explained in refs. –, in an ideal square pattern there are four fence points in control space. Real-world imperfections in magnetic patterns or external perturbations (external noise or imperfections in the magnetic film/disturbances in the magnetic pattern) can broaden those fence points into fence areas in control space. The fence area is usually a few degrees square in size and modulation loops must avoid this area to properly work as in the ideal case. Now, lets increase the size of the boat-shaped cloak like in supplementary video 2. There we have a family of fence areas instead of points, spreading at the equator and corresponding to differently rotated unit cells. In the ideal case, our control loopmust pass the equator through the small gap left between the different fence families to work for all unit cells. The broadening of a fence point to an area will make this gap thinner and thus complicate the satisfaction of having the same winding number of the loop for all members of the fence family. Indeed, the larger the boat-shaped cloak, the more accurate we have to orient the control loopwith respect to the pattern. Slight misalignment will destroy the proper course of a paramagnetic particle close to the left or right boundary of the cloak. Real-world imperfections are totally unimportant for small cloaks but become a challenge for larger cloaks.

Size limitations

Apart from rotating individual domains, the conformal map also changes the size of the domains. Let us pick the rounded square-shaped cloak to illustrate some practical challenges. Domains right at the two branch points are larger than the undeformed domains, while domains at the waist of the cloak are smaller. Larger domains can grow so large such that more than only the leading Fourier mode contributes to the colloidal potential. This undermines the scalability of the problem. Smaller domains promote the formation of bipeds since individual colloidal particles are brought close to each other. In our experiments with square cloaks, we had to switch from d = 2.8 μm dynabeads to d = 1 μm myone Dynabeads to avoid the formation of bipeds at the waist.

### Cylindrical compression of thin wires by irradiation with a joule-class short-pulse laser [^1e1b91ed]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Equation of state measurements at Jovian or stellar conditions are currently conducted by dynamic shock compression driven by multi-kilojoule multi-beam nanosecond-duration lasers. These experiments require precise design of the target and specific tailoring of the spatial and temporal laser profiles to reach the highest pressures. At the same time, the studies are limited by the low repetition rate of the lasers. Here, we show that by the irradiation of a thin wire with single-beam Joule-class short-pulse laser, a converging cylindrical shock is generated compressing the wire material to conditions relevant to the above applications. The shockwave was observed using Phase Contrast Imaging employing a hard X-ray Free Electron Laser with unprecedented temporal and spatial sensitivity. The data collected for Cu wires is in agreement with hydrodynamic simulations of an ablative shock launched by highly impulsive and transient resistive heating of the wire surface. The subsequent cylindrical shockwave travels toward the wire axis and is predicted to reach a compression factor of 9 and pressures above 800 Mbar. Simulations for astrophysical relevant materials underline the potential of this compression technique as a new tool for high energy density studies at high repetition rates.

### Mapping the ionosphere with millions of phones [^5a4893bd]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The ionosphere is a layer of weakly ionized plasma bathed in Earth's geomagnetic field extending about 50–1,500kilometres above Earth 1. The ionospheric total electron content varies in response to Earth's space environment, interfering with Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) signals, resulting in one of the largest sources of error for position, navigation and timing services 2. Networks of high-quality ground-based GNSS stations provide maps of ionospheric total electron content to correct these errors, but large spatiotemporal gaps in data from these stations mean that these maps may contain errors 3. Here we demonstrate that a distributed network of noisy sensors-in the form of millions of Android phones-can fill in many of these gaps and double the measurement coverage, providing an accurate picture of the ionosphere in areas of the world underserved by conventional infrastructure. Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe. We also show that the resulting ionosphere maps can improve location accuracy, which is our primary aim. This work demonstrates the potential of using a large distributed network of smartphones as a powerful scientific instrument for monitoring Earth.

### A distinct ripple-formation regime on mars revealed by the morphometrics of barchan dunes [^545d9f9e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sand mobilized by wind forms decimeter-scale impact ripples and decameter-scale or larger dunes on Earth and Mars. In addition to those two bedform scales, orbital and in situ images revealed a third distinct class of larger meter-scale ripples on Mars. Since their discovery, two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the formation of large martian ripples-that they originate from the growth in wavelength and height of decimeter-scale ripples or that they arise from the same hydrodynamic instability as windblown dunes or subaqueous bedforms instead. Here we provide evidence that large martian ripples form from the same hydrodynamic instability as windblown dunes and subaqueous ripples. Using an artificial neural network, we characterize the morphometrics of over a million isolated barchan dunes on Mars and analyze how their size and shape vary across Mars' surface. We find that the size of Mars' smallest dunes decreases with increasing atmospheric density with a power-law exponent predicted by hydrodynamic theory, similarly to meter-size ripples, tightly bounding a forbidden range in bedform sizes. Our results provide key evidence for a unifying model for the formation of subaqueous and windblown bedforms on planetary surfaces, offering a new quantitative tool to decipher Mars' atmospheric evolution.

### Ripples formed in low-pressure wind tunnels suggest mars's large windblown ripples are not impact ripples [^4b04bbd1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Sand ripples record interactions between planetary surfaces and environmental flows, providing paleoenvironmental archives when preserved into rocks. Two main ripple types form in sand: drag ripples, common in water, and impact ripples, exclusive to windblown surfaces. Enigmatic meter-scale aeolian ripples on Mars have been assumed to be impact ripples, though ground and orbiter-based observations suggest they may be drag ripples instead. Here, we report on low-pressure wind tunnel experiments in which large ripples formed and evolved from a flat bed. Observations demonstrate that impact and large ripples grow from distinct mechanisms. Large-ripple size aligns with predictions from drag-ripple theory, and associated sand fluxes are greater than predicted for impact ripples. These findings are inconsistent with an impact-ripple origin and instead suggest that large martian ripples are drag ripples. Windblown drag ripples constitute an untapped record of atmospheric evolution on planetary bodies with tenuous or ephemeral atmospheres across the Solar System.

### Shearing-induced asymmetry in entorhinal grid cells [^57d11eea]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells are neurons with periodic spatial receptive fields (grids) that tile two-dimensional space in a hexagonal pattern. To provide useful information about location, grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This, together with the near-absence of rotation in novel environments, suggests that the rotation emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents: a practice parameter [^e65ed728]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Assessment for facilitative factors of rodent exposure — focus areas and structural indicators: An assessment for facilitative factors of rodent exposure should focus on identifying food, water, routes of ingress, and the presence of rodent habitats. (Rec, C Evidence). Because rodents require food and water, their presence invites ingress, and entry holes can be as small as ¼ inch for mice and ¾ inch for rats; a typical nest can range from 5 inches for mice to 12 inches for rats.

### Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry [^b4e91865]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells represent an animal's location by firing in multiple fields arranged in a striking hexagonal array. Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.

### Two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20 [^f9fdc9d5]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around Sun-like stars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to the detection of true Earth analogues. The size of an exoplanet can be determined when it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing a decrease in starlight proportional to its radius. The smallest exoplanet hitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the Earth's radius (R(⊕)), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. Here we report the discovery of two planets, one Earth-sized (1.03R(⊕)) and the other smaller than the Earth (0.87R(⊕)), orbiting the star Kepler-20, which is already known to host three other, larger, transiting planets. The gravitational pull of the new planets on the parent star is too small to measure with current instrumentation. We apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood of the planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signals result from an eclipsing binary star. Theoretical considerations imply that these planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. The outer planet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

### A sensitive electrometer based on a rydberg atom in a schrödinger-cat state [^5b56fa03]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Fundamental quantum fluctuations caused by the Heisenberg principle limit measurement precision. If the uncertainty is distributed equally between conjugate variables of the meter system, the measurement precision cannot exceed the standard quantum limit. When the meter is a large angular momentum, going beyond the standard quantum limit requires non-classical states such as squeezed states or Schrödinger-cat-like states. However, the metrological use of the latter has been so far restricted to meters with a relatively small total angular momentum because the experimental preparation of these non-classical states is very challenging. Here we report a measurement of an electric field based on an electrometer consisting of a large angular momentum (quantum number J≈25) carried by a single atom in a high-energy Rydberg state. We show that the fundamental Heisenberg limit can be approached when the Rydberg atom undergoes a non-classical evolution through Schrödinger-cat states. Using this method, we reach a single-shot sensitivity of 1.2millivolts per centimetre for a 100-nanosecond interaction time, corresponding to 30microvolts per centimetre per square root hertz at our 3kilohertz repetition rate. This highly sensitive, non-invasive space- and time-resolved field measurement extends the realm of electrometric techniques and could have important practical applications: detection of individual electrons in mesoscopic devices at a distance of about 100micrometres with a megahertz bandwidth is within reach.

### MRI-based transfer function determination through the transfer matrix by jointly fitting the incident and scatteredfield [^745a801c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This describes the scattered field attributed to an arbitrarily shaped wire. In the model used here, the wire will be discretized into a number of line segments that correspond to the size of the transfer matrix (e.g. into 40 line segments of 5 mm for the 200‐mm wires considered here). The incident electric field is discretized to the same resolution. In the discretized form after introduction of the TM, Equation 6 can be approximated by a Riemann sum, that is,

which is linearly dependent on (the coefficients describing) the background field. In this equation, θ i is the angle the i th line segment makes with the z‐axis. The superposition of the circularly polarized RF transmit magnetic incident and scattered field, that is, the totalfield is hence given by, which is again linearly dependent on the coefficients in the SPACY decomposition. This model can be used to fit a measured or simulateddistribution.

Note that Equation 8 describes a complexdistribution of which the phase is not experimentally attainable. What can be measured is the so‐called transceive phase, which is the sum of the phase of theandfield. For birdcage coils, the phase of the background receive field is (nearly) equal to the phase of the background transmit field. 13 This is known as the transceive phase approximation stating that the transmit phase will be half the transceive phase. Using this approximation, we can describe the receive background phase with the same SPACY decomposition. A description similar to Equation 8 can be derived for the phase ofas a function of the same unknowns. The scattered field contribution to the receive fields is in the direction opposite to the nuclear precession leading to a complex conjugation of the scattered field. Hence, we can write down an expression for thephase, that is,

The transceive phase is the sum the phase given by this equation and the phase of Equation 8. It needs to be stressed that Equation 9 describes thephase in the assumption that the background transmit and receive phase are nearly equal. For our purpose, the decomposition of the magnitude of the receive field is not relevant given that we will only use the MRI‐measurable distributions (and transceive phase).

### Minimum entropy production by microswimmers with internal dissipation [^b59d2153]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Finally, we know that like any flow satisfying the boundary conditions of continuous tangential and zero normal velocity on the surface, the dissipation of the superposition flow satisfies the inequality (2), which states that. The equality is fulfilled exactly when the superposition corresponds to the flow around a droplet. This impliesand, along withand. These equations are solved to yieldWith these velocities, we finally obtain the minimum dissipation theoremBecause the equality in the theorem is fulfilled exactly if the superposition gives the flow around a droplet, we also know the distribution of velocities and active forces that minimize the dissipation while maintaining the swimming speed. The optimal slip velocity is given by the flow around the dropletand the tangential traction is opposite-equal to that of a no-slip body.

As a simple example, we apply the theorem to a spherical viscous droplet with external viscosity μ, internal viscosity μ i and radius a. According to the Hadamard–Rybczynski equation, the drag coefficient of the droplet isand we obtainFor equal viscosities, μ i = μ, the ratio of internal vs. external dissipation is 3: 2. The minimum dissipation then becomes. The simple additivity of external and internal dissipation only holds for a sphere. In general, the presence of internal dissipation will influence the optimal external velocity profile and vice versa.

Swimmer with an extended propulsive layer and tangential forces

The second problem we solve involves a swimmer with a no-slip surfacethat is propelled by tangential forces on a closed outer surface(Fig. 1 b), also called control surface. Such a model has been proposed to describe the ciliary layer, for example in Volvox. We now apply the inequality for a no-slip body with the shape of the inner surface. The superposition is formed with a composite passive body that has a no-slip boundaryat(Fig. 2 c). At the outer surface, the boundary condition is zero tangential velocityand continuity of normal stress n ⋅⋅ n, i.e. zero normal traction n ⋅ f CP = 0. The definition of the composite body ensures the orthogonality between active forces and the passive flow, which is required in the derivation below. At the same time, the choice of tangential-only forces at the outer surface ensures that it is always possible to find an active swimmer that exactly satisfies the superposition condition.

### Topologically cloaked magnetic colloidal transport [^fda138a5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cloaking is a method of making obstacles undetectable. Here we cloak unit cells of a magnetic pattern squeezed into an otherwise periodic pattern from a magnetically driven colloidal flow. We apply a time-periodic external magnetic field loop to an ensemble of paramagnetic colloidal particles on the deformed periodic magnetic pattern. There exist topological loops where the particles avoid to trespass the cloaked regions by robustly traveling around the cloak. Afterwards the ensemble of particles continues with a motion identical to the motion as if the distorted region were nonexistent and the ensemble would have trespassed the undeformed region. We construct the cloak by continuously squeezing new conformally mapped unit cells between those of the originally undeformed and periodic pattern. We find a cloaking/decloaking transition as a function of the size and shape of the newly squeezed-in region. A cloak is scalable to arbitrary size if the biholomorphic map from the undistorted periodic lattice to the region outside the cloak locally rotates by less than an angle of forty five degrees. The work generalizes cloaking from waves toward particles.

### Simultaneous polydirectional transport of colloidal bipeds [^863d74c1]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Transcription space

The orientation of the (dipolar) biped is locked to that of the external field with the northern foot being a magnetic north pole and the southern foot being a south pole. Let b n denote the vector from the northern foot to the southern foot of a biped of length b n, Fig. 1 a. The southern (northern) foot is on the ground if H ext points into the south (north) of. When H ext crosses the equator of, the biped is parallel to the pattern and the transfer between the feet occurs. Given the one-to-one correspondence between the biped orientation b n and that of the external field, we use b n to define unidirectional transcription spacesgiven by the surface of a sphere of radius b n. Each point oncorresponds to an orientation of a biped of length b n and there exists a one-to-one mapping betweenand. All unidirectional transcription spacescan be jointly represented in a polydirectional transcription spaceas concentric spheres of radius b n, Fig. 3 b. One point in polydirectional control spaceis simultaneously translated into a ray in polydirectional transcription space. The intersection between the ray and each unidirectional transcription space is a point that indicates the orientation of the rod. The entire modulation loopinis transcripted into a cone with arbitrary cross-section in. The intersection betweenand the cone is, the modulation loop for bipeds of length b n.

The importance of surfaces and interfaces cannot be overstated, with their reach extending from the hardware of the digital age to the processes of life.

### Four-channel surface coil array for 300-MHz pulsed EPR imaging: proof-of-concept experiments [^dbc0b5c2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Time-domain electron paramagnetic resonance imaging is currently a useful preclinical molecular imaging modality in experimental animals such as mice and is capable of quantitatively mapping hypoxia in tumor implants. The microseconds range relaxation times (T1 and T2) of paramagnetic tracers and the large bandwidths (tens of MHz) to be excited by electron paramagnetic resonance pulses for spatial encoding makes imaging of large objects a challenging task. The possibility of using multiple array coils to permit studies on large sized object is the purpose of the present work. Toward this end, the use of planar array coils in different configurations to image larger objects than cannot be fully covered by a single resonator element is explored. Multiple circular surface coils, which are arranged in a plane or at suitable angles mimicking a volume resonator, are used in imaging a phantom and a tumor-bearing mouse leg. The image was formed by combining the images collected from the individual coils with suitable scaling. The results support such a possibility. By multiplexing or interleaving the measurements from each element of such array resonators, one can scale up the size of the subject and at the same time reduce the radiofrequency power requirements and increase the sensitivity.

### Synchronously wired infrared antennas for resonant single-quantum-well photodetection up to room temperature [^ece78063]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The manipulation of electromagnetic waves with arrayed subwavelength resonators has long been a major topic in electronic engineering. Yagi–Uda antennas generate sharp beams from a half-wave emitter through near-field mutual coupling with parasitic elements arranged with deep subwavelength spacing. They present the most classic yet the most advanced form of coupled subwavelength resonators, and have extended the application range to the visible region. Phase-gradient metasurfaces, which create arbitrary wavefronts using arrays of deep subwavelength antennas with unequal shapes, have given rise to a new frontier in metamaterials that had previously focused on three-dimensional bulk materials. In these metasurfaces, the spacing between the antennas is smaller than the wavelength, but not too small to avoid strong near-field mutual coupling. Recently, through far-field mutual coupling, deep subwavelength resonators arranged with optimized wavelength-sized distances have demonstrated a coherent laser oscillation equivalent to a single, large, and high-power surface-emitting laser.

Arrays of optical patch antennashave also been used for perfect absorbersand thermal emitters. Optical patch antennas are subwavelength metal–insulator–metal (MIM) cavities that exhibit the half-wave resonance of the transverse-magnetic (TM) gap plasmon mode. One significant potential benefit of an MIM cavity is that the upper and lower metal layers can also be used as electrodes. By sandwiching functional materials, strong interaction with densely confined electromagnetic fields could enable the realization of high-performance optoelectronic devices. To achieve this, individual patch antennas electrically isolated so far should be interconnected by conducting wires. Recently, patch antennas one-dimensionally (1D) linked by simple straight wires have remarkably enhanced the sensitivity of infrared detectors, and even demonstrated gigahertz response at room temperature. However, their polarization dependence distorted by the wiring revealed the lack of reasonable design principles for electrical connection of arrayed patch antennas, in contrast to the extensively investigated single dipole antennas.

### Recurrent pattern completion drives the neocortical representation of sensory inference [^0684692c]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

These results demonstrate that mouse V1 contains neurons that respond to illusory bars as if they were real bars, in an orientation selective manner, despite the lack of contrast in their receptive field. These results were consistent between the Neuropixels dataset and the 2p calcium imaging dataset. Moreover, these results did not change when limiting the analyses to trials where the mouse's eye position stayed within eight visual degrees of the modal eye position, indicating that eye movements did not affect this conclusion (Extended Data Fig. 2). We further verified the illusory bar responsiveness and orientation selectivity for exclusively center-responsive V1 neurons using larger illusory gap sizes (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d), denser receptive field mappings (Extended Data Fig. 3e–h) and contrast bars instead of outline bars for determining orientation selectivity (Extended Data Fig. 3i–n). Taken together, V1 neurons with receptive fields within the illusory gap region can respond to illusory bars with the same orientation selectivity as to real bars.

A subpopulation of V1 neurons respond to ICs but not to its inducing segments

Although the classical definition of IC encoding neurons are neurons whose receptive field is contained within the gap region of the IC, neurons with receptive fields that overlap with one of the inducer segments could still be sensitive to the presence of the IC. If this were true, these neurons would be sensitive to the global arrangement of inducer elements that are outside their receptive fields. Indeed, several recent studies show that mouse V1 neurons are highly sensitive to contextual information outside their classical receptive fields, suggesting that neurons that are exclusively responsive to visual information within their classical receptive field may be more of an exception than the norm –. Thus, we sought to identify neurons that selectively encode ICs as a global emergent feature of the image, irrespective of their receptive fields.

### Closing the gap towards super-long suspension bridges using computational morphogenesis [^26c4cb1b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Giga-scale procedure

To solve the established optimization problem of the described bridge girder model, giga-scale procedures are a necessity. Due to the multiple length scales from the huge domain size of 75 m down to plate thickness as small as 6 mm (in the conventional design), billions of finite elements are required to discretize the domain into a sufficient fineness. The giga-scale morphogenesis procedures presented in ref. based on the PETSc – framework suitable for large-scale parallel computing, are thus extended to handle the given model and optimization problem. Hence, the domain enclosed by the outer dimensions in Supplementary Fig. 1 is discretized into 2.1 billion elements (corresponding to a mesh of 4384 × 1760 × 272 elements) with a maximum element size of 17 mm. Despite the element size being about three times larger than the smallest plate thickness in the conventional design, the fineness of the mesh is capable of revealing intriguing and detailed new structural features. The allowable volume fraction is chosen as V ✱ = 3.0%, close to the typical volume fractions of 1.0–1.5% in the conventional design (1.3% in the Osman Gazi Bridge). The slightly larger volume fraction is chosen to ensure detailed results, in connection with the corresponding larger element size in the model. The purpose of the optimization should meanwhile be clear to the reader: to give qualitative insight into how an optimized girder design could look, and thus not to show a final optimal structure. An exact volume fraction is thus not crucial for the study in question.

Considering the quite simple final result of our study, i.e. exchange original five straight spars with six curved ones, one could rightfully object that an expensive supercomputing procedure, as suggested, is overkill and a simple shape optimization procedure could have been sufficient. However, this outcome could not have been predicted without it. A priori, it was not known that this diaphragm layout and placement was key to the weight reduction. A change from five to six diaphragms would require more than a simple shape optimization process, and the bending of each of the diaphragms would have required knowledge of the required parameterization.

### Melting of the earth's inner core [^44fb985c]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

The Earth's magnetic field is generated by a dynamo in the liquid iron core, which convects in response to cooling of the overlying rocky mantle. The core freezes from the innermost surface outward, growing the solid inner core and releasing light elements that drive compositional convection. Mantle convection extracts heat from the core at a rate that has enormous lateral variations. Here we use geodynamo simulations to show that these variations are transferred to the inner-core boundary and can be large enough to cause heat to flow into the inner core. If this were to occur in the Earth, it would cause localized melting. Melting releases heavy liquid that could form the variable-composition layer suggested by an anomaly in seismic velocity in the 150 kilometres immediately above the inner-core boundary. This provides a very simple explanation of the existence of this layer, which otherwise requires additional assumptions such as locking of the inner core to the mantle, translation from its geopotential centre or convection with temperature equal to the solidus but with composition varying from the outer to the inner core. The predominantly narrow downwellings associated with freezing and broad upwellings associated with melting mean that the area of melting could be quite large despite the average dominance of freezing necessary to keep the dynamo going. Localized melting and freezing also provides a strong mechanism for creating seismic anomalies in the inner core itself, much stronger than the effects of variations in heat flow so far considered.

### Prediction of the strength and timing of sunspot cycle 25 reveal decadal-scale space environmental conditions [^8310ed88]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We calculate the flux associated with a BMR using an empirical relationship: Φ(A) = 7.0 × 10 19 A maxwells, where A is the area of the whole sunspot in units of micro-hemispheres. This flux is equally distributed among the two polarities of the BMR. Also, we can easily determine the value of radius (say, R spot) for each of the leading and following polarities from the area information. We assume that the radial separation (say, d) between the centroids of leading and following spots is proportional to R spot. The tilt angle (α) of the BMR is assigned in the following manner, where λ is the latitudinal position of the centroid of the whole BMR. The quantity T n accounts for the variation of tilt angle with cycle strength. The factor g is introduced to include the effect of localized inflows towards active regions, that is present on the photosphere apart from the large-scale inflows related to activity belts. These localized inflows effectively reduce the latitudinal separation between opposite polarities and allow less flux to reach the polar region.

Since the polar flux is proportional to tilt angle, we incorporate the impact of these localized inflows by reducing the tilt angle. We choose g to be equal to 0.7. Once we know the location of the centroid of the whole BMR in co-latitude(θ c) and longitude(ϕ c), the positions of individual polarities of the BMR are decided as follows:and, where 'l' and 'f' denote the leading and the following polarities respectively. The initial radial magnetic field associated with the BMR iswhereare the unsigned magnetic field distribution of the leading and following spots which have opposite polarities. Each spot is modeled as, where β l/f are the heliographic angle between (θ, ϕ) and the central coordinates of the leading and following polarities (θ l/f, ϕ l/f) respectively. B max is the maximum value of magnetic field of each polarity, which is automatically decided by the flux contained in the spot.

### Sparsity-based ankylography for recovering 3D molecular structures from single-shot 2D scattered light intensity [^166fcba3]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Methods

Mathematical formulation

Our mathematical problem amounts to construction of a 3D sparse signal from the Fourier magnitude on the Ewald's sphere.

Of course, when the majority of the information is lost, precise reconstruction is not possible, unless we have, or may assume, some additional information about the sought signal. In fact, the problem is even more difficult as the measurements contain noise. We assume that the scattered electro-magmatic field can be approximated adequately (hereafter, this relation is denoted by ≅) by means of known generating functions describing spheres U j (r) of radius R j. In other words, we want to reconstruct a 3D optical image assuming that it is comprised of a small known number of (different) spheres of known radii, as described in the Results section. Every kind of sphere U j (r) (identified by its radius R j) corresponds to a different atomic element (j, in this case), where the elements are known, and also how many atoms are there of each element. We emphasize that the reconstruction is done on a 3D grid, while the spheres themselves do not need to reside on any grid at all: they reflect the actual structure of the molecule which does not necessarily reside on a known grid.

### Elastic spheres can walk on water [^05fe2271]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To couple the sphere response to the fluid loading, we extend an existing hydrodynamic force model for circular disk-shaped skipping stonesby approximating the water-contacting face as a circular disk with radius λ eq R, where λ eq approximates the sphere deformation (see Fig. 3a and Methods section). The force is modelled as

where U B and β B describe the velocity of the water-contacting face and the wetted area S w is proportional to (λ eq R) 2. The equation for the vertical motion of the COM is then

where d 2 is the vertical coordinate of the COM and g is gravity. We can now predict how the hypothesized mechanisms relate to skipping. First, a larger area S w increases the magnitude of the hydrodynamic force term in equation 2. For a neo-Hookean material, S w increases with decreasing shear modulus G for a given applied compressive stress. Second, a smaller attack angle increases cos α thereby increasing the vertical force component that lifts the sphere off the surface. We note that the governing equations for the sphere deformation predict a steady-state solution in which the attack angle evolves asin response to a circumferential wave propagating in mode 1 − (see Supplementary Note 1). While the sphere deformation during impact is not steady-state, we nonetheless expect α to be governed by the speed of elastic waves propagating in the sphere through the characteristic distance R such that. Therefore, we predict that a more compliant sphere (smaller G) will assume a smaller rate of change of α, thereby increasing the upward vertical force that enables skipping.

### A rocky composition for an earth-sized exoplanet [^5d92dfd7]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Planets with sizes between that of Earth (with radius R Earth symbol) and Neptune (about 4R Earth symbol) are now known to be common around Sun-like stars. Most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which the planet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star. Measuring the planet's mass — and hence its density, which is a clue to its composition — is more difficult. Planets of size 2-4R Earth symbol have proved to have a wide range of densities, implying a diversity of compositions, but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as Earth. Here we report Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the Earth-sized planet Kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every 8.5hours (ref. 6). Given a radius of 1.20 ± 0.09 R Earth symbol and a mass of 1.69 ± 0.41 R Earth symbol, the planet's mean density of 5.3 ± 1.8gcm(-3) is similar to Earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron.

### Observations of discrete harmonics emerging from equatorial noise [^e892ef5a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

A number of modes of oscillations of particles and fields can exist in space plasmas. Since the early 1970s, space missions have observed noise-like plasma waves near the geomagnetic equator known as 'equatorial noise'. Several theories were suggested, but clear observational evidence supported by realistic modelling has not been provided. Here we report on observations by the Cluster mission that clearly show the highly structured and periodic pattern of these waves. Very narrow-banded emissions at frequencies corresponding to exact multiples of the proton gyrofrequency (frequency of gyration around the field line) from the 17th up to the 30th harmonic are observed, indicating that these waves are generated by the proton distributions. Simultaneously with these coherent periodic structures in waves, the Cluster spacecraft observes 'ring' distributions of protons in velocity space that provide the free energy for the waves. Calculated wave growth based on ion distributions shows a very similar pattern to the observations.

### Colloid science: non-spherical bubbles [^a1f7f043]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Surface tension gives gas bubbles their perfect spherical shape by minimizing the surface area for a given volume. Here we show that gas bubbles and liquid drops can exist in stable, non-spherical shapes if the surface is covered, or 'armoured', with a close-packed monolayer of particles. When two spherical armoured bubbles are fused, jamming of the particles on the interface supports the unequal stresses that are necessary to stabilize a non-spherical shape.

### Cylindrical compression of thin wires by irradiation with a joule-class short-pulse laser [^c9ead834]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While the lifetime of such currents was estimated by Quinn et al. to be 20 ps, one order of magnitude longer than the ps duration of the laser pulse used, recent theoretical work has been focused on laser pulses matched to our experiment of several tens fs, work that follows a multi-scale approach. PIC simulations are used in the first step to calculate the current density profile along an extended wire. With a model detailed by equation (1), a temperature distribution is evaluated from the current density within the skin depth at the wire surface. Finally, this temperature distribution is used as initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations to predict the long-term shock formation, propagation and density compression. To confirm this scenario, we have performed 2D PIC simulations of the laser interaction with a 10 μm diameter Cu wire target. We observe the formation of a return peak current of 2.8 × 10 13 A/cm 2, with a lifetime of 100fs (Fig. 2 a shows j y and associated magnetic field for t = 38 fs after the peak of the interaction, and Fig. 2 b the time evolution peak of j y at a distance of 8 μm away from the focus). The surface return current has two effects on the wire target which can lead to compression: the magnetic compression and Joule heating and the associated ablation. While the return current magnitude scales inverse of the wire radius, for a 25 μm diameter copper wire, the peak of the surface return current density is predicted to be in the range of 0.4–1.1 × 10 13 A/cm 2, with a current strength decaying further away from the laser focus. At the time when the return current is maximal, the thermal pressure is evaluated to be 8 times higher than the magnetic pressure of 250 Mbar. The resulting plasma β ≈ 8 confirms the kinetic nature of our shock formation. The electron temperature distribution to be used as initial condition for the hydro simulations is estimated using the electron energy equation, whereis the thermal conductivity of cold electrons, is the electric conductivity, and j e (r) is the surface return current distribution in the radial direction from PIC (Fig. 2 c). The equation's right side accounts for heat diffusion in the radial direction and the Joule heating due to the surface return current. The electron resistivity model and the heat diffusion coefficient are functions of temperature and density and can be extracted from the SESAME equation of state. The calculated electron temperature with this equation peaks at 140–320 eV for the return current range of 0.4–1.1 × 10 13 A/cm 2 and is distributed within a 0.1 μm skin depth layer. This temperature distribution is used as the initial condition for hydrodynamic simulation to investigate plasma evolution until 1 ns. These simulations with the FLASH code, solve in a 1D cylindrical symmetry the one fluid, two-species (ion and electron) and two-temperatures hydrodynamic equations with copper SESAME equation of state. The ion temperature and electron temperature are assumed to be equal due to the high collision rates between these.

### Mice alternate between discrete strategies during perceptual decision-making [^285ba7f1]. Nature Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

Classical models of perceptual decision-making assume that subjects use a single, consistent strategy to form decisions, or that decision-making strategies evolve slowly over time. Here we present new analyses suggesting that this common view is incorrect. We analyzed data from mouse and human decision-making experiments and found that choice behavior relies on an interplay among multiple interleaved strategies. These strategies, characterized by states in a hidden Markov model, persist for tens to hundreds of trials before switching, and often switch multiple times within a session. The identified decision-making strategies were highly consistent across mice and comprised a single 'engaged' state, in which decisions relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and several biased states in which errors frequently occurred. These results provide a powerful alternate explanation for 'lapses' often observed in rodent behavioral experiments, and suggest that standard measures of performance mask the presence of major changes in strategy across trials.

### Human mobility is well described by closed-form gravity-like models learned automatically from data [^f2a1d486]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The absolute relative error and the absolute log-ratio do take into account the effect of the magnitude of the flow, and therefore are more informative of the global behavior of a model when the range of flows spans several orders of magnitude (Fig. S3 M–X). An issue with the relative error is that while it penalizes over-prediction, it does not penalize under-prediction; in the extreme case in which the predicted flow equals zero and the real flow is larger than zero, the relative error is equal to one. As a result, distributions for relative errors in gravity-like models and the deep gravity model, in which small flows are under-predicted, are centered around 1 (Supplementary Figs. S2, S3 M–R). By contrast, the absolute log-ratio has the property that over- and under-prediction are equally penalized (in a logarithmic scale), that is, predicting the real flow multiplied or divided by the same factor results in same absolute log-ratio. This metric, therefore, captures the ability of a model to predict flows in any range of values (Supplementary Fig. S3 S–X).

Using these metrics, we compare the different modeling approaches (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The first conclusion from this comparison is that gravity models, including the radiation model, are never the best performers; for all states and metrics considered, there is always at least one other model that performs better. This is not surprising, since these models are simple and highly stylized, and they have already been shown to make less accurate predictions than deep gravity models.

Perhaps more surprisingly, we find that closed-form mathematical models obtained by the BMS perform, overall, comparably to random forest models and better than deep gravity models. Indeed, the most plausible model (BMS Plausible) performs better than deep gravity for 21 of the 24 comparisons we can make (four metrics on each of the six states), whereas it performs better than random forests in 13/24 comparisons and worse in the remaining 11/24 (Fig. S3). On average, over the six states, BMS models perform indistinguishably from random forests on all quality metrics, and better than deep gravity models in terms of relative error and log ratio (Fig. 3 I–L). Remarkably, deep gravity models are only best performers in terms of CPC, and even they are not significantly better than BMS models or random forests, a result that is consistent with previous findings.

### Nonlinear spatiotemporal integration by electrical and chemical synapses in the retina [^fc6c208c]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Electrical and chemical synapses coexist in circuits throughout the CNS. Yet, it is not well understood how electrical and chemical synaptic transmission interact to determine the functional output of networks endowed with both types of synapse. We found that release of glutamate from bipolar cells onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was strongly shaped by gap-junction-mediated electrical coupling within the bipolar cell network of the mouse retina. Specifically, electrical synapses spread signals laterally between bipolar cells, and this lateral spread contributed to a nonlinear enhancement of bipolar cell output to visual stimuli presented closely in space and time. Our findings thus (1) highlight how electrical and chemical transmission can work in concert to influence network output and (2) reveal a previously unappreciated circuit mechanism that increases RGC sensitivity to spatiotemporally correlated input, such as that produced by motion.

### Atomic layer lithography of wafer-scale nanogap arrays for extreme confinement of electromagnetic waves [^b388816a]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Squeezing light through nanometre-wide gaps in metals can lead to extreme field enhancements, nonlocal electromagnetic effects and light-induced electron tunnelling. This intriguing regime, however, has not been readily accessible to experimentalists because of the lack of reliable technology to fabricate uniform nanogaps with atomic-scale resolution and high throughput. Here we introduce a new patterning technology based on atomic layer deposition and simple adhesive-tape-based planarization. Using this method, we create vertically oriented gaps in opaque metal films along the entire contour of a millimetre-sized pattern, with gap widths as narrow as 9.9 Å, and pack 150,000 such devices on a 4-inch wafer. Electromagnetic waves pass exclusively through the nanogaps, enabling background-free transmission measurements. We observe resonant transmission of near-infrared waves through 1.1-nm-wide gaps (λ/1,295) and measure an effective refractive index of 17.8. We also observe resonant transmission of millimetre waves through 1.1-nm-wide gaps (λ/4,000,000) and infer an unprecedented field enhancement factor of 25,000.

Electrical inspection steps for housing inspectors — The basic tools required for making an electrical inspection are fuse and circuit testers and a flashlight, and because you are dealing with electricity you should take no chances. Inspectors should go to the site of the ground, usually at the water meter, and check the ground; it should connect to the water line on the street side of the water meter or be equipped with a jumper wire, and no box or wire should be touched until the ground is confirmed. Inspectors should then check the main fuse box or circuit breaker box for operational integrity of all fuses and breakers, note the condition of the wiring and box and whether it is overfused, and examine wiring in the basement while standing in a dry spot.

### One-third of sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks [^c6027421]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

We prepare the data products from each TESS sector or K2 campaign by removing any 'NaNs' from the data series and dividing the light curve by the median flux. Some objects were observed over several sectors or campaigns. If an object was observed over two or more consecutive TESS sectors, we stitch the data together to form one light curve. We do not merge light curves that are separated by one or more sectors because the spot evolution that occurs during long gaps in time may cause the rotation signature to no longer be coherent over the duration of the time series, making it difficult to properly assess the periodogramand the phase curve. Next, we remove features unrelated to rotational variability from the data (that is, flares and other photometric outliers) by applying a high-pass Savitzky–Golay filterand selecting only the points in the original dataset that fall within three standard deviations of the flattened time series. After detrending the data, we compute generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogramsof the prepared light curves with a sampling resolution of 0.01 days over a search window from 0.2 days to one-third of the total length of time in the light curve. We identify the stellar rotation period as that which corresponds to the maximum signal in the periodogram. The uncertainty on P rot is estimated as the half-width of the peak profile in the power spectrum. If one object has more than one TESS or K2 light curve, each light curve is analysed separately and we adopt the weighted mean of the individual results.

Doppler imaging of young stars demonstrates that spots can exist at high and intermediate latitudes rather than at the equator –. This can affect the measured rotation periods if the young stars in our sample experience differential rotation. Periodic signals detected in the light curves may not actually trace the equatorial rotation period used to compute the stellar inclination angle, which would bias the results towards higher values of i *. We account for the effect of possible differential rotation of spots at unknown latitudes by inflating the uncertainties of the rotation periods with an error term σ shear that represents half the maximum difference in rotation between the pole and the equator. This term relates the star's absolute shear, Δ Ω (a metric to quantify differential rotation), and the equatorial rotation period, P max, determined from the light curve:

### Rotational breakup as the origin of small binary asteroids [^03635666]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Asteroids with satellites are observed throughout the Solar System, from subkilometre near-Earth asteroid pairs to systems of large and distant bodies in the Kuiper belt. The smallest and closest systems are found among the near-Earth and small inner main-belt asteroids, which typically have rapidly rotating primaries and close secondaries on circular orbits. About 15 per cent of near-Earth and main-belt asteroids with diameters under 10 km have satellites. The mechanism that forms such similar binaries in these two dynamically different populations was hitherto unclear. Here we show that these binaries are created by the slow spinup of a 'rubble pile' asteroid by means of the thermal YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack) effect. We find that mass shed from the equator of a critically spinning body accretes into a satellite if the material is collisionally dissipative and the primary maintains a low equatorial elongation. The satellite forms mostly from material originating near the primary's surface and enters into a close, low-eccentricity orbit. The properties of binaries produced by our model match those currently observed in the small near-Earth and main-belt asteroid populations, including 1999 KW(4) (refs 3, 4).

### Carbonate formation and fluctuating habitability on mars [^36e7d239]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Meanwhile, at Jezero's rim, carbonate-rich sedimentary rocks have now been confirmed in situ, and apparently formed on the shores of an ancient lake. These materials probably formed post-3.5 Ga, and extend for tens of kilometres and around the rim.

Thus, on Mars as on Earth, carbonate formation and sedimentary-rock formation (and early-diagenetic alteration) can be coupled. This coupling motivates re-evaluating the hypothesis that Mars's sedimentary rocks were not just a witness, but also a driver, of surface conditions becoming less habitable.

Surface and near-surface liquid water is needed for a habitable climate; other essential ingredients for habitability (for example, organic matter) were present on Mars. Evidence of a habitable climate on early Mars is recorded by sedimentary rocks, which give space and time constraints on surface conditions. We focus on post-3.5-Ga Mars, when Mount Sharp's magnesium-sulfate-bearing unit and overlying light-toned unit (termed 'rhythmite', so-called because of its regular layer thickness) were formed. Together, these rock types ('orbital facies') cover 2 × 10 6 km 2 (Extended Data Fig. 1) — likely a lower bound on the spatial extent of liquid water, as their lithification probably involved liquid water. However, local areas of water availability, here referred to as oases, were patchy, as much of Mars was dry after about 3.5 Ga (for example, ref.). Indeed, almost all post-3.5-Ga sedimentary-rock outcrops (by volume) are in 3 longitudinal pockets < 10° from the equator (Methods). These rocks formed over a span of more than 1 Gyr, and apparently as late as 0.5 Ga. Sedimentation rates estimated from rhythmic strata are 0.03–1.5 m kyr −1 (refs.). Large unconformities record basin-scale (global?) pauses in sedimentation (for example, ref.).

### An on-chip phased array for non-classical light [^580e72b9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Quantum science and technology can offer fundamental enhancements in sensing, communications and computing. The expansion from wired to wireless links is an exciting prospect for quantum technologies. For classical technologies, the advent of phased arrays enabled directional and adaptive wireless links by manipulating electromagnetic waves over free space. Here we demonstrate a phased array system on a chip that can receive, image and manipulate non-classical light over free space. We use an integrated photonic-electronic system with more than 1000 functional components on-chip to detect squeezed light. By integrating an array of 32 sub-wavelength engineered metamaterial antennas, we demonstrate a direct free-space-to-chip interface for reconfigurable quantum links. On the same chip, we implement a large-scale array of quantum-limited coherent receivers that can resolve non-classical signals simultaneously across 32 channels. With coherent readout and manipulation of these signals, we demonstrate 32-pixel imaging and spatially configurable reception of squeezed light over free space. Our work advances wireless quantum technologies that could enable practical applications in quantum communications and sensing.

### Simulations of the formation, evolution and clustering of galaxies and quasars [^7f0b5e85]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.

### Lateral competition for cortical space by layer-specific horizontal circuits [^a58eb0af]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

The cerebral cortex constructs a coherent representation of the world by integrating distinct features of the sensory environment. Although these features are processed vertically across cortical layers, horizontal projections interconnecting neighbouring cortical domains allow these features to be processed in a context-dependent manner. Despite the wealth of physiological and psychophysical studies addressing the function of horizontal projections, how they coordinate activity among cortical domains remains poorly understood. We addressed this question by selectively activating horizontal projection neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, and determined how the resulting spatial pattern of excitation and inhibition affects cortical activity. We found that horizontal projections suppress superficial layers while simultaneously activating deeper cortical output layers. This layer-specific modulation does not result from a spatial separation of excitation and inhibition, but from a layer-specific ratio between these two opposing conductances. Through this mechanism, cortical domains exploit horizontal projections to compete for cortical space.

### An earth-sized planet with an earth-like density [^69878a65]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Recent analyses of data from the NASA Kepler spacecraft have established that planets with radii within 25 per cent of the Earth's (R Earth symbol) are commonplace throughout the Galaxy, orbiting at least 16.5 per cent of Sun-like stars. Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed similar to the Earth in bulk composition. The smallest planets for which masses have been accurately determined are Kepler-10b (1.42 R Earth symbol) and Kepler-36b (1.49 R Earth symbol), which are both significantly larger than the Earth. Recently, the planet Kepler-78b was discovered and found to have a radius of only 1.16 R Earth symbol. Here we report that the mass of this planet is 1.86 Earth masses. The resulting mean density of the planet is 5.57gcm(-3), which is similar to that of the Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^43945100]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning injuries — regional considerations highlight weather, geography, and situational risks: Lightning strikes are not uniformly distributed around the Earth, and thunderstorms are formed by 3 atmospheric elements: moisture, warm air on the surface of the earth, and a lifting wind. Geography influences incidence, with Central Africa having the greatest incidence of lightning strikes because of its mountainous terrain coupled with moist airflow from the Atlantic Ocean, leading to year-round thunderstorms; worldwide, rural populations have been at greatest risk, attributed to higher occupational exposure and limited access to substantial buildings for shelter. Though rare, lightning is possible even if the overlying sky is blue (so-called bolt from the blue) and can occur in sunny conditions after a storm, posing a risk to people who return to outdoor activity too soon; lightning is also possible in snowstorms, and graupel heralds weather favorable to lightning formation by generating the electrical gradient that facilitates lightning formation.

### Aviation effects on already-existing cirrus clouds [^94f748ff]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Determining the effects of the formation of contrails within natural cirrus clouds has proven to be challenging. Quantifying any such effects is necessary if we are to properly account for the influence of aviation on climate. Here we quantify the effect of aircraft on the optical thickness of already-existing cirrus clouds by matching actual aircraft flight tracks to satellite lidar measurements. We show that there is a systematic, statistically significant increase in normalized cirrus cloud optical thickness inside mid-latitude flight tracks compared with adjacent areas immediately outside the tracks.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^90ce5be7]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres < oblate ellipsoids < prolate ellipsoids < dimers < spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

### Wavefront shaping through emulated curved space in waveguide settings [^7d0cc29e]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To transform a broad Gaussian beam (FWHM ∼30 μm) into this non-diffracting beam in a planar waveguide setting, we fabricate a specific refractive index structure inspired by the concepts of curved space known from GR. Namely, curved space generated by a massive gravitational body leads to gravitational lensing, that can in principle overcome diffraction broadening and cause beam collimation. The planar waveguide has a unique width profile, causing a change in the propagation constant and effectively modifying the refractive index. The structure is shown in Fig. 2a. During the fabrication process, a silver film is deposited on a silica (SiO 2) substrate with a thickness of 80 nm, followed by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microsphere powder scattered on the substrate. The microspheres are distributed on the substrate, with a small density and large separation distance between microspheres. The sample processing includes a stage where the sample is put on the heating table (300 °C) for 30 s. As the melting temperature of PMMA polymer is ∼250 °C, the heating process deforms the PMMA microspheres into domes, just as shown in Fig. 2b, c. In this process, the size of resultant PMMA domes is not uniform, and their diameters can vary greatly, from 1 to 100 μm. For the experiment presented here, we work with one of domes that has an appropriate size, as shown in its optical microscope image in Fig. 2b. The structure is shaped as a dome protruding from the plane of the waveguide (Fig. 2a). This is further confirmed by mapping the surface structure with atomic force microcopy (Asylum Research, MFP-3D-SA, USA), as shown in Fig. 2c. Next, a set of gratings with the period 310 nm are drilled on the sliver film around the microdroplet with focused ion beam (FEI Strata FIB 201, 30 keV, 150 pA). These gratings enable to couple the light into the slab waveguide. Next, we spin-coat the sample with a PMMA photoresist mixed with rare earth (Eu 3+) to a thickness of ∼1 μm, and subsequently dry the sample in the oven at 70 °C for 2 h. The Eu 3+ rare earth ions are added to the sample to facilitate fluorescence imaging that will reveal the propagation dynamics of the beam. These Eu 3+ ions absorb the beam propagating in the slab waveguide, whose wavelength (457 nm) is specifically chosen to excite the rare earth ions, that in turn emit fluorescent light at 615 nm wavelength. We note that, although the 1-μm-thick PMMA layer is not single-mode waveguide for the 457 nm beam, the designed grating allows only one mode to be excited inside the waveguide. Here, only the TM3 mode is excited in our experiment (The grating is designed that only one waveguide mode is excited. Hence, plasmonic modes are not excited in the experiment). The resultant 2D structure of the refractive index is displayed in Fig. 2d, together with a 3D illustration of the entire sample (Fig. 2a). Figure 2c shows the width of the PMMA waveguide as mapped by AFM measurements. From this width, we calculate the refractive index structure displayed in Fig. 2d, which is fitted with the function, with n 0 = 1.37, a = 9.22 × 10 −2, r c = 9.69. Recall that the refractive index of bulk PMMA polymer is 1.49, hence our fabrication process reduces the refractive index according to our design. Specifically, in the region of the dome, the thickness is increased to 3.5 μm, and therefore the effective index of the TM3 waveguide mode is increased from 1.37 to 1.49.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^3d869f3e]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Healthy Housing Reference Manual — rodent management in housing emphasizes eliminating food sources and eliminating breeding and nesting places, with items stored above ground with 18 inches of clearance below them. For rat proofing, all openings more than ¾-inch wide should be closed, cracks around doors, gratings, windows, and similar openings should be covered if they are less than 4 feet above the ground, and suitable materials include sheet metal of at least 26-gauge, ¼-inch or ½-inch hardware cloth, and cement; however, ½-inch hardware cloth has little value against house mice. Design should account that rats can routinely jump 2 feet vertically, dig 4 feet or more to get under a foundation, and climb rough walls or smooth pipes up to 3 inches in diameter. The first three strategies — good sanitation techniques, habitat denial, and rat proofing — should be used initially in any rodent management program. If further control is required, a more effective alternative is trapping, with the two main groups of rat and mouse traps being live traps and kill traps, and to be effective, traps must be monitored and emptied or removed quickly.

### Modeling and measurement of lead tip heating and resonant length for implanted, insulated wires [^130fac99]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The temperature rise in the first line of Equation (22) for short wire is the same as the prediction of the simple exponential model Equation (14). Interestingly, the second line of Equation (22) predicts that the temperature rise is reduced by a factor of four for an equivalent electric field for a short wire when.

Finally, recall that all the theoretical results in this section were derived under the assumption of a constant electric field. We note that from Equation (3), because a constant electric field is symmetric, that is, Equations (17–22) remain unchanged regardless of whether the expression in Equations (15) or (16) is used for the transfer function. For the case of a spatially varying electric field vector, the analytical results derived in this section are no longer directly applicable, but are replaced by evaluating Equation (3) numerically with discrete summation and a transfer function from Equations (6) or (16). Additionally, it is worth noting that given an arbitrary electric field vectorobtained from simulations, we can obtain its tangential componentusing Equation (4) if the path of the wire is known. In practice, the wire path can be determined from an X-ray or CT data, as described in Golestanirad et al.and Bardwell et al.

### An optical neural chip for implementing complex-valued neural network [^64866747]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In the binary classification, the decision boundary partitions the underlying vector space into two regions, one for each class. The decision boundaries of the simulated real-valued model, the complex-valued model and the on-chip implemented complex model when classifying the Circle and the Spiral are shown in Fig. 5b, c, respectively. As shown, the decision boundaries of the real model are formed by straight lines, while the decision boundaries of the complex model are nonlinear curves that perfectly match the entangled shape of the datasets. The complex model is also appreciably superior in classification accuracy. The complex model achieves simulated accuracy of 100% on both datasets, far exceeding the 55% (on Circle) and 89% (on Spiral) achieved by the real model. In chip implementation, we scan both inputs x 1 and x 2 from −1 to 1 by a step size of 0.1. A total 441 input sets are tested. In experiment results, the black wires are our expected decision boundaries while the white wires are experimental ones, from which we can easily figure out which points are incorrectly classified. The chip testing accuracies are 98% for the Circle and 95% for the Spiral. The theoretical decision boundaries of the complex model are smooth, while the visualized resolution is reduced by the input interval in experiment.

The theoretical decision boundaries can be derived. Suppose we have a single layer with two neurons, the outputs of the real model arewhere the w 11,12,21,22 and b 1,2 are real-valued, x 1,2 are real inputs and y 1,2 are the outputs. The decision boundary is derived by solving the equation || y 1 || = || y 2 ||. Therefore, the decision surface is formed by two straight lines:

In the complex model, we replace the weight matrices by w jk = p jk + iq jk, and b j = m j + in j, where j, k = 1, 2. By solving || y 1 || = || y 2 ||, a nonlinear decision boundary is formed bywhich can be simplified to a binary quadratic equation:

Equation (5) can form various curves, such as parabola, circle, ellipse, and hyperbola, with different parameters A–F, which can be learned from training data. For nonlinear dataset, the complex-valued network shows strong learning capability, by forming nonlinear decision boundaries and achieving high classification accuracy.

### Centimeter-scale nanomechanical resonators with low dissipation [^10c0a1c9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

High-aspect-ratio mechanical resonators are pivotal in precision sensing, from macroscopic gravitational wave detectors to nanoscale acoustics. However, fabrication challenges and high computational costs have limited the length-to-thickness ratio of these devices, leaving a largely unexplored regime in nano-engineering. We present nanomechanical resonators that extend centimeters in length yet retain nanometer thickness. We explore this expanded design space using an optimization approach which judiciously employs fast millimeter-scale simulations to steer the more computationally intensive centimeter-scale design optimization. By employing delicate nanofabrication techniques, our approach ensures high-yield realization, experimentally confirming room-temperature quality factors close to theoretical predictions. The synergy between nanofabrication, design optimization guided by machine learning, and precision engineering opens a solid-state path to room-temperature quality factors approaching 10 billion at kilohertz mechanical frequencies - comparable to the performance of leading cryogenic resonators and levitated nanospheres, even under significantly less stringent temperature and vacuum conditions.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^5f3a67c5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Statistical design, analysis, and reporting for SABV in preclinical in vitro studies emphasize power analysis and transparent sex-based planning: researchers "should determine minimum group sizes and sex allocations based on primary outcomes and effect sizes from preliminary studies". "Ideally, an equal number of male and female biological replicates should be used; at a minimum, the sex of biological replicates should be recorded a priori". "Preliminary findings can guide the two-way ANOVA to assess sex as an independent variable and its interaction with other factors", and "incorporating existing sample sizes and power analyses will aid in designing future studies focused on sex differences". Reporting expectations include that "reporting effect size, statistical power, and predicted sample sizes for each sex is essential for accurately calculating the necessary sample size to examine SABV (190)". For powering sex effects, "sample sizes must be calculated separately for each sex and then combined, accounting for sex differences in disease incidence and effect size", and "the ideal study design for evaluating sex differences should be powered to detect statistically significant sex-by-treatment interactions", noting "such a study requires a larger sample size than one designed solely to detect the main effect or sex alone (191)". When sex differences are not the primary focus and sizing is uncertain, investigators can follow "The Four C's of Studying Sex to Strengthen Science": "1) Consider — design studies that account for sex or justify its exclusion; 2) Collect — gather sex-based data; 3) Characterize — analyze sex-specific data; and 4) Communicate — report and publish".

### Sample size matters: a guide for surgeons [^ef351ef4]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Considerations of sample size computations in the medical literature have gained increasing importance over the past decade and are now often mandatory for scientific grant proposals, protocols, and publications. However, many surgeons are ill-prepared to understand the parameters on which the appropriate sample size is based. The present article has several objectives: first, to review the need for sample size considerations; second, to explain the ingredients necessary for sample size computations in simple, nonmathematic language; third, to provide options for reducing the sample size if it seems impracticably large; and fourth, to help avoid some of the more common mistakes encountered when computing sample sizes.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^02791c69]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A, The frequency obtained by averaging withinincluding the whole magnetic microstructure. B, The volume outsidehas been coarse grained. C, The magnetic microstructure has been nulled within, and the frequency is calculated at the point. The frequency is induced by an external field. The mesoscopic region is tested as a cube, sphere and cylinder.

3.1.3 Simulation (b). The voxel‐averaged Larmor frequency in a sample with varying microstructure

The purpose of the next simulation was to validate Equation (21) describing the MRI‐measured Larmor frequency when the sample consists of a slowly varying magnetic microstructure, and quantify the error we obtain when (b1) we filter the measured Larmor frequency (as described in Equation 8), (b2) neglect the sampling PSF (as explained in Appendix A.2) and finally (b3) partition the magnetic microstructure in order to compute the macroscopic contribution (cf. Equation 57 in Appendix A.2) to the measured Larmor frequency.

Figure 5 illustrates the sample used to test the error from these three points. We constructed a sample consisting of 27 cubes, denoted, stacked(blue square in Figure 5A). Each cube had side length(see Figure 5) and contained a configuration of cylinders with a randomly chosen axially symmetric orientation dispersion and volume fraction(i.e. different for each cube). Susceptibility variations were introduced by randomly choosing a normalized microscopic susceptibilityfor each cube (in reality, but as we only consider field ratios the absolute magnitude is irrelevant). The sample was further partitioned into smaller cubeswith center points denotedand with side length, i.e. one‐third of the larger cubes(indicated by the orange square in Figure 5A). This construction ensured a sample with a more slowly varying microstructure across, as seen at, since the abrupt edges between the cubesare far away. Thus, every large cubewith a distinct magnetic microstructure contained 27 smaller cubes, and so the entire sample was partitioned into 729 cubesstacked.

### Force-bearing phagocytic adhesion rings mediate the phagocytosis of surface-bound particles [^00418e8a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Many micro-particles including pathogens strongly adhere to hosts. It remains elusive how macrophages detach these surface-bound particles during phagocytosis. We show that, rather than binding directly to these particles, macrophages form unique β 2 integrin-mediated adhesion structures at the cell-substrate interfaces, specifically encircling the surface-bound particles. These circular adhesion structures that we named phagocytic adhesion rings (PARs) serve as strongholds to support local ring-shaped actin structures constricting into the particle-substrate cleavages, thereby pinching off the particles from the substrate. During this process, integrins in PARs sustain tensions due to the reaction force of actin polymerization against the particles. Such tensions are critical for phagocytic efficiency of surface-bound particles. PARs were formed in all tested macrophages (mouse, human and fish) and micron-sized particles (microbeads and E. coli), demonstrating their conserved role in the phagocytosis. This study reveals a mechanism of PAR-mediated phagocytosis, specialized for the detachment and internalization of surface-bound particles.

### Observation and control of casimir effects in a sphere-plate-sphere system [^5ddfd725]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The interaction between three objects give rise to many fascinating phenomena such as chaos of astronomical objects, Efimov bound states of ultracold atoms, and frustrated states of quantum spin systems. It is intriguing to consider the potential of three-body interactions arising solely from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations (virtual photons) –. As quantum electromagnetic fluctuations exist everywhere in the universe and in human-made devices, the Casimir effect is ubiquitous. However, the Casimir effect is often neglected or treated as a detrimental effect in micro-electromechanical systems and nano-electromechanical systems. It will be beneficial to develop useful applications of the Casimir effect. One application of the Casimir effect is to provide a new approach to couple mechanical resonators. Different from optomechanical coupling with real photons in cavity optomechanics –, optomechanical coupling with virtual photons will not suffer from cavity loss and thus will not require a high-quality cavity. Compared to electrostatic coupling, the Casimir effect does not require charge and will work for both conductors and insulators. Compared to the optical force, the Casimir force works for both transparent and opaque materials. Meanwhile, the use of the Casimir force does not prevent the use of the electrostatic force and the optical force. They may be combined to achieve more advanced functions. In addition, the Casimir effect is energy efficient as it does not require a voltage source or a light source to maintain, which will be particularly important for devices operating in the quantum regime at low temperatures.

Recently, the Casimir effect was used to increase the quality factor of a mechanical resonatorand couple two separate mechanical resonators. In addition, the Casimir effect has been utilized to realize nonlinear oscillation, quantum trapping and self-assembling. While the paradigm of Casimir effect between two objects has been extensively explored –, the Casimir force between three macroscopic objects has not been detected yet. The Casimir effect between three objects will be important in studying gravity at short distances as a metal film is often used to separate two test masses to shield electrostatic interactions –. Precision measurement of the Casimir effect has been used to search for a new force beyond the standard model. Beyond its fundamental interest, a Casimir system with three objects can open the route to realize crucial technological building blocks such as a transistor-like three-terminal device with quantum vacuum fluctuations.

### Biskyrmion States and their current-driven motion in a layered manganite [^485f803b]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The magnetic skyrmion is a topologically stable spin texture in which the constituent spins point to all the directions wrapping a sphere. Generation and control of nanometric magnetic skyrmions have large potential, for example, reduced power consumption, in spintronics device applications. Here we show the real-space observation of a biskyrmion, as defined by a molecular form of two bound skyrmions with the total topological charge of 2, realized under magnetic field applied normal to a thin plate of a bilayered manganite with centrosymmetric structure. In terms of a Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have observed a distorted-triangle lattice of biskyrmion crystal, each composed of two bound skyrmions with oppositely swirling spins (magnetic helicities). Furthermore, we demonstrate that these biskyrmions can be electrically driven with orders of magnitude lower current density (< 10(8) A m(-2)) than that for the conventional ferromagnetic domain walls.

### Directed self-assembly of a colloidal kagome lattice [^7ed72dbe]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

A challenging goal in materials chemistry and physics is spontaneously to form intended superstructures from designed building blocks. In fields such as crystal engineering and the design of porous materials, this typically involves building blocks of organic molecules, sometimes operating together with metallic ions or clusters. The translation of such ideas to nanoparticles and colloidal-sized building blocks would potentially open doors to new materials and new properties, but the pathways to achieve this goal are still undetermined. Here we show how colloidal spheres can be induced to self-assemble into a complex predetermined colloidal crystal-in this case a colloidal kagome lattice-through decoration of their surfaces with a simple pattern of hydrophobic domains. The building blocks are simple micrometre-sized spheres with interactions (electrostatic repulsion in the middle, hydrophobic attraction at the poles, which we call 'triblock Janus') that are also simple, but the self-assembly of the spheres into an open kagome structure contrasts with previously known close-packed periodic arrangements of spheres. This open network is of interest for several theoretical reasons. With a view to possible enhanced functionality, the resulting lattice structure possesses two families of pores, one that is hydrophobic on the rims of the pores and another that is hydrophilic. This strategy of 'convergent' self-assembly from easily fabricated colloidal building blocks encodes the target supracolloidal architecture, not in localized attractive spots but instead in large redundantly attractive regions, and can be extended to form other supracolloidal networks.

The number of reports cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, or frequency of problems associated with devices.  Confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely. adjudicated by a blinded core laboratory.

This result demonstrates that the PulseRider is able to successfully assist in retaining neurovascular embolization coils within the aneurysm sac for unruptured, wide-necked, intracranial aneurysms originating on or near a vessel bifurcation of the basilar tip or carotid. data including the Case Report Forms, the results generally support that the risks of the PulseRider are similar to marketed HDE neurovascular stents and the majority of patients in the study were able to achieve occlusion of their unruptured, wide-necked, intracranial aneurysm originating on or.

### MRI-based transfer function determination through the transfer matrix by jointly fitting the incident and scatteredfield [^f05bdf1d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

For the partially insulated wire, the TM in Equation 8 depends on 10 parameters, which makes the minimization given by Equation 10 somewhat more challenging. The resulting field distribution of the fits for a phantom with a partially insulated 20‐cm wire together with the actual simulated distributions are shown in Figure 4. In the case of the insulated wire, the Pearson correlation between the current from simulation and from the fit of the field distributions is 0.9752 with a mean relative error over the distribution of 2.36% (which is an underestimation of the deviation in the fitted current that is maximal at the transition between the insulated and bare regions). Still, the TFs that follow from the fit are in good agreement with the reference TF for all the trajectories.

The results shown in Figures 3 and 4, and the supplementary figures demonstrate that the model given by Equations 8 and 9 describes the fields adequately. The c k parameters that result from fitting the simulated distributions are the parameters describing the TMs, and thereby the TFs for the bare and partially insulated wire. These TMs are compared to the TMs determined with simulations of subsequently repositioned incident electric fields generated with thin plane wave boxes. The TMs that result from these simulations are considered the ground‐truth reference. For the wires aligned with the z‐axis, the TMs that result from the fit of the field are shown in Figure 5 together with the ground‐truth TM. The first row of the TM is the TF and is shown in the third column of Figure 5. This TF and the TFs that result from the other in silica experiments together with the directly simulated reference are shown in Figure 6.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^3afb239e]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading of recommendations — the grading system encompasses two dimensions: balance of benefits to harms, risks, or burdens (including confidence in effect estimates) and the level of evidence supporting the recommendation; recommendations are strong when benefits clearly outweigh harms or vice versa and may include a strong negative recommendation; strong recommendations (Grade 1) use the language "we recommend", whereas when benefits and harms are closely balanced and further research could change the direction or strength, it is considered weak and statements read, "we suggest"; when benefits clearly outweigh harms most patients would choose the intervention and the recommendation is Grade 1, but with considerable variability in preferences recommendations are weaker, ie, Grade 2; the other dimension reflects the quality of the body of evidence scored A, B, or C.

### Three regimes of extrasolar planet radius inferred from host star metallicities [^ea0b45ef]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Approximately half of the extrasolar planets (exoplanets) with radii less than four Earth radii are in orbits with short periods. Despite their sheer abundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. The available evidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rocky planets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thick hydrogen and helium gas envelopes. Here we report the metallicities (that is, the abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanet candidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into three populations defined by statistically distinct (∼4.5σ) metallicity regions. We interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes of terrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 Earth radii), gas dwarf planets with rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 Earth radii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 Earth radii). These transitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates, implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solids inventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating the structure of planetary systems.

### Precise surface patches on active particles of arbitrary shape through microstenciling [^385bef56]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Active particles, which locally dissipate energy from their environment to function, are useful across disciplines given their dynamic and programmable behaviors. Altering particle shape or surface asymmetry has led to advancements in controlled locomotion or collective behavior for diverse applications such as microrobotics or biomedicine. However, making arbitrary active particles of precise shape and surface composition remains a significant challenge due to limitations in conventional fabrication methods. This paper introduces a fabrication technique that combines two-photon lithography with sacrificial stencil masking to deposit arbitrary metallic patches onto particles of any shape with a limit of resolution as low as 0.2µm. Using this method, we demonstrate three varieties of active particles displaying nonconventional dynamics: electrokinetic active spheres with tunable three-dimensional motions, catalytic microdiscs with chiral axial spinning, and steric magnetic particles forming self-limiting microrobots. Overall, this high-resolution microstenciling technique offers a versatile strategy to create well-defined active particles and microrobots for numerous practical uses.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^afa0bb24]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Extension cord standards — Code and industry requirements specify that many cord-connected appliances should be equipped with polarized grounding plugs, and such electrical products should only be used with polarized or grounded extension cords; polarized plugs can only be inserted one way into the outlet because one blade is slightly wider than the other. Voluntary industry safety standards, including those of Underwriters' Laboratory (UL), require that general-use extension cords have safety closures, warning labels, rating information about the electrical current, and other protective features. UL-listed extension cords must be constructed with 16-gauge or larger wire or be equipped with integral fuses; the 16-gauge wire is rated to carry 13 amperes (up to 1,560 watts), whereas formerly used 18-gauge cords were rated for 10 amperes (up to 1,200 watts).

### Heterogeneous encoding of temporal stimuli in the cerebellar cortex [^329b207b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Each experimental training session lasted for 80 trials, with an inter-trial interval sampled from a discretized truncated exponential function (tau = 4s). Mice were considered trained when the CR percentage values saturated to or exceeded a threshold of approximately 40% (Supplementary Fig. 2). After performance metrics stabilized, mice underwent a surgical craniotomy and chamber placement.

On each trial, the LEDs (Light) were active for 70 ms, followed by the interstimulus interval (ISI), after which the airpuff was administered for 70 ms, resulting in reflexive eye closure. The ISI was determined based on the time interval distribution condition. For the narrow condition, the ISI was 350 ms, whereas in the wide distribution, it was sampled with uniform probability from a discrete distribution (200, 275, 350, 425, and 500 ms), which is shown to maximize training efficiency. At the start of each session, two airpuff-only trials were administered to compute and calibrate the baseline eye closure by calculating the change in pixel value during each frame in the region of interest. This value was used to normalize subsequent eyeblink responses. Mice were monitored at all times during training and were given a time-out if squinting or extended eye closure was detected. Sessions also consisted of paired and test trials, where the airpuff was omitted.

Quantification of eyeblink metrics

Eyeblink responses within the session were normalized to the reflexive response evoked by the airpuff either in absence of the light stimulus on airpuff-only trials or on paired trials. A predictive response was detected if the eyeblink trace velocity increased beyond a threshold and amplitude that exceeded thrice the baseline standard deviation before the light presentation across all trials within a session. Percentage of the predictive response within a session was computed as the number of trials where such a response was detected against the total number of trials within a session. Response amplitude was computed as the maximum eye closure of the predictive component after light onset.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^5f354c75]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### Physical networks as network-of-networks [^b4137ec0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Physical networks are made of nodes and links that are physical objects embedded in a geometric space. Understanding how the mutual volume exclusion between these elements affects the structure and function of physical networks calls for a suitable generalization of network theory. Here, we introduce a network-of-networks framework where we describe the shape of each extended physical node as a network embedded in space and these networks are bound together by physical links. Relying on this representation, we introduce a minimal model of network growth and we show for a general class of physical networks that volume exclusion induces heterogeneity in both node volume and degree, with the two becoming correlated. These emergent properties strongly affect the dynamics on physical networks: by calculating their Laplacian spectrum as a function of the coupling strength between the nodes we show that degree-volume correlations suppress the role of hubs as early spreaders in diffusive dynamics. We apply the network-of-networks framework to describe several real systems and find properties analog to the minimal model networks. The prevalence of these properties points towards general growth mechanisms that do not depend on the specifics of the systems.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Structured multimaterial filaments for 3D printing of optoelectronics [^7bebda0e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Simultaneous 3D printing of disparate materials; metals, polymers and semiconductors with device quality interfaces and at high resolution remains challenging. Moreover, the precise placement of discrete and continuous domains to enable both device performance and electrical connectivity poses barriers to current high-speed 3D-printing approaches. Here, we report filaments with disparate materials arranged in elaborate microstructures, combined with an external adhesion promoter, to enable a wide range of topological outcomes and device-quality interfaces in 3D printed media. Filaments, structured towards light-detection, are printed into fully-connected 3D serpentine and spherical sensors capable of spatially resolving light at micron resolution across its entire centimeter-scale surface. 0-dimensional metallic microspheres generate light-emitting filaments that are printed into hierarchical 3D objects dotted with electroluminescent pixels at high device resolution of 55µm not restricted by surface tension effects. Structured multimaterial filaments provides a path towards custom three-dimensional functional devices not realizable by existing approaches.

### An earth-mass planet orbiting α centauri B [^74292165]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Exoplanets down to the size of Earth have been found, but not in the habitable zone — that is, at a distance from the parent star at which water, if present, would be liquid. There are planets in the habitable zone of stars cooler than our Sun, but for reasons such as tidal locking and strong stellar activity, they are unlikely to harbour water-carbon life as we know it. The detection of a habitable Earth-mass planet orbiting a star similar to our Sun is extremely difficult, because such a signal is overwhelmed by stellar perturbations. Here we report the detection of an Earth-mass planet orbiting our neighbour star α Centauri B, a member of the closest stellar system to the Sun. The planet has an orbital period of 3.236 days and is about 0.04 astronomical units from the star (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance).

### Mouse lens stiffness measurements [^16c9f688]. Experimental Eye Research (2010). Low credibility.

Presbyopia is a gradual loss of accommodation with age. Various studies have shown that an age-related increase in lens stiffness may be one factor involved. Lens stiffness has previously been measured using lens spinning experiments, resistance to conical probe penetration and dynamic mechanical analysis. In the current study, two different techniques have been used to evaluate the stiffness of isolated mouse lenses. In the first method, compressive forces were applied to mouse lenses using microscope cover-slips to exert incremental forces on the lens. Lens images were captured for analysis of change in diameter. In the second method, a fully automated squeezer system with an actuator, electronic scale and a CCD camera was used to apply incremental compressive forces to the lenses. The actuator exerted forces comparable to those exerted by cover-slips. Force and actuator displacement data together with images of the lenses as they were compressed were captured. Images were analyzed for change in lens diameter on application of force and also with actuator displacement. Lenses from 19 young male mice (4-weeks old) and 28 male retired breeders (7–9 months old) were tested. Lenses were used immediately after sacrificing the mice and extracting the lenses. The lenses from the older male mice were stiffer compared to the lenses from the younger male mice. This was determined by comparing the average change in lens diameter at various force values used. The two methods provide a good indication of the stiffness properties of mouse lenses.

### Grid cells accurately track movement during path integration-based navigation despite switching reference frames [^fec2a94b]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

The temporal dynamics of anchoring strength as a function of time rise sharply after encountering the lever and peaking at around 1.6 s (Supplementary Fig. 14). It is important to note that there might be some variability between the moment we consider that the mouse reached the lever and the moment that the mouse perceived the lever. Unfortunately, we could not analyze single trials to determine if anchoring occurs rapidly at varying times per trial (our hypothesis) or develops over 1–2 s.

Lever-centered firing rate analysis

We calculated firing rate maps in the lever reference frame. To obtain the position of the animal relative to the lever position, we subtracted the position of the lever from the animal's position. Firing rate maps were then generated using a procedure similar to that of standard firing rate maps but the bin size varied (standard maps bin size, 3 × 3 cm; lever reference frame maps bin size, 1 × 1 cm) and only data points when the mouse was within a radius of 18 cm from the center of the lever were included. When these maps were compared to room referenced maps, room referenced maps were calculated using the same time intervals as lever-referenced maps. To calculate the map stability during light or dark trials, the trials were divided into two equally sized groups of trials, two firing rate maps were generated, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the two firing rate maps.

Directional selectivity around the lever was estimated by calculating the firing rate of a neuron as a function of the direction of the mouse relative to the center of the lever. The direction of the mouse around the lever was defined as the direction of a vector with the origin at the center of the lever and pointing toward the mouse. The firing rate histogram had a bin size of 10°, and only data when the mouse was within a radius of 18 cm from the lever were included. The directional selectivity was defined as the MVL of this histogram. To calculate the MVL, a 2D vector was obtained for each histogram bin by multiplying the cosine and sine of the angle associated with a bin by the firing rate of the same bin. The 2D vectors were summed and divided by the sum of the firing rate in the histogram. The length of the resultant vector was the MVL. To estimate chance levels, directional selectivity was calculated after shifting the position data relative to the spike trains by a random amount (minimum shift of 20 s). This procedure was repeated 100 times, and the median was taken.

### Characterization of extrasolar terrestrial planets from diurnal photometric variability [^83f46e64]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The detection of massive planets orbiting nearby stars has become almost routine, but current techniques are as yet unable to detect terrestrial planets with masses comparable to the Earth's. Future space-based observatories to detect Earth-like planets are being planned. Terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones of stars-where planetary surface conditions are compatible with the presence of liquid water-are of enormous interest because they might have global environments similar to Earth's and even harbour life. The light scattered by such a planet will vary in intensity and colour as the planet rotates; the resulting light curve will contain information about the planet's surface and atmospheric properties. Here we report a model that predicts features that should be discernible in the light curve obtained by low-precision photometry. For extrasolar planets similar to Earth, we expect daily flux variations of up to hundreds of per cent, depending sensitively on ice and cloud cover as well as seasonal variations. This suggests that the meteorological variability, composition of the surface (for example, ocean versus land fraction) and rotation period of an Earth-like planet could be derived from photometric observations. Even signatures of Earth-like plant life could be constrained or possibly, with further study, even uniquely determined.

### Ginzburg-landau-type theory of spin superconductivity [^2b8bf592]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Spin superconductivity is a recently proposed analogue of conventional charge superconductivity, in which spin currents flow without dissipation but charge currents do not. Here we derive a universal framework for describing the properties of a spin superconductor along similar lines to the Ginzburg-Landau equations that describe conventional superconductors, and show that the second of these Ginzburg-Landau-type equations is equivalent to a generalized London equation. Just as the GL equations enabled researchers to explore the behaviour of charge superconductors, our Ginzburg-Landau-type equations enable us to make a number of non-trivial predictions about the potential behaviour of putative spin superconductor. They enable us to calculate the super spin current in a spin superconductor under a uniform electric field or that induced by a thin conducting wire. Moreover, they allow us to predict the emergence of new phenomena, including the spin-current Josephson effect in which a time-independent magnetic field induces a time-dependent spin current.

### Observation of bose-einstein condensates in an earth-orbiting research lab [^cda07e97]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic world, where low mass and momentum reveal a natural wave-particle duality. Magnifying quantum behaviour to macroscopic scales is a major strength of the technique of cooling and trapping atomic gases, in which low momentum is engineered through extremely low temperatures. Advances in this field have achieved such precise control over atomic systems that gravity, often negligible when considering individual atoms, has emerged as a substantial obstacle. In particular, although weaker trapping fields would allow access to lower temperatures 1,2, gravity empties atom traps that are too weak. Additionally, inertial sensors based on cold atoms could reach better sensitivities if the free-fall time of the atoms after release from the trap could be made longer 3. Planetary orbit, specifically the condition of perpetual free-fall, offers to lift cold-atom studies beyond such terrestrial limitations. Here we report production of rubidium Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in an Earth-orbiting research laboratory, the Cold Atom Lab. We observe subnanokelvin BECs in weak trapping potentials with free-expansion times extending beyond one second, providing an initial demonstration of the advantages offered by a microgravity environment for cold-atom experiments and verifying the successful operation of this facility. With routine BEC production, continuing operations will support long-term investigations of trap topologies unique to microgravity 4,5, atom-laser sources 6, few-body physics 7,8 and pathfinding techniques for atom-wave interferometry 9–12.

Meta-analyses by definition are a subtype of systematic review intended to quantitatively assess the strength of evidence present on an intervention or treatment. Such analyses may use individual-level data or aggregate data to produce a point estimate of an effect, also known as the combined effect, and measure precision of the calculated estimate. The current article will review several important considerations during the analytic phase of a meta-analysis, including selection of effect estimators, heterogeneity and various sub-types of meta-analytic approaches.

### Closed platysmotomy: a new procedure for the treatment of platysma bands without skin dissection [^8b4052af]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

On the external body of the tube are two rings the surgeon uses to hold the platysmotome. While the shaft turns, the steel wire wraps around its tip, firmly and progressively tightening the loop that cuts the muscle (Figs. 1 a–c, 2 a–g).

Fig. 1
(a – c) The platysmotome is a hollow metal cylinder with a solid cylinder inside that can be turned by a handle at the lower end. On the opposite end, a semicircular metal plate with a 1.5-mm hole in the center is attached to the cylinder, which envelops the turning rod. Two metal rings are attached to the external cylinder, by which the surgeon holds onto the device. Both ends of the wire, looped around the platysma band, are threaded through the central hole of the semicircular plate. They then are inserted separately through each hole in the solid cylinder and knotted. When the handle is turned, the wire loop is wrapped around the end of the movable rod, gradually pulling the loop, which cuts the muscle and then emerges from the skin. The simplified platysmotome (d, e) consists of a 2-cm-diameter metal plate with a central 1.5-mm hole soldered to a 12-cm rod at an angle of 140º (f, g). The two ends of the wire, after encircling the platysma band (represented in the figure by a tube of silicone), pass through the hole of the plate, which is resting against the patient's skin. (h) The two ends of the wire are secured by a strong needleholder, which turns around itself. Its tail is a lever the surgeon uses to tighten it. The steel wire is wrapped around the end of the needleholder. (i) The loop is tightened around the muscular band, cutting it before surfacing through the point-like needle hole

### Recommendations for tumor mutational burden assay validation and reporting: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, college of American pathologists, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer [^34f979c3]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Tumor mutational burden (TMB) assay validation — Recommendation 2: Laboratories Should Validate and Report the Size and Describe the Genomic Regions (ie, Exons, Introns, and Intergenic Regions) Used for TMB Calculation. The published literature provides insufficient evidence to set an ideal extent of genomic sequence; accuracy of TMB estimation correlates directly with extent of genomic sequencing, with small panels causing the most error and minimal error with whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. Among publications that reported size, the extent analyzed ranged from < 0.5 to > 10 Mb, with a clear modal size of 1 to 2 Mb (approximately 60% of methods). Given that assay size influences TMB calculation accuracy, laboratories should validate and report the genomic territory included in the TMB analysis, and genomic regions associated with intron baits or single-nucleotide polymorphism regions used to normalize copy number assessment should not include the genomic regions associated with these baits, unless those laboratories are also analyzing SNVs in these regions and including them in the TMB calculation.
