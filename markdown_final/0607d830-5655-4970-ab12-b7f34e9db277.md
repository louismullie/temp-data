## Question

Is Augmentin appropriate for uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) is appropriate for urinary tract infections, and if so, when and how it should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of UTI (uncomplicated cystitis, complicated UTI, pyelonephritis). Then, I should verify what the FDA label actually says about indications and dosing. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions and comparative efficacy data. After that, I need to check resistance patterns and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation with dosing and caveats, including special populations and renal impairment considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because appropriateness hinges on it; uncomplicated cystitis in healthy, nonpregnant women is managed differently than complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, and this distinction drives both agent selection and duration of therapy, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring to those categories before judging Augmentin's role.

> I will now examine the FDA labeling to verify indications and dosing; the current label indicates Augmentin for UTIs caused by beta-lactamase–producing E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, with adult dosing options including 500/125 mg every 8 hours or 875/125 mg every 12 hours for 7–10 days, and pediatric dosing by weight-based formulations, which confirms labeled use for UTIs but does not by itself establish first-line status or comparative effectiveness [^117XZ7UZ] [^116E51Jq] [^116DKHYK] [^113138dX] [^117WnXDH] [^112qu5J8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review guideline positions next. IDSA guidance for complicated UTI suggests third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones as preferred empiric options, and lists amoxicillin-clavulanate as a less well-studied alternative for select oral scenarios, which signals it is not a preferred empiric agent for cUTI even though it remains an option in defined circumstances [^112xZtgT] [^1144icsw] [^117GrFR3].

> For uncomplicated cystitis, I need to check comparative efficacy; high-quality evidence and guidelines consistently show nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX (where resistance is low), and fosfomycin as preferred first-line therapies, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate demonstrates inferior clinical and microbiologic cure compared with fluoroquinolones and is not recommended as initial therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women, reflecting both lower efficacy and broader collateral damage concerns [^117VnG78] [^115JHQBP] [^117CdGvW] [^116D2UjH].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance landscape because that materially affects empiric appropriateness; contemporary data show notable nonsusceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate among E. coli isolates in both adults and children, and stewardship guidance emphasizes tailoring empiric choices to local resistance patterns and prior culture history, reinforcing caution with empiric Augmentin use where resistance is elevated or prior exposure suggests higher risk of resistance [^111fA58S] [^112sRtE6] [^116v63pm] [^111s2fcA].

> I should double-check pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations; Augmentin achieves adequate urinary concentrations and has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible and some intermediately resistant E. coli in volunteer studies, but its clinical performance still lags behind standard first-line agents for uncomplicated cystitis, and the clavulanate component adds GI toxicity and C. difficile risk without offsetting efficacy advantages in most UTI presentations [^113ZVWG8] [^117VnG78] [^113tqqwp].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in pregnancy, amoxicillin-clavulanate is sometimes used when first-line agents are unsuitable, but it is not a preferred empiric choice and should be guided by culture and susceptibility when possible, whereas in pediatrics, AAP guidance supports oral beta-lactams including amoxicillin-clavulanate for febrile UTIs with dosing adjustments, and a recent randomized trial suggests a 5-day course may be noninferior to 10 days in selected children, though stewardship and local resistance data should still guide selection [^113tLEJ9] [^115TFWgH] [^111jvLWg] [^1148JM6o].

> Next, I should review renal impairment and safety; because both components are renally cleared, dose adjustments are generally required in significant renal dysfunction, and elderly patients may have higher adverse event risk, so I need to ensure creatinine clearance–based dosing and monitoring are addressed before recommending Augmentin in those settings [^113Ka5xb] [^114jJgrc].

> But wait, what if the isolate is known to be susceptible and beta-lactamase–producing; I should confirm the label's limitation of use clause, which advises against using Augmentin when the organism is susceptible to amoxicillin alone, meaning plain amoxicillin should be preferred in that scenario to minimize unnecessary clavulanate exposure and adverse effects, which is a key stewardship point [^117XZ7UZ] [^1125KXzg].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my recommendation aligns with evidence and stewardship: Augmentin is not a first-line agent for uncomplicated cystitis due to inferior efficacy and higher collateral damage, but it remains an acceptable alternative for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis when guided by culture, local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, or when first-line agents are contraindicated, with adult dosing commonly 500/125 mg every 8 hours or 875/125 mg every 12 hours for 7–10 days and pediatric dosing by weight-based formulations, always reassessing therapy once susceptibilities return [^117VnG78] [^112xZtgT] [^1144icsw] [^111K6eJw] [^111VugYb] [^113138dX] [^117WnXDH] [^112qu5J8] [^116DKHYK].

---

Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) is **appropriate for UTIs** when the pathogen is susceptible and beta-lactamase–producing, especially in complicated infections or when first-line agents are unsuitable [^117XZ7UZ] [^112xZtgT]. It is **not first-line for uncomplicated cystitis** because of lower efficacy and higher adverse effects compared with nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin [^117VnG78] [^112EpD5s]. Use Augmentin for 5–7 days in uncomplicated cases and 10–14 days for complicated infections or pyelonephritis, adjusting for renal function and local resistance patterns [^111K6eJw] [^1147MGB4] [^113Ka5xb].

---

## Indications and clinical guidelines

Augmentin is indicated for UTIs caused by **beta-lactamase–producing E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter** species [^117XZ7UZ]. Guidelines recommend it for complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis, especially when beta-lactamase production is suspected or confirmed [^112xZtgT] [^1144icsw]. It is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for uncomplicated cystitis because of lower efficacy and higher adverse effects than nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin [^117VnG78] [^117CdGvW].

---

## Efficacy of Augmentin in treating UTIs

Augmentin's efficacy depends on the **infection type and pathogen susceptibility**:

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: Lower clinical and microbiological cure rates than first-line agents; not recommended as initial therapy [^116D2UjH] [^117CdGvW].
- **Complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis**: Effective when pathogens are susceptible; comparable to other beta-lactams in clinical trials [^116DKHYK] [^1137Avru].
- **Pediatric UTIs**: Effective for febrile UTIs; short-course regimens (5 days) are noninferior to 10 days in recent trials [^1148JM6o].

---

## Recommended dosage and duration of therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | 250/125 mg PO TID or 500/125 mg PO BID | 3–7 days [^115Ybnu1] [^111VugYb] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | 500/125 mg PO TID or 875/125 mg PO BID | 10–14 days [^111K6eJw] [^1147MGB4] |
| Pediatric patients (≥ 3 months) | 40–45 mg/kg/day divided BID or TID | 7–14 days [^113138dX] [^117WnXDH] |

---

Renal function should be assessed and doses adjusted in **impaired renal function** to avoid accumulation and adverse effects [^113Ka5xb] [^114jJgrc].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Augmentin is **generally well tolerated**, but adverse effects are more frequent than with some first-line UTI agents:

- **Common adverse effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and rash [^116E51Jq].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare hepatotoxicity, cholestatic jaundice, and Clostridioides difficile infection [^113tqqwp].
- **Comparison with other antibiotics**: Higher adverse event rates than nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; similar to some fluoroquinolones [^112EpD5s].

---

## Resistance patterns and susceptibility

Resistance among uropathogens — particularly E. coli — significantly affects Augmentin's effectiveness. Amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance in E. coli is **approximately 27–29%** globally, with higher rates in some regions [^114R1aPb] [^111fA58S]. Susceptibility testing is essential to guide therapy, especially in complicated infections or treatment failures [^117H4oaD].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Efficacy** | **Adverse effects** | **Resistance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Augmentin | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| Nitrofurantoin | High | Low | Low |
| TMP-SMX | High | Moderate | Moderate |
| Fosfomycin | High | Low | Low |
| Fluoroquinolones | High | Moderate | Moderate |

---

Augmentin is **less effective than first-line agents** for uncomplicated cystitis and has higher adverse effects, limiting its use [^117VnG78] [^112EpD5s].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Generally considered safe; preferred over fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.
- **Pediatric patients**: Effective for febrile UTIs; dosing should be weight-based and adjusted for renal function [^115TFWgH] [^113Ka5xb].
- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment required; monitor renal function and adverse effects [^113Ka5xb] [^114jJgrc].

---

Augmentin is **appropriate for UTIs** when the pathogen is susceptible and beta-lactamase–producing, particularly in complicated infections or when first-line agents are unsuitable. It is **not first-line for uncomplicated cystitis** because of lower efficacy and higher adverse effects compared with nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin [^117VnG78] [^112EpD5s].

14.1 Lower Respiratory Tract and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections

Data from 2 pivotal trials in 1,191 patients treated for either lower respiratory tract infections or complicated urinary tract infections compared a regimen of 875 mg/125 mg tablets of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium every 12 hours to 500 mg/125 mg tablets of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium dosed every 8 hours (584 and 607 patients, respectively). Comparable efficacy was demonstrated between the every 12 hours and every 8 hours dosing regimens. There was no significant difference in the percentage of adverse events in each group. The most frequently reported adverse event was diarrhea; incidence rates were similar for the 875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours and 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours dosing regimens (15% and 14%, respectively); however, there was a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05) in rates of severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea between the regimens: 1% for 875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours regimen versus 2% for the 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours regimen.

In one of these pivotal trials, patients with either pyelonephritis (n equals 361) or a complicated urinary tract infection (i.e., patients with abnormalities of the urinary tract that predispose to relapse of bacteriuria following eradication, n equals 268) were randomized (1:1) to receive either 875 mg/125mg tablets of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours (n equals 308) or 500 mg/125 mg tablets of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours (n equals 321).

The number of bacteriologically evaluable patients was comparable between the two dosing regimens. AUGMENTIN produced comparable bacteriological success rates in patients assessed 2 to 4 days immediately following end of therapy. The bacteriologic efficacy rates were comparable at one of the follow‑up visits (5 to 9 days post‑therapy) and at a late post‑therapy visit (in the majority of cases, this was 2 to 4 weeks post-therapy), as seen in Table 8.

Table 8: Bacteriologic efficacy rates for AUGMENTIN

As noted before, though there was no significant difference in the percentage of adverse events in each group, there was a statistically significant difference in rates of severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea between the regimens.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Data from 2 pivotal studies in 1,191 patients treated for either
lower respiratory tract infections or complicated urinary tract infections
compared a regimen of 875-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours to 500-mg
tablets of AUGMENTIN dosed every 8 hours (584 and 607 patients, respectively).
Comparable efficacy was demonstrated between the every 12 hours and every 8
hours dosing regimens. There was no significant difference in the percentage of
adverse events in each group. The most frequently reported adverse event was
diarrhea; incidence rates were similar for the 875-mg every 12 hours and 500-mg
every 8 hours dosing regimens (14.9% and 14.3%, respectively); however, there
was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in rates of severe diarrhea or withdrawals
with diarrhea between the regimens: 1.0% for 875-mg every 12 hours dosing versus
2.5% for the 500-mg every 8 hours dosing.

In 1 of these pivotal studies, 629 patients with either pyelonephritis or a
complicated urinary tract infection (i.e., patients with abnormalities of the
urinary tract that predispose to relapse of bacteriuria following eradication)
were randomized to receive either 875-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or
500-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours in the following distribution:

The number of bacteriologically evaluable patients was comparable between the
2 dosing regimens. AUGMENTIN produced comparable bacteriological success rates
in patients assessed 2 to 4 days immediately following end of therapy. The
bacteriologic efficacy rates were comparable at 1 of the follow-up visits (5 to
9 days post-therapy) and at a late post-therapy visit (in the majority of cases,
this was 2 to 4 weeks post-therapy), as seen in the table below:

As noted before, though there was no significant difference in the percentage
of adverse events in each group, there was a statistically significant
difference in rates of severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea between the
regimens.

The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in AUGMENTIN protects
amoxicillin from degradation by β-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the
antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant
to amoxicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. Thus, AUGMENTIN possesses the
properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a β-lactamase inhibitor.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most strains
of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as
described in INDICATIONS AND USAGE.

Staphylococcus aureus (β-lactamase and
non−β-lactamase−producing)c

cStaphylococci which are resistant to
methicillin/oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid.

Enterobacter species (Although most
strains of Enterobacter species are resistant in
vitro, clinical efficacy has been demonstrated with AUGMENTIN in urinary tract
infections caused by these organisms.)

Escherichia coli (β-lactamase and
non−β-lactamase−producing)

Haemophilus influenzae (β-lactamase and
non−β-lactamase−producing)

Klebsiella species (All known strains are
β-lactamase−producing.)

Moraxella catarrhalis (β-lactamase and
non−β-lactamase−producing)

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) of 2 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae d; MICs of
0.06 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MICs of 4 mcg/mL or less against
most (≥ 90%) strains of staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria; and MICs of
8 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of other listed organisms.
However, with the exception of organisms shown to respond to amoxicillin alone,
the safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating clinical
infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and
well-controlled clinical trials.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of AUGMENTIN, 32% were greater than or equal to 65 years old, and 14% were greater than or equal to 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR less than 30 mL/min). See Patients with Renal Impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by
susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed
below:

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of H. influenzae and M.
catarrhalis.

Otitis Media

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of H. influenzae and M.
catarrhalis.

Sinusitis

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of H. influenzae and M.
catarrhalis.

Skin and Skin Structure Infections

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp.

Urinary Tract Infections

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp.

While AUGMENTIN is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections
caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with
AUGMENTIN due to its amoxicillin content; therefore, mixed infections caused by
ampicillin-susceptible organisms and β-lactamase−producing organisms susceptible
to AUGMENTIN should not require the addition of another antibiotic. Because
amoxicillin has greater in vitro activity against S.
pneumoniae than does ampicillin or penicillin, the majority of S. pneumoniae strains with intermediate susceptibility to
ampicillin or penicillin are fully susceptible to amoxicillin and AUGMENTIN.
(See Microbiology.)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the
effectiveness of AUGMENTIN and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN should be
used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected
to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility
information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying
antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and
susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Bacteriological studies, to determine the causative organisms and their
susceptibility to AUGMENTIN, should be performed together with any indicated

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^113tqqwp]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amoxicillin / clavulanate PO (also known as Augmentin):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including amoxicillin/clavulanate, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Enterocolitis**: use caution in all patients, especially in pediatric patients.
- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as chewable tablets and powder for oral solution contain phenylalanine.
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amoxicillin/clavulanate has been associated with an increased risk of hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Monitor liver function in patients with hepatic impairment.

### Sulopenem versus amoxicillin / clavulanate for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^115ZBWec]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections are becoming less reliably effective owing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sulopenem/probenecid for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial of 5 days of sulopenem versus amoxicillin/clavulanate for women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. The primary end point was overall success, defined as combined clinical cure and microbiologic eradication by day 12, evaluated in the microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population, which comprised all randomly assigned patients who received any trial medication and had a positive urine culture with 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/ml or more of an Enterobacterales uropathogen (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species).

Results

A total of 2222 patients were enrolled, and the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 35–62 years). Ninety-one (9.2%) patients in the primary population (microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population), the combined population of patients with a positive baseline urine culture and without regard to amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility, had a baseline pathogen resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics. Overall success in the microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population occurred in 318 of 522 (60.9%) participants treated with sulopenem versus 260 of 468 (55.6%) participants treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.8 to 11.5), meeting criteria for noninferiority. In the primary population with a baseline uropathogen susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, success occurred in 296 of 480 (61.7%) participants treated with sulopenem versus 243 of 442 (55.0%) participants treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 13.0). In the primary population with a baseline uropathogen not susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, success occurred in 22 of 42 (52.4%) patients treated with sulopenem versus 17 of 25 (68.0%) patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, -15.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -37.5 to 9.1]. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred more frequently with sulopenem compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate, including diarrhea (8.1% vs. 4.1%), nausea (4.3% vs. 2.9%), and headache (2.2% vs. 1.5%).

Conclusions

Sulopenem was noninferior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of adult women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but was associated with more frequent mild adverse events. (Funded by Iterum Therapeutics; REASSURE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05584657.).

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^114jJgrc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, 32% were greater than or equal to 65 years old, and 14% were greater than or equal to 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR less than 30 mL/min). See Patients with Renal Impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections: network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112ZTKy5]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacies and adverse effects of different antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) have been studied by standard meta-analytic methods using pairwise direct comparisons of antimicrobial treatments: the effects of one treatment are compared to those of either another treatment or placebo. However, for clinical decisions, we need to know the effectiveness of each possible treatment in comparison with all relevant alternatives, not with just one.

Objectives

To compare the efficacies and adverse effects of all relevant antibiotics for UTI treatment simultaneously by performing a network meta-analysis using direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

Methods

Using logistic regression analysis, we performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after 1999 that compared different oral antibiotic or placebo regimens for UTI treatment in general practice or outpatient settings. We looked at five binary outcomes: early clinical, early bacteriological, late clinical and late bacteriological outcomes, as well as adverse effects. Consequently, a ranking of the antibiotic regimens could be composed.

Results

Using a network structure, we could compare and rank nine treatments from 10 studies. Overall, ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin appeared the most effective treatments, and amoxicillin-clavulanate appeared the least effective treatment. In terms of adverse effects, there were no significant differences.

Discussion

Network meta-analysis shows some clear efficacy differences between different antibiotic treatments for UTI in women. It provides a useful tool for clinical decision making in everyday practice. Moreover, the method can be used for meta-analyses of RCTs across primary care and beyond.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^116DKHYK]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

### Antibiotic utilization and efficacy associated with treating pediatric urinary tract infections in Texas medicaid patients in the first year of life [^111s3ek6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Historically, amoxicillin (Amoxil) has been used as a first-line agent to treat pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, emerging antibiotic resistance in urinary pathogens has led to broader treatment options, such as cefdinir (Omnicef). This shift in prescribing practices is predicted to vary among place of service and gender due to differing institutional protocols and antimicrobial stewardship practices.

Objective

This study aimed to describe the antibiotic utilization patterns associated with treating pediatric UTIs in Texas Medicaid patients and to assess the real-world efficacy of the antibiotics that were prescribed.

Methods

Texas Medicaid prescription and medical claims data for patients under 1 year of age were included in the analysis if they presented with a UTI to the healthcare practitioner's office or the emergency department (ED) and were treated with an outpatient antibiotic. Treatment efficacy was assessed by whether a patient received a second (different) antibiotic within 7 days of their initial antibiotic fill.

Results

A total of 12,795 visits met inclusion criteria; 12,561 visits included prescriptions for the top 4 antibiotics prescribed: cefdinir (50%), amoxicillin (25%), cephalexin (Keflex; 13%), and amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin; 12%). Cefdinir utilization predominated in both places of service [office (50%) and ED (55%)], and gender [males (47%) and females (52%)]. Controlling for gender and place of service, initial treatment with amoxicillin when compared with cefdinir (OR = 2.54; 95% confidence intervals: 1.84–3.54; P < 0.001) was associated with a greater rate of treatment failure.

Conclusions

In this study of Texas Medicaid patients, the widespread utilization of cefdinir may be appropriate for the empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTIs because of its low rate of treatment failure compared to other commonly used antibiotics.

### Short oral antibiotic therapy for pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: a randomized trial [^1148JM6o]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) in well-appearing children is conventionally treated with a standard 10-day course of oral antibiotic. The objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority (5% threshold) of a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate course compared with a 10-day regimen to treat fUTIs.

Methods

This is a multicenter, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. We randomly assigned children aged 3 months to 5 years with a noncomplicated fUTI to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate 50+7.12 mg/kg/day orally in 3 divided doses for 5 or 10 days. The primary end point was the recurrence of a urinary tract infection within 30 days after the completion of therapy. Secondary end points were the difference in prevalence of clinical recovery, adverse drug-related events, and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or to other antibiotics when a recurrent infection occurred.

Results

From May 2020 through September 2022, 175 children were assessed for eligibility and 142 underwent randomization. The recurrence rate within 30 days of the end of therapy was 2.8% (2/72) in the short group and 14.3% (10/70) in the standard group. The difference between the 2 groups was -11.51% (95% confidence interval, -20.54 to -2.47). The recurrence rate of fUTI within 30 days from the end of therapy was 1.4% (1/72) in the short group and 5.7% (4/70) in the standard group (95% confidence interval, -10.4 to 1.75).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a 5-day course is noninferior to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### Amoxicillin-clavulanate vs ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women: a randomized trial [^115JHQBP]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

The high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials among Escherichia coli causing acute cystitis in women has led to increased use of alternative antibiotics. One such antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate, has not been well studied.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate to that of a 3-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute cystitis in women. The primary study hypothesis was that the amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin treatment groups would differ in clinical cure.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Randomized, single-blind treatment trial of 370 women, aged 18 to 45 years, with symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis and a urine culture with at least 10² colony-forming units of uropathogens per milliliter from a university student health center or a health maintenance organization.

Interventions

Women were randomly assigned to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for 3 days and were followed up for 4 months.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measure was clinical cure. Secondary study outcomes of interest were microbiological cure and vaginal E coli colonization at the 2-week follow-up visit.

Results

Clinical cure was observed in 93 (58%) of 160 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 124 (77%) of 162 women treated with ciprofloxacin (P < .001). Amoxicillin-clavulanate was not as effective as ciprofloxacin even among women infected with strains susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (65 [60%] of 109 women in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group vs 114 [77%] of 149 women in the ciprofloxacin group; p = 0.004). The difference in clinical cure rates occurred almost entirely within the first 2 weeks after therapy. Microbiological cure at 2 weeks was observed in 118 (76%) of 156 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 153 (95%) of 161 women treated with ciprofloxacin (P < .001). At this visit, 45% of women in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group compared with 10% in the ciprofloxacin group had vaginal colonization with E coli (P < .001).

Conclusions

A 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate is not as effective as ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, even in women infected with susceptible strains. This difference may be due to the inferior ability of amoxicillin-clavulanate to eradicate vaginal E coli, facilitating early reinfection.

Safety

The mean (SD) duration of IV treatment was 6.1 (2.7) days and 5.7 (2.2) days in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem groups, respectively. Overall mean (SD) treatment duration (both IV and oral step-down) in the mMITT population was comparable in both treatment groups [ceftolozane/tazobactam, 10.2 (2.7) days; meropenem, 10.7 (2.1) days]. A total of 50 (70.4%) and 20 (83.3%) participants transitioned to optional oral step-down therapy in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem groups, for a mean (SD) duration of 5.8 (1.72) days and 6.0 (1.5) days, respectively. The most common oral step-down treatments (> 10% in either treatment group) were cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium‚ and cefuroxime; choice of oral step-down therapy was determined at the investigator's discretion.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and doxycycline guidance is as follows: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is not suggested for the treatment of ESBL-E cystitis, with a randomized trial comparing a 3-day amoxicillin-clavulanic regimen (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) to ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) in 370 women showing clinical cure in 58% versus 77% and higher persistent vaginal bacterial colonization in 45% versus 10%; the proportion infected with ESBL-E strains was not available and both agents were administered at dosages lower than generally suggested. The panel suggests against the use of doxycycline for ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis, citing limited urinary excretion (35%–60%) and lack of convincing data for clinical effectiveness.

### Susceptibility of Escherichia coli to the amoxycillin-clavulanate combination: which recommendations should be used to provide relevant information to clinicians? [^114whhEJ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

This study compared MIC distributions of amoxycillin-clavulanate obtained with NCCLS and French (Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie; CA-SFM) methodologies for Escherichia coli isolates from urine that were non-susceptible to amoxycillin-clavulanate by the disk diffusion method. With the NCCLS and CA-SFM methods, 74% and 13%, respectively, of these isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin-clavulanate. Therefore, the apparent relatively poor efficacy of amoxycillin-clavulanate against E. coli in French hospitals probably reflects a methodological difference rather than a localised resistance problem. This implies that amoxycillin-clavulanate could be used as an alternative to fluoroquinolones for treatment of E. coli urinary tract infections. Susceptibility tests for amoxycillin-clavulanate should be standardised worldwide.

### Urinary concentrations and bactericidal activity against amoxicillin-nonsusceptible strains of Escherichia coli with single-dose, oral, sustained-release amoxicillin / clavulanic acid: a phase I, open-label, noncomparative clinical trial in healthy volunteers [^113ZVWG8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for 5 to 6 million medical consultations in the United States each year. Worldwide, an estimated 20% to 30% of women aged 20 to 40 years have at least 1 episode of the most common type of UTI (uncomplicated cystitis) in their lifetime, with Escherichia coli being the causative pathogen in 80% of cases. Antibacterial activity in urine has been shown to be correlated with outcomes of uncomplicated cystitis.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to determine urinary concentrations and ex vivo bactericidal activity of sustained-release (SR) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg against intermediately resistant and resistant strains of E coli over 72 hours and compare them with those of a susceptible strain. This study also investigated whether urinary concentrations obtained after dosing cover E coli strains categorized as intermediately resistant and resistant based on current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) breakpoints in uncomplicated cystitis.

Methods

This Phase I, open-label, noncomparative study in healthy male volunteers was conducted at the Pharmacology Unit, Autónoma University, Madrid, Spain. Subjects received a single oral dose of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg SR. The amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs were 8/4 microg/mL (susceptible), 16/8 microg/mL (intermediately resistant), and 32/16 and 64/32 microg/mL (resistant). Urine samples were collected before (baseline; time 0) and at the following intervals: 0–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–12, 12–16, 16–24, 24–36, 36–48, 48–60, and 60–72 hours after dosing. Killing curves with urine samples were performed with initial inocula of approximately 10⁷ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and bactericidal activity (defined as > 3 log₁₀ CFU/mL and > 99.9% reduction in bacterial counts) was calculated as the difference between log₁₀ initial inoculum and log₁₀ CFU/mL after 4 hours of incubation of each sample.

Results

Twelve volunteers were included (mean [SD] age, 24.83 [5.64] years; mean [SD] height, 175.75 [7.56] cm; and mean [SD] weight, 73.55 [9.19] kg). No statistically significant differences between the activities in the 12–16-hour interval compared with baseline were found in any of the strains tested. Bactericidal activity against the susceptible and intermediately resistant strains (MICs 8/4 and 16/8 g/mL, respectively) was obtained up to 8 hours after dosing. Bactericidal activity against the resistant strains (MICs 32/16 and 64/32 microg/mL) was obtained in the 2–4-hour interval.

Conclusions

In this Phase I study in healthy volunteers, urinary concentrations after dosing with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg SR showed bactericidal activity against the amoxicillin-susceptible and intermediately resistant strains of E coli.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^1125KXzg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections in adults and pediatric patients, due to susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions listed below:

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.
Acute Bacterial Otitis Media - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.
Sinusitis - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.
Skin and Skin Structure Infections - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species.
Urinary Tract Infections - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species.

Limitations of Use

When susceptibility test results show susceptibility to amoxicillin, indicating no beta-lactamase production, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be used.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug‑resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are a combination of amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and clavulanate potassium, a beta-lactamase inhibitor indicated for treatment of the following infections in adults and pediatric patients: (1)

Lower respiratory tract infections
Acute bacterial otitis media
Sinusitis
Skin and skin structure infections
Urinary tract infections

### Interaction between antibiotic resistance, resistance genes, and treatment response for urinary tract infections in primary care [^112o6hrD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the specific patterns of resistance, we believe that the findings with wider relevance were our follow-up data on how matching empirical antibiotic to uropathogen susceptibility affects early symptom resolution, but also how this relationship was imperfect. The small proportion (27%) reporting early resolution despite not receiving empirical antibiotics was consistent with the clinical course of untreated uncomplicated cystitis, where 25% to 42% may experience resolution (4). In those given antibiotics, the "90/60" rule has been proposed, where infections due to susceptible and resistant isolates would correspondingly respond 90% and 60% of the time. In our study, 67% of treated patients with susceptible isolates and 45% of treated patients with nonsusceptible isolates reported early resolution. Our short follow-up duration may account for the lower proportions reporting symptom resolution (67/45 instead of 90/60), though interestingly, the ratio between groups appeared to be consistent with the 90/60 rule.

However, while we demonstrated the overall impact of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy on early symptom resolution, our findings also caution us about the validity of extrapolating efficacy purely based on in vitro susceptibility testing alone. In patients prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanate, symptoms appeared less likely to resolve when genotypic resistance markers were present than when they were absent. For those prescribed ciprofloxacin, early symptom resolution rates were lowest (about 50%), and outcomes did not differ significantly between patients with susceptible and nonsusceptible isolates. There were no striking differences in patients prescribed ciprofloxacin compared to those prescribed other antibiotics to account for these intriguing results. However, underdosing may have contributed to the poorer than expected response. Patients prescribed a dose of 250 mg twice a day appeared to have poorer outcomes than those given 500 mg twice a day, although this observation was likely underpowered (P = 0.095). These doses were chosen by primary care doctors and might not have represented any renal dose adjustment or adherence to professional guidelines.

Acute UTI with complicating factors — Women with rUTI who have complicating factors, such as abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, require additional vigilance in diagnosis and management. Initial empiric therapy until culture results are available to guide therapy (consider only if local resistance < 20%) can include a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), an aminopenicillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3a (parenteral), or an aminoglycoside. For empirical treatment in severe cases or initial failure, options include a fluoroquinolone (if not used for initial therapy), piperacillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3b (parenteral), or a carbapenem. Not recommended for empirical treatment are aminopenicillins (eg, ampicillin, amoxicillin, bacampicillin), TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin trometamol.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Assessment of antibiotic prescription in acute urinary tract infections in adults [^1127ujJz]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescription for urinary tract infections in several hospital emergency services and to evaluate the variability of antibiotic prescription among these services.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was carried out in the emergency services of 10 hospitals from different Spanish regions. The sample was composed of patients diagnosed with acute urinary infection, aged ≥ 14 years. A Consensus Conference, held by a panel of experts, established first-choice, second-choice and inappropriate antibiotic treatments for each type of urinary tract infection, based on the available scientific evidence. All the observed prescriptions in our study were classified according to this pattern. The main variables were: type of urinary infection, antibiotic prescription, urine culture request, comorbidity and hospital admission.

Results

A sample of 3797 acute urinary tract infections was studied. Eighty-one percent were lower urinary tract infections. The most commonly used antibiotics were ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The global percentages of first-choice, alternative-choice and inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions were: 42.4% (95% CI: 40.8–43.9), 44.1 (95% CI: 42.5–45.7) and 13.6% (95% CI: 12.5–14.7), respectively. We observed a significant variability in appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions among the participating centres (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Physicians at Spanish emergency rooms prescribe an excessive number of second-choice antibiotics for urinary tract infection treatment. There exists a high variability in antibiotic prescription among hospitals from different regions.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1144icsw]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric antibiotic selection uses a four-step approach: "Assess (1) severity of illness, (2) risk factors for resistance, (3) patient-specific considerations, and (4) if septic, consider the antibiogram". For sepsis with or without shock, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems,# piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones&" with alternatives "Novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors,+ cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an IV route, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones&" and alternatives are "Carbapenems,# newer agents (novel beta lactams-beta lactamase inhibitors,† cefiderocol, plazomicin), or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an oral route, preferred therapy is "Fluoroquinolones& or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole" with alternatives "Amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral cephalosporins (see Table 3.1)". Sepsis is described as "identified by SOFA score of 2 or higher" and screening tools "may be useful"; in step 4 choose antibiotics with susceptibilities "at least 90%" for sepsis with shock and "at least 80%" for sepsis without shock. The page also notes that "Difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens may require use of drugs not listed here (e.g., colistin); refer to IDSA Antimicrobial Resistance guidance" and that "nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are generally not appropriate choices for cUTI because they may not achieve adequate levels in renal parenchyma and blood".

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^1131GCyJ]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

### Interaction between antibiotic resistance, resistance genes, and treatment response for urinary tract infections in primary care [^116jeFDc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of ciprofloxacin is a function of peak concentration divided by MIC. Particularly in the elderly, where there is decreased renal excretion, the drug may not reach sufficient concentrations in the urine with a 250-mg twice daily prescription. A 500-mg once a day dosing regimen has been shown to deliver higher drug concentrations in the urine, and this regimen at minimum should be prescribed to optimize outcomes.

Overall, with regard to empirical therapy, the vast majority of isolates remained susceptible to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin. Both of these are recommended antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs in international guidelines (over amoxicillin-clavulanate, which is thought to have lower efficacy, more adverse effects, and broader spectrum of cover) and are viable alternatives that should be considered for Singapore. Given the levels of resistance observed (> 20%), ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole are less preferred in our setting without ordering urine cultures to guide treatment. In turn, the need for urine cultures could be guided by the risk factors highlighted in this study. Furthermore, appropriate dosing of ciprofloxacin, as discussed above, is vital to ensuring a favorable response to therapy.

Only a low proportion of isolates (< 10%) in our primary care setting carried the bla CTX-M, ampC, and qnr resistance genes, which are highly prevalent among hospitalisolates in Singapore. However, of these, 75% were not associated with hospitalization in the past 6 months, and acquisition may thus be occurring within the community. The rising prevalence of resistance, including strains carrying key resistance genes with possible clinical significance, compounded by the imperfect correlation between susceptibility testing results with actual clinical effectiveness, is likely an emerging and important issue which will increasingly complicate management of UTI in primary care settings around the world.

In the face of rapidly changing resistance profiles, strategies are urgently needed for rationalizing how best to determine guidelines for UTI treatment outside of the hospital, where there is typically no routine surveillance or follow up with patients. We argue that a robust approach may need to go beyond surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and include routine monitoring of a sample of patients for symptom resolution and possibly the use of genotypic markers of resistance.

### Reappraisal of the treatment duration of antibiotic regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult women: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 61 randomised clinical trials [^117No2kf]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Evidence from numerous randomised clinical trials suggest that shorter-term antimicrobial therapy is as effective as-and has other advantages over-longer-term antimicrobial regimens at achieving symptomatic cure for acute uncomplicated cystitis. Nevertheless, not all shorter regimens are adopted in clinical guidelines. This study was done to reappraise the treatment duration of each antibiotic in current guidelines for acute uncomplicated cystitis to investigate whether the regimen lengths of guideline approved antibiotics could be reduced.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant publications from inception of the databases until Dec 31, 2019. Only randomised clinical trials of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis that assessed antibiotic therapy and reported clinical or microbial response outcome values were included. A network meta-analysis was done and the quality of evidence of all of the included studies was rated. Clinical response was the primary outcome, defined as the complete disappearance of all baseline symptoms at the test-of-cure visit. Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes was used to compare the efficacy of each antibiotic treatment regimen directly and indirectly. This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018093529.

Findings

Overall, 61 randomised clinical trials-which included 20780 patients-were assessed in our systematic review. For the third-generation and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, a 3-day regimen had similar effect to a single-dose regimen for clinical response (risk ratio [RR] 0.994 [95% credible interval 0.939–1.052] vs 1.024 [0.974–1.083]), with moderate quality of evidence. For pivmecillinam, 5-day and 7-day regimens were similar to a 3-day regimen for clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence (RR 1.041 [0.910–1.193] for the 5-day regimen and 1.095 [0.999–1.203] for the 7-day regimen). Meanwhile, for third-generation cephalosporins and amoxicillin and clavulanate, there was no difference between single-dose and 3-day regimens, but quality of evidence supporting this conclusion was low. For second-generation quinolones and co-trimoxazole, single-dose regimen was less effective than 3-day regimen in clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence.

Interpretation

Treatment duration of the third-generation and fourth-generation quinolones and pivmecillinam could be shorter than the currently recommended regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis. For other antibiotics, shorter duration of regimens could be considered, but further research is needed because of the low quality of supporting evidence.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^113dJdf1]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTIs) are a common reason for consultation in primary care, where most suspected episodes are managed. Uncomplicated lower UTIs generally resolve quickly and many are self-limiting, but 11% of women report to have experienced at least one UTI and 3% report to have experienced three or more UTIs in the previous year. There are marked differences across four European countries in culture positivity, antibiotic prescribing and re-consultation, despite similarities in the presentation of UTI in primary care, the pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities. The high incidence of UTI and tendency to recur leads to high healthcare costs.

UTIs are the second most common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, recent national clinical guidelines recommend treatment of lower UTIs with narrow spectrum antibiotics, particularly nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim, when the risk of resistance is low (e.g. considering previous antibiotic use and previous urine culture and sensitivity results). Amoxicillin or oral cephalosporins are advised for second or third line therapy for pregnant women and children aged 3 months or more. Choice of second line antibiotic therapy in adult men should be guided by culture results after considering alternative diagnoses to UTIs. Antibiotic use, even in short courses, can alter the normal microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina, selecting for drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five studies of UTIs managed in primary care found an increased risk of antibiotic resistance that persisted for up to one year and a higher risk associated with multiple courses of antibiotics. Evidence of a dose–response between the number of courses of amoxicillin and trimethoprim and resistance also exists. Antibiotic resistance is associated with higher morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. It is therefore important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and to make appropriate choices to treat UTIs.

This study aimed to describe current investigation, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic re-prescription rates (as a likely indicator of treatment failure) across the spectrum of all lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) managed in primary care in England, with reference to current guideline-defined groups of patients.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^114vimtH]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

Recent national prescribing guidance recommends nitrofurantoin as the first line choice for treating UTIs in adults, with trimethoprim an equivalent choice for those with low risk of antimicrobial resistance, meaning that trimethoprim will continue to be commonly prescribed. Current British National Formulary prescribing guidelines for trimethoprim mention an unquantified risk of hyperkalaemia (but not acute kidney injury), and a possible increase in risk if given with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, and spironolactone. Given the different rates of outcomes within subgroups of the population, it is useful to consider absolute and relative risk together by calculating the excess number of events attributable to trimethoprim treatment, although our very strict definition of a UTI means that these estimates should be treated with caution. As an example, our results suggest that for 1000 UTI episodes treated with antibiotics in those aged 65 and over not taking renin-angiotensin system blockers, treatment with trimethoprim, instead of amoxicillin, would result in one additional case of hyperkalaemia and two of acute kidney injury. Among those taking either renin-angiotensin system blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics the figures would be very similar; two additional cases of both hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. However, treatment with both renin-angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics would result in 18 additional cases of hyperkalaemia and 11 of acute kidney injury.

A small increased absolute risk of a rare outcome (such as in the general population) from trimethoprim may be acceptable when set against a need for multiple treatment options for patients with allergy to other antibiotics or bacterial resistance patterns. While acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia may result in avoidable morbidity and hospital admission, it is reassuring that we have not identified an increased risk of death, suggesting that there is appropriate response to these outcomes. Our results show that trimethoprim continues to be prescribed to people at high risk of adverse outcomes including patients with advanced renal impairment and those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers with potassium-sparing diuretics. For groups at high risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, other antibiotics should be considered, but, if this is not possible, monitoring of renal function and potassium levels should be performed, in line with the existing summary of product characteristics for trimethoprim.

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^112N6hvV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on 2 important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable (Escherichia coli accounts for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for 5% to 15% of isolates), and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs, but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%. Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. As a result, these trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is < 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^111hCFiZ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We calculated odds ratios for each outcome (acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death) within 14 days of antibiotic initiation for a UTI comparing each antibiotic drug (trimethoprim, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin) to amoxicillin (as the reference category) adjusting for potential confounders using logistic regression. We used robust standard errors to account for clustering by general practice. Separately, we repeated the analyses using robust standard errors to account for clustering by patient to account for some patients contributing multiple UTI episodes to the analysis. We initially adjusted for sex and age only, and then fitted an adjusted model using sex, age, calendar period, chronic comorbidities, baseline renal function, history of renal or urological disease, and use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics.

### Increased amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance in Escherichia coli blood isolates, Spain [^113G8tdk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

In addition to being an essential component of the gut flora, Escherichia coli is an etiologic agent for both hospital- and community-acquired infections in humans. As with other bacterial pathogens, this bacterium can develop resistance and multidrug resistance to several antimicrobial families; consequently, antimicrobial treatment of invasive E. coli infections can be challenging.

Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (AMC) is one of the most consumed antimicrobial agents in many countries, principally for respiratory and urinary tract infections. However, little is known about its impact on antimicrobial drug resistance, particularly in E. coli. E. coli is one of the indicator organisms of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS), an international network of surveillance systems that attempt to collect reliable and comparable antimicrobial resistance data on invasive pathogens.

Table 3 — Antibiotic regimens for acute cystitis treatment in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — details first- and second-line options with dosing and precautions. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%", and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d", and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment". Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.

Adverse events for common urinary tract infection (UTI) antibiotics — Nitrofurantoin has reported adverse event rates of 5%–34% and should be avoided if CrCl < 30 mL/min, with pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity risk with long-term use. TMP-SMX has adverse event rates of 1.4%–38%, with hyperkalemia and AKI more likely with TMP-SMX use in patients taking ACE inhibitors and potassium supplements, and hemolysis can occur with G6PD deficiency. Fosfomycin has adverse event rates of 5.3%–8%, with half-life of single dose 30–40 h and serious adverse events rare. Ciprofloxacin has adverse event rates of 4%–28%, and risk of use outweighs benefit if an alternative is available; tendinopathy risk is increased if age > 60 y, with corticosteroid use, or prior heart, kidney, and lung transplant. β-Lactams have adverse event rates of 10%–27% and, compared with other UTI antimicrobials, typically have inferior efficacy and more adverse effects and are associated with higher risk of collateral damage including ESBL selection, multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

### Interaction between antibiotic resistance, resistance genes, and treatment response for urinary tract infections in primary care [^1174qgJP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic treatment, resistance, and early symptom resolution.

Of 278 participants withisolates, 265 (95%) were given empirical antibiotics during the initial consultation, most commonly amoxicillin-clavulanate (63%), ciprofloxacin (26%), and co-trimoxazole (6%). A total of 83% of antibiotics prescribed were active against the isolates for that patient as follows: 88% for nitrofurantoin and 87% for amoxicillin-clavulanate but only 76% for ciprofloxacin and 69% for co-trimoxazole (P value across treatment groups = 0.047).

Among patients with follow-up data (Fig. 2), 152/240 (63%) treated with any empirical antibiotics at initial consultation reported early symptom resolution, which was significantly higher than 3/11 (27%) patients not given empirical antibiotics (P = 0.024). Within the treated group, 135/202 (67%) patients with susceptible isolates reported early resolution versus 17/38 (45%) with nonsusceptible isolates (P = 0.001). Corresponding proportions for those prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanate were 94/134 (70%) versus 8/18 (44%) (P = 0.036); for co-trimoxazole, proportions were 9/10 (90%) versus 0/5 (0%) (P = 0.002); and for nitrofurantoin, proportions were 7/8 (88%) versus 1/1 (100%) (P = 1.000). For ciprofloxacin, however, only 23/48 (48%) treated patients with susceptible isolates reported early resolution versus 7/13 (54%) treated patients with nonsusceptible isolates (P = 0.762).

### High rates of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in Gram-negative urinary tract infection in children with risk factors occurring in the preceding month: considerations for choosing empiric treatment [^111fA58S]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Choosing an empiric treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs) requires epidemiologic data on antibiotic nonsusceptibility (ANS) rates, and risk factors for UTI and ANS in the individual patient. We assessed ANS in community-acquired UTI, and its association with risk factors exposure (previous antibiotic treatment, UTI and hospital visit) < 1 month or 1–11 months before the current UTI episode.

Methods

This was a retrospective, cohort study. Children < 2 years with hospital visits and a positive urine culture obtained < 48 hours from hospital admission whose culture yielded Gram-negative bacteria during the years 2015–2016, were included.

Results

Of the overall 744 episodes, 80% were Escherichia coli. Overall ANS rates were 66% for ampicillin; 27%-29% for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporins (indicating extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 14% for nitrofurantoin; 5%-6% for gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam; and < 1% for meropenem and amikacin. Higher ANS rates were associated with Bedouin (vs. Jewish) ethnicity, exposure to risk factors < 1 month, and to a lesser extent during the 1–11 months before the studied UTI episode. In episodes with risk factors < 1 month, ANS rates were 81% for ampicillin; 47%-58% for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 19% for nitrofurantoin; 12%-23% for gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam; and 2% for meropenem and amikacin.

Conclusions

Previous antibiotic treatment, hospital admission and UTI, especially < 1 month before the current episode, and Bedouin ethnicity, were all associated with high rates of ANS. These findings are important and may assist the treating physician in choosing an adequate empiric treatment for UTI.

### Evaluation of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin) for antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis following Bacillus anthracis inhalational exposure in cynomolgus macaques [^116VkW5V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative infections, such as infections of the ear, nose, and throat, genitourinary tract, skin, and lower respiratory tract; gonorrhea; and Helicobacter pylori. The prophylactic benefit of both amoxicillin and Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate for use against β-lactamase-expressing bacteria) was evaluated for inhalation anthrax in cynomolgus macaques in 2 studies. A pilot study on amoxicillin-clavulanate that used a portion of the study animals demonstrated empirically that dosing twice a day was efficacious. In a subsequent study on both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate that used the remaining study animals, the animals were treated orally every 12 hours on days 1–28 postchallenge and followed for an additional 60 days (total of 88 days from day of aerosol challenge to when the animals were culled). The animals from each treatment arm of the 2 studies were completely protected. All untreated animals succumbed to the infection. The degree of protection observed in this study suggests that both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, administered prophylactically over a period of 28 days after a lethal exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores, is sufficient for full protection.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114R1aPb]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

We extracted and reported resistance to antibiotics commonly prescribed and reported for urinary tract infection in children in primary care: ampicillin, co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (as a marker for cephalosporin resistance). Ampicillin was reported in place of amoxicillin because of more frequent reporting and its equivalence in spectrum of antimicrobial activity.

We used the Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool to assess papers for quality. Selection bias was assessed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for cohort and case-control studies. We produced quality assessment charts based on a traffic light system of "good", "adequate", and "poor" reporting (see appendix 2), as recommended by Cochrane. Our key quality criteria for eligible studies were a reliable measure of antibiotic resistance; clear reporting of bacterial resistance in children and young people aged up to 17; and clear reporting of urinary bacteria isolated as community acquired. The same key quality indicators applied for papers that included information on previous antibiotic exposure, with the addition of adjustment for confounders including age, sex, previous admission to hospital, and comorbidities.

3 Results

3.1 UTI Diagnosis and Patient Characteristics

During the study period, a total of 494,675 episodes were recorded as lower UTI in 300,354 patients registered in 390 general practices (mean 1.7 infections per person). Eighty-three per cent of episodes were in women (Table 1). Median age at diagnosis was 54 years (IQR 31–73). The highest frequency of UTIs occurred in women aged 18–64 years (46.5%) and the lowest amongst children of < 3 months of age (9.1%). The overall mean annual number of UTI episodes per person was 1 (SD = 0.40). The percentage of adults with only 1 UTI episode per year ranged from 79.2% in women aged ≥ 65 years to 91.0% in men aged 18–64 years (Fig. 1). The percentage of adults with ≥ 3 episodes per year (recurrent UTI) ranged from 1.0% in men aged 18–64 years to 2.6% in women aged ≥ 65 years.

Fig. 1
Distribution of patients by the annual number of lower urinary tract infection episodes in adult women and men, Jan 2011–Dec 2015.

An antibiotic prescription for any indication in the previous year was recorded for 66.7% of patients with UTIs. The median time since last prescribed antibiotic was 3.9 months (IQR 1.3–10.4), ranging from 0.6 for children of < 3 months to 6.2 months for those aged 4–15 years. A penicillin (6% co-amoxiclav, 0.5% pivmecillinam, and 29.4% other penicillin), trimethoprim (26.2%) and nitrofurantoin (15.1%) were those most often prescribed. The most common comorbidities present at the time of UTI diagnosis were asthma (15.7%) and cardiovascular diseases (13.5%). Chronic kidney disease was also common in the eldest age group (26.1% of episodes with stage 3 renal disease). A urine sample for microscopy or culture was requested within 10 days for 25.0% of episodes (range between 9.1% in children of < 3 months and 30.6% in 18- to 64-year-old men; Table 2).

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### Urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115fyFbG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

Table 1
Characteristics of the study population at time of antibiotic initiation for urinary tract infection for the whole study population and stratified by antibiotic drug. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

UTI = urinary tract infection; IQR = interquartile range; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; RAS = renin-angiotensin system; KSD = potassium-sparing diuretic.
*Individuals can contribute data from more than one urinary tract infection treated with antibiotics and can therefore be exposed to more than one class of antibiotic or have more than one urinary tract infection treated with the same antibiotic. Therefore, numbers exposed to each class of antibiotic do not total the whole cohort, as individuals may be included in more than one column

Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients at the time of antibiotic prescription for a UTI for the overall study population, and stratified by class of antibiotic prescribed. Amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin were more commonly used to treat UTIs in men and a slightly higher percentage of those prescribed amoxicillin were aged 85 and over. While the proportion of chronic comorbidities were broadly similar across the antibiotics, the patients prescribed trimethoprim had fewer comorbidities compared with amoxicillin. Individuals prescribed nitrofurantoin had better renal function (56% of UTIs treated with nitrofurantoin were in individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m², compared with 37% to 43% for other antibiotics). Ciprofloxacin was more likely to be prescribed for UTIs in patients with a history of prostatic hypertrophy or renal calculi (10% of patients prescribed ciprofloxacin had a history of prostatic hypertrophy compared with 5% to 6% for the other antibiotics, while 4% prescribed ciprofloxacin had a history of renal calculi compared with 2% to 3% for the other antibiotics).

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^115d1h84]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114Tjjso]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^1123SzAu]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Exposures

The date of inclusion was the day of initiation for any of five antibiotic drugs (trimethoprim, amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin) recorded up to three days after a primary care morbidity code for uncomplicated UTI (ie, excluding more severe conditions such as pyelonephritis). We allowed a gap of three days between UTI diagnosis and treatment with an antibiotic to allow for delays between microbiological diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliable measures of antibiotic exposure, we excluded any UTI episodes treated with antibiotics where two or more of the study antibiotics were prescribed on the same day. We excluded prescriptions for co-trimoxazole and did not include patients treated with co-amoxiclav in the amoxicillin comparison group as in the UK these drugs are prescribed for more severe or atypical UTIs. We also excluded any UTI episodes where a patient received one or more of the five study antibiotics in the 14 days before the UTI record to ensure that we were identifying the first consultation for an episode of UTI. Finally, we excluded any UTI episodes where a code for a non-UTI infection was recorded in the three days before antibiotic prescription.

Outcomes

We investigated the outcomes acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death recorded within 14 days of antibiotic initiation for UTI. Acute kidney injury was defined as hospital admission with acute kidney injury using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes recorded in any diagnostic position of any inpatient episode starting within 14 days of antibiotic initiation. Hyperkalaemia was identified in the 14 days after antibiotic initiation using morbidity coding in primary (Read codes) or secondary (ICD-10 codes) care, or a potassium level of 6 mmol/L or more recorded in primary care. Death was identified as the earliest record of death from Read codes in CPRD, CPRD defined death date, ICD-10 codes in HES, and the Office for National Statistics date of death.

All morbidity code lists are available to download, and were either developed for use in other studies, or were developed in a consensus procedure by two authors with clinical experience in the NHS.

### High rates of quinolone resistance among urinary tract infections in the ED [^112sRtE6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are to examine antibiotic resistance rates and to determine appropriate empiric oral antibiotic for patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) evaluated and discharged from the ED.

Methods

A retrospective, single-institution chart review study from August 2008 to March 2009 was conducted. Adult patients seen in the ED with UTI were identified for study inclusion from review of microbiology records. Hospitalized or asymptomatic bacteriuria cases were excluded. Health care-associated (HA)-UTI was defined as UTI with indwelling urinary catheters, health care exposure, or urologic procedures within 3 months. Prevalence of causative bacteria, antibiotic resistance rates, and risk factors for quinolone resistance were determined.

Results

There were 337 eligible patients with 83% women. The most common uropathogens among 357 bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli (71%) and Klebsiella spp. (9%). Overall levofloxacin resistance rate was 17%. Resistance rates for HA-UTIs were significantly greater than those for community-associated-UTI: levofloxacin, 38% vs 10%; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 26% vs 17%; amoxicillin, 53% vs 45%; and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 16% vs 6%. Nitrofurantoin resistance rates were similar (9%). Independent risk factors for levofloxacin resistance were long-term medical conditions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.23; p = 0.001), HA-UTI (aOR, 2.56; p = 0.006), and prior quinolone use within 1 week (aOR, 14.90; p = 0.02) and within 1 to 4 weeks (aOR, 4.62; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

We report high rates of quinolone resistance in ED patients with UTIs at our institution. For patients with risk factors for quinolone resistance, empiric therapy with cephalosporins or nitrofurantoin may be preferred. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be performed to guide definitive therapy for HA-UTIs.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in the outpatient setting: a review [^117VnG78]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Urinary tract infection is among the most common reasons for an outpatient visit and antibiotic use in adult populations. The increasing prevalence of antibacterial resistance among community uropathogens affects the diagnosis and management of this clinical syndrome.

Objectives

To define the optimal approach for treating acute cystitis in young healthy women and in women with diabetes and men and to define the optimal approach for diagnosing acute cystitis in the outpatient setting.

Evidence Review

Evidence for optimal treatment regimens was obtained by searching PubMed and the Cochrane database for English-language studies published up to July 21, 2014.

Findings

Twenty-seven randomized clinical trials (6463 patients), 6 systematic reviews, and 11 observational studies (252,934 patients) were included in our review. Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women can be diagnosed without an office visit or urine culture. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days), nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals (100 mg twice daily for 5–7 days), and fosfomycin trometamol (3 g in a single dose) are all appropriate first-line therapies for uncomplicated cystitis. Fluoroquinolones are effective for clinical outcomes but should be reserved for more invasive infections. β-Lactam agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefpodoxime-proxetil) are not as effective as empirical first-line therapies. Immediate antimicrobial therapy is recommended rather than delayed treatment or symptom management with ibuprofen alone. Limited observational studies support 7 to 14 days of therapy for acute urinary tract infection in men. Based on 1 observational study and our expert opinion, women with diabetes without voiding abnormalities presenting with acute cystitis should be treated similarly to women without diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Immediate antimicrobial therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin is indicated for acute cystitis in adult women. Increasing resistance rates among uropathogens have complicated treatment of acute cystitis. Individualized assessment of risk factors for resistance and regimen tolerability is needed to choose the optimum empirical regimen.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Sulopenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis: a phase 3, randomized trial [^11378jEM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Objectives

The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of IV sulopenem followed by oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid to IV ertapenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin–clavulanate in adults with cUTIs. The primary end point was overall success, defined as clinical cure and microbiologic eradication, in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (day 21). Secondary objectives were to compare the per–patient microbiologic response rates, compare efficacy outcomes at relevant time points, and assess the safety profile of each regimen.

Study Design and Participants

This was a multicenter, randomized, comparative, double-blind phase 3 trial conducted at 131 sites in 13 countries. All patients, or their legal representatives, provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the sites' independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed blinded, pooled overall response data from an interim analysis.

The Supplementary Materials list full inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years with a urine specimen positive for both nitrite and pyuria and signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis or cUTI. Qualifying signs and symptoms included rigors, chills, or fever/hypothermia; flank or pelvic pain; nausea or vomiting; dysuria, urinary urgency, or frequency; and costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Complicating factors that qualified a patient for enrollment included indwelling catheters, neurogenic bladder, obstructive uropathy due to nephrolithiasis, tumor or fibrosis, and surgically modified or abnormal urinary tract anatomy. Patients could be enrolled before cultures were available.

Key exclusion criteria included the presence of chronic indwelling catheters, infections likely due to complete obstruction, emphysematous pyelonephritis, known or expected renal or perinephric abscess, or otherwise expected to require surgical intervention to achieve cure; ileal loops or vesicoureteral reflux; or a history of renal transplantation.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — prior urine culture results: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding antibiotics to which the patient has had a resistant pathogen isolated from the urine previously (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks indicate that more recent urine cultures may be a better guide than more distant cultures and that the time frame for paired cultures varied, but the median was 3–6 months.

### Most antibiotics similar in efficacy for lower UTI… [^117DD7VD]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. Bottom Line This network meta-analysis found that the antibiotics commonly used to treat lower UTI are similar in efficacy, with one exception: amoxicillin/clavulanate is significantly less effective than the others. Synopsis A network meta-analysis is a technique that allows a researcher to compare two treatments via a common comparison group. For example, if one study compared drug A with drug B, and a second study compared drug B with drug C, a network meta-analysis allows us to indirectly compare drug A with drug C. This study compared antibiotics for the treatment of lower UTI. After a careful search, a total of 10 studies comparing eight antibiotics were identified. The authors looked at microbiologic and clinical outcomes; the most important were short-term and long-term clinical cures and adverse effects.

The authors included studies of symptomatic women with available culture results, and they combined different durations of therapy for a given antibiotic into a single arm of the network meta-analysis. The short-term and long-term clinical cure rates were not significantly different among trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and gatifloxacin; amoxicillin/clavulanate, however, was less effective. Ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin were somewhat more effective in the short term. Harms were similar among the drugs.

### Managing uncomplicated urinary tract infections… [^114FafnN]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolones provide good coverage for common uropathogens and cause minimal side effects. Fluoroquinolones should not be taken with products that contain cations, because absorption of the fluoroquinolones will be decreased. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should also avoid these antibiotics. Beta-lactam antibiotics are no longer useful as first-line treatment for UTIs because of increased resistance and higher recurrence rates compared with other agents; however, they may be useful if urine culture indicates susceptibility. Third-generation cephalosporins have lower resistance rates and longer half-lives, allowing for less frequent dosing. The most common side effects of the beta-lactams include rash, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache. Nitrofurantoin can be used in patients with normal renal function. Side effects are rare but may include malaise, cough, and dyspnea.

Pulmonary fibrosis may rarely occur with long-term use. Fosfomycin is used as a single-dose treatment that is generally well tolerated but may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or esophageal discomfort. Antibiotics and dosing information for the treatment of UTIs are listed in. Although single-dose therapy using betalactams, TMP-SMX, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones has a high cure rate, single-dose therapy is associated with a high rate of recurrence within six weeks of initial treatment. Reinfection may come from organisms remaining in the perianal area. Multiple-day regimens are considered more effective, although single-dose regimens are easier to use and generally better tolerated. Short-course therapy using three days of antibiotics appears to provide similar eradication rates with fewer side effects than a seven- to 10-day course.

Patients who may benefit from the longer course of therapy include women who are pregnant, who have diabetes mellitus, or who have a history of urinary tract symptoms. Patients with recurrent UTIs can be offered continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis, patient-initiated treatment, or postcoital prophylaxis taken within two hours of sexual intercourse, if infection is associated with sexual activity. Urine culture is appropriate before prophylactic therapy is started to establish the susceptibility of the pathogen. Patient-initiated therapy using a short course of antibiotics may be successful in younger women.
