## Question

Bactrim

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and formulation. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action. Next, I will review labeled indications and key off-label uses. After that, I need to check dosing by indication, including special populations and renal adjustments. I will then examine contraindications, warnings, and major adverse effects. I should confirm drug interactions and lab interferences. Finally, I will consider resistance concerns, special populations, and practical pearls, and close with a concise clinical summary.

> Let me first confirm the identity and formulation so I don't gloss over basics. Bactrim is the fixed-dose combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in a 5:1 ratio, available as double-strength tablets (800 mg sulfamethoxazole/160 mg trimethoprim) and single-strength tablets (400 mg/80 mg), with oral suspension as an alternative branded product, and both components are synthetic antibacterials with distinct but synergistic pharmacology [^115eZAHV] [^116bCmAb] [^113C9d8M].

> I need to verify the mechanism next. Trimethoprim inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, while sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, producing sequential blockade of folate synthesis; synergy arises because the combination is bactericidal at concentrations where each agent alone would be bacteriostatic, which underpins its clinical utility across several indications [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications without checking the label. Labeled uses include urinary tract infections, acute otitis media in children, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, shigellosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia treatment and prophylaxis, and traveler's diarrhea; these are the FDA-cleared indications and should anchor empiric choices when susceptibility supports use [^111PQgfk] [^112psvoK].

> Next, I should review key off-label but evidence-supported uses, and I need to be careful to separate strong from weaker data. TMP-SMX is commonly used for MRSA skin and soft tissue infections and has randomized data supporting its role in drained abscesses, though it is not noninferior to vancomycin for invasive MRSA and should not be used for severe MRSA bacteremia; it is also used for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Nocardia, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, melioidosis oral therapy, and certain resistant Enterobacterales UTIs, with guideline or trial support varying by condition [^117E864F] [^116cvZxm] [^116XJbFe] [^113zFuj9] [^116LQRvD] [^113w4N9r] [^113p3nbW].

> I will now examine dosing by indication, and I should double-check the high-dose regimens. For PCP treatment, the standard is 15–20 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component divided every 6–8 hours for 21 days; for PCP prophylaxis, 1 DS tablet daily or three times weekly is standard in adults; for uncomplicated female cystitis, 1 DS tablet twice daily for 3 days is typical; for other UTIs, 1 DS tablet twice daily for 10–14 days is customary; for shigellosis or traveler's diarrhea, 1 DS tablet twice daily for 5 days is usual; for acute otitis media in children, weight-based dosing of 8 mg/kg trimethoprim and 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per day in two divided doses for 10 days is recommended; for MRSA SSTI, 1–2 DS tablets twice daily for 7–14 days is common practice, acknowledging variability in evidence and severity [^112psvoK] [^115HAqZm] [^113Gsi3r] [^111PEwNW] [^115YPFJf].

> Wait, let me verify renal dosing because accumulation and hyperkalemia are clinically important. For CrCl 15–30 mL/min, reduce the dose by 50% and monitor renal function and potassium; for CrCl < 15 mL/min, avoid use if renal status cannot be monitored, and if used in dialysis, treat as CrCl < 15 mL/min with substantial dose reduction; for CRRT, dose adjustments are complex and depend on modality and flow, so PK-guided adjustments and, when available, therapeutic drug monitoring are prudent; recent population PK work suggests about 16.7% dose reduction at eGFR 30 and 33.3% at eGFR 10 for PCP-level exposures, reinforcing the need to individualize and consider TDM in high-dose indications [^115uyNcC] [^111sHFGH] [^111AWTKc] [^116jvTrL] [^113uVBLs] [^112xFTRF].

> I should confirm pediatric nuances and contraindications in neonates. TMP-SMX is contraindicated in infants under 2 months because of the risk of kernicterus from sulfonamide-related bilirubin displacement; in older children, dosing is weight-based with attention to the TMP component and daily maxima, and HIV-specific pediatric guidelines provide detailed prophylaxis and treatment schedules for PCP and toxoplasmosis that should be followed when applicable [^1147ZMQd] [^112psvoK] [^114hm7Zp] [^114DXVco].

> Let me consider pregnancy carefully, and I need to reconcile evolving data with traditional cautions. Historically, first-trimester exposure has been linked with neural tube and other congenital anomalies, so use is generally avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh risks; however, a recent randomized trial of TMP-SMX prophylaxis in pregnant women did not show improved birth outcomes and underscores that routine prophylaxis is not beneficial for fetal growth, while guidelines still allow TMP-SMX for PCP treatment and prophylaxis in the second/third trimester with ultrasound surveillance after first-trimester exposure; folate supplementation is reasonable when exposure occurs in early gestation [^115vtG5N] [^113wZ69x] [^114xHGLK] [^115FFo1u].

> Next, I should review contraindications and key warnings so I don't miss life-threatening risks. Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim, history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia with these agents, megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency, marked hepatic damage, severe renal insufficiency when monitoring is not feasible, and coadministration with dofetilide; major warnings include severe cutaneous adverse reactions, fulminant hepatic necrosis, blood dyscrasias, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, and respiratory failure from hypersensitivity pneumonitis; patients with AIDS have higher rates of rash, fever, leukopenia, and transaminitis, warranting closer monitoring [^1147ZMQd] [^113RRnHU] [^116cnh5b] [^117GWeVt].

> I will now examine adverse effects and monitoring, and I should double-check the electrolyte risks. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset and rash; serious risks include SCARs, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, crystalluria, C. difficile colitis, hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, and rare hypoglycemia; for high-dose therapy, obtain frequent CBCs, renal function, and electrolytes, ensure adequate hydration to mitigate crystalluria, and monitor potassium closely in patients with renal impairment or on RAAS blockers, as population data link TMP-SMX with hyperkalemia and sudden death in high-risk groups [^116ZgPCy] [^113RRnHU] [^113dEY7u] [^114pht5t].

> But wait, what about drug interactions and lab interferences; I need to check those before finalizing orders. TMP-SMX interacts via CYP2C8/2C9 inhibition and OCT2 transport effects, so avoid coadministration with dofetilide, and use caution with warfarin, phenytoin, procainamide, and other narrow therapeutic index drugs; trimethoprim can falsely elevate creatinine in Jaffé-based assays by about 10% and interfere with certain methotrexate immunoassays, so interpret labs in context; concomitant methotrexate increases toxicity and is generally avoided, and TMP-SMX can potentiate hyperkalemia with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and potassium-sparing diuretics [^1148veyB] [^114ncBJf] [^112njPSB] [^113dEY7u].

> I should confirm resistance patterns and stewardship implications. TMP-SMX resistance is substantial in some pathogens and regions, particularly Enterobacterales and Staphylococcus aureus, so therapy should be guided by cultures when possible; interestingly, systematic reviews suggest TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV may not increase and may even be associated with reduced resistance to other antibiotic classes, though more definitive studies are needed, and stewardship principles remain essential to preserve activity [^115nBctr] [^114thHFN] [^116bLCRt] [^1114hcWz].

> Let me reconsider special populations and practical pearls so I don't overlook bedside issues. In hepatic impairment, avoid TMP-SMX when possible due to risks of fulminant hepatic necrosis; in the elderly, monitor closely for hematologic toxicity, electrolyte disturbances, and renal function; for PCP, consider therapeutic drug monitoring when available, especially with renal dysfunction, to balance efficacy targets with toxicity thresholds; for patients with prior TMP-SMX intolerance, dose escalation rechallenge strategies can improve tolerability for prophylaxis; and always counsel on hydration, early signs of hypersensitivity, and the need to complete the course to reduce resistance [^114qd7KR] [^114C6Hbr] [^113uVBLs] [^112rbpWH] [^1148veyB].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are precise. TMP-SMX is a synergistic folate-pathway inhibitor with a broad but selective role spanning common infections and key opportunistic pathogens; dosing must be indication-specific and renal-adjusted, with heightened vigilance for hyperkalemia, hematologic toxicity, and SCARs; contraindications and interactions are non-negotiable in several scenarios; and while resistance is a concern, judicious, culture-informed use maintains its value across UTIs, MRSA SSTI, PCP, Stenotrophomonas, Nocardia, toxoplasmosis, and selected resistant Gram-negative infections, with pregnancy remaining a setting where risk–benefit must be individualized and monitored closely [^111PQgfk] [^112psvoK] [^113RRnHU] [^1147ZMQd] [^114xHGLK].

---

Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) is a **fixed-dose combination antibiotic** used for UTIs, MRSA skin infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and certain diarrheal illnesses [^111PQgfk]. It is **first-line for PCP** [^112E5Q19] and a key alternative for MRSA when beta-lactams are unsuitable [^notfound]. Dosing is standard for most infections, but **reduce by 50% if CrCl is 15–30 mL/min** [^115uyNcC] and avoid if CrCl < 15 mL/min [^111sHFGH]. Major risks include **hyperkalemia** [^113dEY7u], **severe cutaneous reactions** [^116cnh5b], and **hematologic toxicity** [^113RRnHU]; monitor potassium and CBC in high-risk patients. It is contraindicated in infants < 2 months, patients with sulfonamide allergy, or severe hepatic/renal impairment [^1147ZMQd].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Sequential inhibition of folate synthesis; trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, yielding synergistic bactericidal activity [^notfound].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid oral absorption; protein binding ~70% for sulfamethoxazole and ~44% for trimethoprim; hepatic metabolism and renal excretion [^113rYBoh].

---

## Clinical indications

Bactrim is indicated for multiple infections, including:

| **Indication** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|
| Urinary tract infections (UTIs) | Uncomplicated and complicated UTIs caused by susceptible organisms [^111PQgfk] [^111n8KHU] |
| Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections | Skin and soft tissue infections, including abscesses [^117E864F] [^113Gsi3r] |

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim**, **severe hepatic impairment**, **severe renal insufficiency when renal function cannot be monitored**, **megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency**, and **infants < 2 months** [^1147ZMQd]. Precautions include use in patients with **renal or hepatic impairment**, **folate deficiency**, **G6PD deficiency**, or **concurrent medications that increase potassium** [^113RRnHU].

---

## Drug interactions

- **Warfarin**: Increased anticoagulant effect and bleeding risk.

- **Methotrexate**: Increased methotrexate toxicity due to inhibition of renal tubular secretion.

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Increased risk of hyperkalemia.

- **Digoxin**: Potential for increased digoxin levels and toxicity.

---

## Resistance considerations

Resistance is a growing concern, particularly among **Enterobacterales** and **Staphylococcus aureus** [^notfound]; susceptibility testing is recommended to guide therapy [^111PQgfk].

---

## Special populations

In pregnancy, **use only if benefits outweigh risks** because of potential fetal harm; consider folic acid supplementation [^115FFo1u] [^115vtG5N]. In pediatrics, **use is contraindicated in infants < 2 months**; weight-based dosing is used in older children [^1147ZMQd] [^112psvoK]. In geriatrics, **use with caution** due to increased risk of adverse effects, including hematologic and renal toxicity [^111L857S] [^114pht5t].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend Bactrim as **first-line therapy for PCP** [^1129NodS] and as an **alternative agent for MRSA infections**, particularly in patients with beta-lactam allergies or intolerance [^notfound].

---

Bactrim is a **combination antibiotic** with broad activity, notably for UTIs, MRSA skin infections, and PCP. It requires **careful dosing in renal impairment** and vigilant monitoring for serious adverse effects, including hyperkalemia and severe cutaneous reactions.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age. BACTRIM is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that BACTRIM could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia

For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jirovecii pneumonia.

Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults

For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^113rYBoh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

BACTRIM is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in humans to at least 5 metabolites: the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy- sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The formulation of N4-hydroxy metabolite is mediated via CYP2C9.

Trimethoprim is metabolized in vitro to 11 different metabolites, of which, five are glutathione adducts and six are oxidative metabolites, including the major metabolites, 1- and 3-oxides and the 3- and 4-hydroxy derivatives.

The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the therapeutically active forms.

In vitro studies suggest that trimethoprim is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OCT1 and OCT2, and that sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein.

Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking BACTRIM immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Blood dyscrasias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Crystalluria**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- **Hemolysis**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- **Hepatic necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- **Increased risk of adverse events**: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- **Lung injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Blood dyscrasias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Crystalluria**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- **Hemolysis**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- **Hepatic necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- **Increased risk of adverse events**: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- **Infusion-related reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim infusion can cause local irritation and inflammation in cases of extravasation.
- **Lung injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- **Metabolic acidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains propylene glycol as a solvent, which at high doses can cause metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.
- **Sulfite sensitivity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions in susceptible patients.

Electrolyte Abnormalities

Hyperkalemia: High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

Hyponatremia: Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving BACTRIM, particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

Crystalluria: During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- **Porphyria**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- **Possible folate deficiency**: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in the non-HIV-infected population [^1129BKNc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Summarize data on the pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention options for non-AIDS immunocompromised patients who have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); review the epidemiology of patients presenting with PJP; and discuss the first and second-line pharmacological options for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in this population.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1989-February 2016) searched. Terms searched included combinations of Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pneumocystis carinii, non-HIV, infected, patients, prevention, prophylaxis, Bactrim, treatment, AIDS, opportunistic, immunocompromised, cancer, and pathophysiology

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles included had the most relevant information on PJP pathophysiology, and first-/second-line treatment and prophylactic options. Inclusion criteria were met and evaluated with 43 sources.

Data Synthesis

P jirovecii has a complicated life-cycle; it seeks to find compromised immune systems in order to replicate, causing life-threatening complications. With immunosuppressive medications coming to market for immunomodulating diseases, PJP has become a prevalent opportunistic infection in the non-HIV population. CD4+ lymphocyte count < 200 cells/µL is the primary risk factor for PJP presentation in these patients. With data from clinical trials, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has become the primary treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in the non-HIV population, although second-line options are available.

Conclusion

PJP is a health problem that may result in an increased concern as more immunomodulating medications to treat various disease states are developed. Patients on these drugs or those with immunosuppressive diseases should have their CD4+ count monitored. Health care providers should continue to use TMP/SMX as the primary option in non-HIV, immunocompromised patients for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114thHFN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence with regard to whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis causes an increase in bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. From a public health perspective, an increase in resistance would reduce the usefulness of current first-line antibiotics and result in reduced options for treating common bacterial infections in developing countries. From an individual perspective, patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis may be at increased risk of treatment failure when they acquire a bacterial infection, although this has not been demonstrated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of TMP-SMX.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

BACTRIM, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).

The presence of BACTRIM may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole; equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day).

Mutagenesis

In vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was negative. In in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.

Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay and in in vitro micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes.

Trimethoprim alone was negative in in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assays and in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation. In in vitro Comet, micronucleus and chromosomal damage assays using cultured human lymphocytes, trimethoprim was positive. In mice following oral administration of trimethoprim, no DNA damage in Comet assays of liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or bone marrow was recorded.

Impairment of Fertility

No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given oral dosages as high as 350 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole plus 70 mg/kg/day trimethoprim, doses roughly two times the recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis.

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions

Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions of the Respiratory Tract

Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment.

Respiratory Failure

Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days to week of BACTRIM initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products.

Circulatory Shock

Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM, in patients with history of recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions

BACTRIM should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in patients treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver enzyme and coagulation abnormalities. If HLH is suspected, discontinue BACTRIM immediately and institute appropriate management.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116bLCRt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

After placing weight on good-quality studies and additional weight on studies that were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance, the findings of this review offer suggestive evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV protects against development of bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. More carefully designed studies should be conducted to answer this question. It is important to ensure that future studies evaluate the importance of duration of exposure to TMP-SMX on antimicrobial resistance.

Ideally, microbial resistance surveys should be included with TMP-SMX implementation in developing countries to alert providers to any changes in drug resistance patterns.

Of most importance, the fear of antibiotic resistance should not stop health care providers from giving TMP-SMX to individuals who need it.

### Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^115nBctr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Sulfonamides have a glorious history. In 1935, they were the first class of true antimicrobial agents with life-saving potency. Today, 66 years later, increased bacterial resistance to sulfonamides and to trimethoprim (TMP), a synthetic antimicrobial agent that is 30 years younger than sulfonamides, has limited their use to only a few indications. In the treatment and prophylaxis of patients with urinary tract infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or TMP alone is still considered the first-line drug of choice, although increased bacterial resistance to these agents has been linked with treatment failure. TMP-SMZ has a possible role as a second- or third-line treatment for patients who have respiratory tract infections. In the developing world, where this inexpensive drug is widely used as first-line treatment, bacterial resistance has caused problems, especially with regard to the treatment of patients with severe respiratory tract infections. Use of TMP-SMZ as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection has rapidly increased the multidrug resistance of bacterial pathogens found in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Today, detailed and reliable knowledge on the resistance of bacterial pathogens to both TMP-SMZ and TMP is an essential requirement for the safe and effective use of these drugs in all clinical settings.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116gcvqq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has long been recommended for immunosuppressed HIV-infected adults and children born to HIV-infected women. Despite this, many resource-limited countries have not implemented this recommendation, partly because of fear of widespread antimicrobial resistance not only to TMP-SMX, but also to other antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-infected and/or exposed individuals increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in Medline, Global Health, Embase, Web of Science, ELDIS, and ID21.

Results

A total of 501 studies were identified, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Only 8 studies were of high quality, of which only 2 had been specifically designed to answer this question. Studies were classified as (1) studies in which all participants were infected and/or colonized and in which rates of bacterial resistance were compared between those taking or not taking TMP-SMX and (2) studies comparing those who had a resistant infection with those who were not infected. Type 1 studies showed weak evidence that TMP-SMX protects against resistance. Type 2 studies provided more convincing evidence that TMP-SMX protects against infection.

Conclusion

There was some evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against resistance to other antibiotics. However, more carefully designed studies are needed to answer the question conclusively.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111kKcmx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-February 2003) and EMBASE (1980-February 2003). Key search terms included trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination and Staphylococcus aureus.

Data Synthesis

An evaluation of case reports, case series, and clinical studies focusing on the use of TMP/SMX for treatment of severe S. aureus infections was conducted. The majority of the reports indicate that TMP/SMX may be effective for the treatment of infections due to low bacterial burdens of susceptible strains of S. aureus.

Conclusions

In select infections, TMP/SMX may be a useful alternative to vancomycin for treatment of severe S. aureus infections. Additional randomized studies should be conducted comparing this agent with vancomycin and linezolid.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112xFTRF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

eGFR and CRRT were included as covariates in both models. As expected, it was observed that the inclusion of eGFR had a more significant impact on the clearance of N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole compared with sulfamethoxazole. The primary clearance route for sulfamethoxazole is liver metabolism, with less than 30% being recovered unchanged in urine. In contrast, N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole is mainly cleared renally, leading to its accumulation in patients with reduced eGFR. For trimethoprim, the association between eGFR and clearance was also as expected, since the primary elimination route is renal clearance, with only a small percentage of metabolism or biliary excretion.

The final model was used to generate dose recommendations for PCP and dose reductions in case of renal insufficiency. A starting dose of TID 1,920 mg or b.i.d. 2,400 mg for PCP will result in sufficient exposure in the majority of patients. TID 1,920 mg has a larger risk of concentrations above the target range while b.i.d. 2,400 mg has a larger risk of underexposure. Because of the large IIV, TDM should be considered to improve the percentage of patients within the target range. Patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 require a dose reduction of 16.7%, and patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 a dose reduction of 33.3% to reach similar exposure to patients without renal insufficiency. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases with doses in patients with a low eGFR. Therefore, for infections requiring high‐dose cotrimoxazole like PCP or infections caused by Nocardia spp. the risk of concentration‐dependent toxicity should be compared with the risk of low exposure when selecting an initial dosing regimen.

Methotrexate — contraindications and drug interactions specify that methotrexate is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy or nursing and in patients with cirrhosis or who have significant anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Methotrexate should not be used in combination with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Septra [Hoffmann-La Roche Inc, Roche, Nutley, NJ], Bactrim [Monarch Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bristol, TN]) because of increased methotrexate toxicity. Although the combination is contraindicated in official labeling, methotrexate can be used in combination with acitretin when necessary with appropriate hepatic monitoring.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114C6Hbr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared with other antibiotics, the pharmacodynamics of cotrimoxazole are poorly understood. It is unclear which pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index (fT > MIC, C max > MIC, or AUC/MIC) best correlates with the efficacy of cotrimoxazole. Target concentrations for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are predominantly based on theoretical assumptions and in vitro measurements rather than an association with clinical outcomes. For the treatment of PCP, target concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been suggested and used in both research and TDM in clinical practice. Specifically, sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations above 5 mg/L are recommended. These targets are originally based on two small studies. The first study included 26 children with PCP and found that 3–5 mg/L for trimethoprim and 100–150 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole resulted in clinical effectiveness. The other study included eight adults with PCP and reported that trimethoprim concentrations below 5.5 mg/L were linked to treatment failure. The concentrations associated with toxicity have been studied more extensively: concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity both in healthy individuals as in patients with PCP. concentration‐dependent adverse events that have been described include hematological toxicity, hyperkalemia, renal failure and central nervous system adverse effects.,

Studies assessing the optimal initial dosing regimen to reach the target concentrations for PCP are lacking. Moreover, limited information is available regarding the need for dose reductions in patients with reduced renal function or on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Several dosing regimens have been proposed for patients with altered renal function, but these recommendations lack support from population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) simulations that consider both effectiveness and toxicity.,

To address these gaps, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole. Based on the measured serum concentrations, a model for trimethoprim and a combined population pharmacokinetic model for sulfamethoxazole and its metabolite N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole were developed. These models enabled us to simulate dose regimens and dose adjustments for patients with altered renal function or those receiving CRRT for PCP.

### A trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in pregnancy to improve birth outcomes [^113wZ69x]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Maternal infections underlie several adverse birth outcomes. Whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during pregnancy will improve birth outcomes is unknown.

Methods

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Zimbabwe, we assigned pregnant women to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, at a dose of 960 mg daily, or placebo from at least 14 weeks' gestation until delivery. The primary outcome was birth weight.

Results

Among 993 participants (131 with human immunodeficiency virus infection), 498 were randomly assigned to receive placebo and 495 to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with the first dose received at a median of 21.7 weeks' gestation (interquartile range, 17.3 to 26.4). In intention-to-treat analyses, the mean (± SD) birth weight was 3040 ± 460 g in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 3019 ± 526 g in the placebo group (mean difference, 20 g, 95% confidence interval, -43 to 83; P = 0.53). The number of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

In Zimbabwe, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during pregnancy did not significantly increase infant birth weight. (Funded by Wellcome and others; Pan African Clinical Trials Registry number, PACTR202107707978619.).

Sample size and analysis

To establish non-inferiority, we allowed a difference of up to 15% in the primary outcome. Assuming a 30% treatment failure rate for both treatment groups, we needed a sample of 128 patients per arm for a one sided test to rule out the pre-specified difference in the 95% confidence interval of the difference between groups, allowing for 10% non-evaluable patients (α = 0.05, β = 0.8). We did interim analyses of the primary safety outcome after recruitment of one third and two thirds of patients, with stopping boundaries (two sided α level, P < 0.01).

We did the primary analysis by intention to treat. We did per protocol analysis for patients without exclusion criteria after randomisation who received allocated treatment for a minimum of seven days. We did subgroup analysis for patients with MRSA bacteraemia. We used χ 2 or Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical outcomes. Continuous outcomes were skewed, so we described them as medians and compared them by using a median difference, all with 95% confidence intervals. We did multivariable analyses for the primary efficacy outcome, including the treatment arm as an independent variable. We entered all variables significantly associated with the outcome on univariate analysis (P < 0.05) and not correlated (Spearman correlation > 0.5) into a logistic regression analysis. We present risk ratios or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

### Low-dose vs Conventional-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia in Patients not infected with HIV: a multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study [^111fPjMB]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is an effective treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised patients with and without HIV infection; however, a high incidence of adverse events has been observed. Low-dose TMP-SMX is a potentially effective treatment with fewer adverse events; however, evidence is limited.

Research Question

What is the efficacy and safety of low-dose TMP-SMX for non-HIV PCP compared with conventional-dose TMP-SMX after adjusting for patient background characteristics?

Study Design and Methods

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we included patients diagnosed with non-HIV PCP and treated with TMP-SMX between June 2006 and March 2021 at three institutions. The patients were classified into low-dose (TMP < 12.5 mg/kg/d) and conventional-dose (TMP 12.5–20 mg/kg/d) groups. The primary end point was 30-day mortality, and the secondary end points were 180-day mortality, adverse events grade 3 or higher per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, and initial treatment completion rates. Background characteristics were adjusted using the overlap weighting method with propensity scores.

Results

Fifty-five patients in the low-dose group and 81 in the conventional-dose group were evaluated. In the overall cohort, the average age was 70.7 years, and the proportion of women was 55.1%. The average dose of TMP-SMX was 8.71 mg/kg/d in the low-dose group and 17.78 mg/kg/d in the conventional-dose group. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (6.7% vs 18.4%, respectively; p = 0.080) or 180-day mortality (14.6% vs 26.1%, respectively; p = 0.141) after adjusting for patient background characteristics. The incidence of adverse events, especially nausea and hyponatremia, was significantly lower in the low-dose group (29.8% vs 59.0%, respectively; p = 0.005). The initial treatment completion rates were 43.3% and 29.6% in the low-dose and conventional-dose groups (P = 0.158), respectively.

Interpretation

Survival was similar between the low-dose and conventional-dose TMP-SMX groups, and low-dose TMP-SMX was associated with reduced adverse events in patients with non-HIV PCP.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115G8pUx]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isosporiasis — primary prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy states there are no U.S. recommendations for primary prophylaxis of isosporiasis. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, 160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively) was effective in preventing isosporiasis in adults with World Health Organization stage 2 or 3 HIV infection in Cote d'Ivoire, and in an observational study the incidence of isosporiasis decreased after widespread availability of ART, except among persons with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3. Although studies in children are lacking, the relationship between severe immunosuppression and disease in adults suggests that initiating ART in children with HIV before they become severely immunodeficient may reduce the incidence of isosporiasis, and the guideline lists discontinuing primary prophylaxis as "Not applicable".

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^114pht5t]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. This may be owing to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternately, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015 over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England and it remains a first line option for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death both in the general population and in high risk groups is unknown.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; p = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus doxycycline as oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis (MERTH): a multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^114muego]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

All patients were analysed on the basis of their original allocation group (intention-to-treat analysis). Continuous variables are presented as median (IQR). IQRs are presented in terms of 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical data are presented as number (%). We did survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Time was measured from the day of study enrolment. For the primary analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) with culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis as the failure outcome, participants were censored on the day of last follow-up or death due to other causes. We tested non-inferiority of the TMP-SMX plus placebo group by calculating the HR for the efficacy of TMP-SMX plus placebo over the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, and compared the upper limit of the 95% CI to the non-inferiority margin. To accept the non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, the upper limit of the 95% CI needed to be equal to or less than 1·7. A one sided-test at an alpha error of 5% was also calculated for the non-inferiority margin. For the secondary analyses with treatment changes and treatment failure as the outcomes, participants were censored on the day of recurrent melioidosis or death due to other causes. We calculated the probabilities of event outcomes at each timepoint using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the Cox Proportional Hazard model, we assessed whether the hazard ratio was constant over time using Schoenfeld residuals. The analysis was repeated for the primary outcome in the per-protocol population, in which those who did not complete 20 weeks of study drug were excluded.

As recurrent melioidosis can be caused by either relapse or re-infection, we also assessed the efficacy of TMP-SMX for culture-confirmed relapse in a sensitivity analysis on the basis that we would not expect antimicrobial treatment to prevent re-infection after treatment has been completed. We did this using culture-confirmed relapse as a failure outcome and excluding patients who had no paired bacterial isolates available for genotyping from the first and recurrent episode and those with paired isolates and genotyping results that confirmed re-infection.

For safety analyses, we assessed the proportion of patients who had adverse drug reactions by treatment group. We compared proportions using the Fisher's exact test and continuous variables using the Mann-Whitney test. We used STATA (version 12.1) for all statistical analyses.

As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advisable in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction.

Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis.6 However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus doxycycline as oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis (MERTH): a multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^113w4N9r]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, is difficult to cure. Antimicrobial treatment comprises intravenous drugs for at least 10 days, followed by oral drugs for at least 12 weeks. The standard oral regimen based on trial evidence is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxaxole (TMP-SMX) plus doxycycline. This regimen is used in Thailand but is associated with side-effects and poor adherence by patients, and TMP-SMX alone is recommended in Australia. We compared the efficacy and side-effects of TMP-SMX with TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment.

Methods

For this multi-centre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients (aged ≥ 15 years) from five centres in northeast Thailand with culture-confirmed melioidosis who had received a course of parenteral antimicrobial drugs. Using a computer-generated sequence, we randomly assigned patients to receive TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for 20 weeks (1:1; block size of ten, stratified by study site). We followed patients up every 4 months for 1 year and annually thereafter to the end of the study. The primary endpoint was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis, and the non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.7. This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN86140460.

Findings

We enrolled and randomly assigned 626 patients: 311 to TMP-SMX plus placebo and 315 to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. 16 patients (5%) in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 21 patients (7%) in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group developed culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.42–1.55). The criterion for non-inferiority was met (p = 0.01). Adverse drug reactions were less common in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group than in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (122 [39%] vs 167 [53%]).

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that TMP-SMX is not inferior to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment, and is preferable on the basis of safety and tolerance by patients.

### Transient psychosis in an immune-competent patient after oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration [^1122XfGz]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

We describe a rare adverse reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; Septra, Bactrim) in an immune-competent female adolescent. She was prescribed TMP-SMX for a urinary tract infection, which she had developed while being treated in the hospital for an extensive leg cellulitis. Shortly after receiving her third dose of TMP-SMX, she developed an acute altered mental status with agitation as well as vivid visual and auditory hallucinations. After prompt discontinuation of TMP-SMX, the patient slowly began to improve and was able to return to her baseline mental status within 10 days. No residual mental status changes were present. Despite the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, TMP-SMX, one of the first-generation broad-spectrum antibiotics, continues to be widely prescribed, in part because of its low cost and its easy availability. It is generally well tolerated and is associated with relatively few adverse effects. More common toxicities associated with TMP-SMX include hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, and gastrointestinal side effects. Central nervous system toxicity is very rare; when reported, it has been in an immune-compromised or an elderly patient.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative pathogens. Sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations > 5 mg/L have been associated with clinical effectiveness for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, its metabolite N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity. All three components are cleared to some extent by renal clearance.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Which dosing regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be used to reach the target concentrations for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and which dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg lead to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

The dosing regimens suggested in this study can enhance the utilization of cotrimoxazole in hospitalized patients. The population pharmacokinetic models developed in this study can also be utilized to optimize treatment with cotrimoxazole for other infectious diseases.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^114rnaSa]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Animal Data

In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area.

Nonteratogenic Effects

See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.

Nursing Mothers: Levels of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in breast milk are approximately 2% to 5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding, jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.

Pediatric Use: Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections).

Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a
proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is
unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the
development of drug-resistant bacteria. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should
be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, to
those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics,
patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome,
and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or
bronchial asthma. In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals,
hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy.
Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving
high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in
elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney
failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism but this is of
no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary
restriction.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo for uncomplicated skin abscess [^117E864F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

Results

The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.

Conclusions

In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00729937.).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) dose escalation versus direct rechallenge for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with previous adverse reaction to TMP-SMZ [^112rbpWH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is the most effective Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylactic agent, but adverse reactions are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and limit its use. This randomized, double-blind controlled trial compared 2 methods of TMP-SMZ reintroduction, 6-day dose escalation and direct rechallenge, for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients who had experienced previous treatment-limiting reactions. The primary end point was the ability to take single-strength TMP-SMZ daily for 6 months. Seventy-five percent of the dose-escalation group and 57% of the direct-rechallenge group continued to receive daily single-strength TMP-SMZ for 6 months (P = 0.014). Among premature discontinuations, 58% of the dose-escalation group and 70% of the direct-rechallenge group were due to adverse reactions. None of these reactions was serious. This study provides evidence that it is possible to successfully reintroduce TMP-SMZ to a significant proportion of HIV-infected patients who have experienced mild-to-moderate treatment-limiting adverse reactions.

### The effect of long-term intermittent trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole treatment on recurrences of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis [^116p67Rk]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the effect of long-term intermittent trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment on recurrences of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.

Design

Prospective randomized open-labeled interventional clinical trial.

Methods

A total of 124 patients with a history of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis were randomized to treatment with one tablet of trimethoprim (160 mg)/sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) (Bactrim F; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) every 3 days (61 patients) or to observation without treatment (63 patients) and were followed monthly for up to 20 consecutive months for clinical signs of disease recurrence. A recurrence was defined as a new focus of necrotizing retinochoroiditis with active inflammation either adjacent to or remote from preexisting retinochoroidal scars.

Results

Recurrences developed in four (6.6%) treated patients and in 15 (23.8%) controls (P = 0.01). Treatment was discontinued prematurely in four patients because of mild drug reactions.

Conclusion

Long-term intermittent treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can reduce the rate of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.

### Topical bactrim versus trimethoprim and sulfonamide against Nocardia keratitis [^114ogLCM]. Cornea (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The conventional treatment of Nocardia keratitis is with topical sulfonamides. Recently, topical trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) has been suggested as treatment. This study compares the in vitro efficacy against Nocardia asteroides of Bactrim and various ratios of trimethoprim and a sulfonamide.

Methods

Antibiotic disks were soaked with various ratios of trimethoprim and sulfacetamide sodium. They contained trimethoprim alone, sulfacetamide sodium alone, and both trimethoprim and sulfacetamide sodium at ratios of 1:40, 1:20, and 1:5. Disks containing Bactrim were also prepared. Each disk was placed on blood agar plates streaked with N. asteroides. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 hours and then examined.

Results

Trimethoprim alone showed minimal effect. Sulfacetamide sodium alone had a clearance zone of 12 mm. The plates of trimethoprim and sulfacetamide sodium at ratios of 1:40, 1:20, and 1:5 had clearance zones of 14 mm, 17 mm, and 27 mm, respectively. Bactrim had a clearance zone of 70 mm.

Conclusion

Trimethoprim or sulfacetamide sodium alone is not as effective as both drugs together. As the ratio of the two drugs was changed, potency differed against Nocardia organisms. Bactrim was the most effective antibiotic against Nocardia organisms. It should be the recommended agent for the treatment of Nocardia keratitis.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^116cvZxm]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority compared with vancomycin among patients with invasive MRSA infections. In the subgroup of patients with bacteraemia, the difference in treatment failure and all cause mortality might be clinically important. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for the treatment of severe MRSA infections. We propose a further randomised controlled trial to examine the feasibility of step-down from vancomycin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, allowing early discharge of patients with MRSA responding to treatment.
