## Question

dose of acarbose for diabetes and renal adjustment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosing of acarbose for diabetes, including how to start and titrate the medication, considerations for special populations, and specifically how to adjust dosing in the setting of renal impairment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard dosing and titration strategy from authoritative labeling. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetics to anticipate why renal function matters. Next, I will review guideline-based renal thresholds and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. After that, I should translate this into a practical dosing recommendation across renal function strata. Finally, I will check monitoring, drug–drug interactions, and patient counseling, and synthesize a concise, actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the standard dosing framework from the FDA label, since that anchors all subsequent adjustments. The recommended starting dose is 25 mg orally three times daily with the first bite of each main meal, with a "start low, go slow" approach to mitigate gastrointestinal effects; maintenance dosing ranges from 50 to 100 mg three times daily, with a maximum of 300 mg per day, and the highest maintenance dose of 100 mg three times daily is reserved for patients weighing more than 60 kg to mitigate transaminase risk [^111HutTs] [^117HtNxC] [^115vMh96].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for renal caution before jumping to thresholds. Although acarbose is minimally absorbed systemically, the small absorbed fraction and active metabolites are cleared by the kidney, and in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m²), exposure increases roughly five- to sixfold, which underpins safety concerns even with predominantly local gastrointestinal effects [^115Y8e9i].

> I should confirm renal impairment thresholds next, and I need to reconcile two lines of guidance that use different metrics. One line of guidance emphasizes creatinine-based cutoffs: the FDA notes no long-term safety data in patients with serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL and does not recommend treatment in such patients, while the Endocrine Society advises avoiding acarbose when serum creatinine is at least 2.0 mg/dL; conversely, another line uses eGFR: KDOQI recommends avoiding acarbose when eGFR is less than 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m², which is directionally concordant with the FDA pharmacokinetic warning in severe renal dysfunction [^112yhrUo] [^111CmHez] [^11258Jmg] [^113duoit] [^116mchsx].

> Hold on, I should verify the most conservative, clinically safe approach across renal function strata and ensure internal consistency. For eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher, standard dosing without adjustment is acceptable; for eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², I initially thought no dose reduction was needed, but wait, I should double-check the label and guideline signals that caution against accumulation in moderate impairment, so using the low end of the maintenance range and close monitoring is prudent even though formal dose reduction is not specified; for eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL or higher, avoid acarbose due to markedly increased exposure and lack of long-term safety data; in dialysis or ESRD, acarbose is not recommended [^112yhrUo] [^111CmHez] [^11258Jmg] [^1138eVQv] [^116mchsx] [^113sfeyx].

> Let me think about special populations and body-weight considerations to avoid overgeneralization. For patients 60 kg or less, the maximum recommended dose is 50 mg three times daily to mitigate hepatotoxicity risk. Elderly patients may have modestly higher exposure but no specific dose reduction beyond the usual renal caution is mandated, so individualize based on renal function and tolerability. For pregnancy and lactation, data are limited and acarbose is generally not preferred, so consider alternatives in line with guideline-based risk–benefit assessment [^111HutTs] [^115Y8e9i].

> Next, I should review titration and monitoring to ensure the plan is operationally sound. Titrate every 4–8 weeks based on 1-hour postprandial glucose and A1c, with the therapeutic goal of using the lowest effective dose; during the first year, check liver enzymes every 3 months due to dose-related transaminase elevations, then periodically thereafter; do not rely on 1,5-anhydroglucitol to monitor control because acarbose renders it unreliable, and counsel on diet to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects [^111HutTs] [^112yhrUo] [^115vMh96].

> I will now examine safety interactions and hypoglycemia counseling, since these can derail otherwise good plans. Acarbose monotherapy does not cause hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, the risk increases; if hypoglycemia occurs, treat with dextrose rather than sucrose because acarbose inhibits sucrose hydrolysis; monitor transaminases for hepatotoxicity, especially at higher doses, and review concomitant drugs for potential interactions such as digoxin, which may require dose adjustment due to reduced bioavailability with acarbose [^112yhrUo] [^112Rqwdf] [^111SCoa9].

> Let me synthesize the final, clinically actionable recommendation, and I should double-check that each element aligns with sources. Start acarbose 25 mg with the first bite of each main meal, titrating to 50–100 mg three times daily as tolerated, with a hard cap of 100 mg three times daily for patients heavier than 60 kg; no dose adjustment is required when eGFR is 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher; use the lower end of the maintenance range and close monitoring when eGFR is 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²; avoid acarbose when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or when serum creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL or higher; throughout, monitor renal function, transaminases, and glycemic response, and individualize to the lowest effective dose with ongoing diet education [^111HutTs] [^112yhrUo] [^11258Jmg] [^1138eVQv] [^116mchsx].

---

The recommended acarbose dose for type 2 diabetes is **25 mg orally three times daily with the first bite of each main meal** [^111HutTs] [^115vMh96]. Titrate to 50–100 mg three times daily based on response and tolerance, not exceeding 300 mg/day [^117HtNxC] [^111HutTs]. In renal impairment, **avoid acarbose if eGFR < 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^112yhrUo] or serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL [^112yhrUo]; no dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate impairment, but monitor closely for gastrointestinal side effects [^113duoit].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

- **Initial dose**: 25 mg orally three times daily with the first bite of each main meal [^111HutTs] [^115vMh96].
- **Titration**: Increase to 50 mg three times daily after 4–8 weeks based on 1-hour postprandial glucose and tolerance; further increase to 100 mg three times daily if needed [^111HutTs] [^115vMh96].
- **Maximum dose**: 300 mg/day (100 mg three times daily) [^117HtNxC] [^115vMh96].

---

## Renal impairment considerations

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Acarbose is minimally absorbed; renal excretion increases with impairment, leading to accumulation of metabolites [^115Y8e9i].
- **Severe renal impairment**: Avoid if eGFR < 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL due to limited safety data [^112yhrUo] [^1138eVQv].
- **Mild to moderate impairment**: No dose adjustment required, but monitor closely for gastrointestinal side effects [^113duoit].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Renal function** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Standard dosing; no adjustment required [^113duoit] |
| eGFR < 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL | Avoid acarbose [^112yhrUo] [^1138eVQv] |

---

## Monitoring and precautions

During therapy, **monitor for gastrointestinal side effects** — such as flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort — which are common but usually mild and transient [^112yhrUo]. Also check **liver function**, as acarbose can cause transaminase elevations; monitor periodically, especially at higher doses [^112Rqwdf].

---

## Alternative therapies

Consider **SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists** for patients with advanced CKD or intolerance to acarbose, as these agents offer cardiovascular and renal benefits [^111YPr6n].

---

The standard acarbose dose is **25 mg three times daily with meals**, titrated to 50–100 mg three times daily as tolerated, with a maximum of 300 mg/day [^111HutTs] [^117HtNxC]. Avoid acarbose in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 25–30 mL/min/1.73 m² or serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL) [^112yhrUo]; no dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate impairment, but monitor for gastrointestinal side effects [^113duoit].

### Acarbose and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes with newly initiated insulin therapy [^114uSeLc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

This study was designed to investigate the effect of acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes with newly initiated insulin treatment who had previously been insufficiently controlled with oral antihyperglycaemic agents [haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) ≥ 8%].

Methods

In this 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 163 patients were randomized to receive acarbose up to 100 mg three times a day or matching placebo. Both the groups were newly initiated with insulin, which was adjusted according to blood glucose values. Primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline; changes in daily insulin doses were also assessed.

Results

Mean HbA(1c) was significantly reduced by acarbose compared with placebo (2.31 vs. 1.81%, p = 0.033). Insulin doses were comparable at the end of the study. There was no difference in blood glucose and triglyceride levels between the treatment groups. Postprandial serum insulin levels increased in both treatment arms owing to insulin administration but less so under acarbose. In contrast to the placebo group, an increase in body mass index was prevented for acarbose-treated patients.

Conclusion

As adjunct administration to newly initiated insulin therapy, acarbose enhances the optimization of blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: evidence and uncertainty [^114hzRPs]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The panoply of treatment algorithms, periodically released to improve guidance, is one mean to face therapeutic uncertainty in pharmacological management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, especially after metformin failure. Failure of recent guidelines to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity may generate further uncertainty, given the frequent association of type 2 diabetes with common comorbidity, including, although not limited to obesity, cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, and frailty. The Italian Association of Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi, AMD) recognized the need to develop personalized treatment plans for people with type 2 diabetes, taking into account the patients' individual profile (phenotype), with the objective of the safest possible glycemic control. As not every subject with type 2 diabetes benefits from intensive glycemic control, flexible regimens of treatment with diabetes drugs (including insulin) are needed for reaching individualized glycemic goals. Whether personalized diabetology will improve the quality healthcare practice of diabetes management is unknown, but specific research has been launched.

### Is there evidence of any safety differences among DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduced GFR due to chronic kidney disease? [^112FLBQN]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Finally, with regard to the risk of hypoglycemia with DPP-4 inhibitors, if the dose is not adjusted according to the label in patients with moderate/severe RI, it should be appreciated that DPP-4 inhibitors do not enhance hypoglycemia risk per se because elevations in glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose insulinotropic polypeptide modulate insulin and glucagon secretion in a glucose-sensitive manner.

Thus, recommendations to reduce the dose or dose frequency of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with RI are not based on a risk of adverse effects or renal toxicity, but are aimed towards achieving drug exposure that yields the maximum efficacy. Of interest, in a study in which vildagliptin was dosed at either 50 mg once or twice daily in patients with ESRD, both dosing regimens were well tolerated, with no clinically important differences noted between doses with respect to adverse events. Thus, any concern that accumulation of vildagliptin (or its renally excreted metabolites) results in an increase in renal or other toxicities is not supported by data. To our knowledge, this is also true for the entire DPP-4 inhibitor class.

In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibitors represent an appealing treatment option for the management of blood glucose control in people with T2DM and CKD. There is a wealth of literature, clinical experience, and regulatory review indicating that there is no evidence of any safety differences between the various individual agents within the class. It is important to remember that there is a continuum of renal function in patients with diabetes, with declining renal function associated with increasing age. As renal kidney dysfunction progresses, there is an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury, falls, frailty, and mortality. Furthermore, in association with progressive RI, some coexisting conditions become more common and increase in severity, while the risk of adverse events associated with commonly used drugs such as metformin increases with declining renal function, in addition progression to ESRD can also occur in a small but significant group of people. The routine monitoring of renal function thus represents good clinical care of people with diabetes, beyond an appropriate dose adjustment of DPP-4 inhibitor. While there may be differences in the pharmacological profiles of the individual DPP-4 inhibitors in relation to renal function, there is no evidence that these translate into differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and nephrotoxic potential.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^113AFdTY]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetes and many diabetic complications are particularly common in elderly individuals. Acarbose has been safely used in elderly patients. A randomised controlled trial of 192 patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥ 65 years found that acarbose monotherapy controlled blood-glucose levels, with no cases of hypoglycaemia reported and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs during the study. A large postmarketing surveillance study confirmed that acarbose is effective at controlling blood-glucose levels in elderly patients, and also found that the incidence of adverse events with acarbose was low and independent of age. Clinical observations also show that elderly patients receiving acarbose report fewer problems with constipation.

Diabetes accounts for 44% of new cases of end-stage renal disease, making it a leading cause of nephropathy. However, there are few data available regarding the use of acarbose in patients with renal disease. Current recommendations therefore state that acarbose should not be given to patients with severe renal impairment. A number of other therapies are contraindicated in this patient population; for example, the use of metformin in patients with renal impairment is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, which can be fatal.

The long-term safety of acarbose has been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials and in postmarketing surveillance studies. In the randomised, double-blind UKPDS, patients visited hospital-based clinics at 4-month intervals. Acarbose, in combination with other antidiabetes therapies, maintained a good safety profile over 3 years. A 2-year, more-closely monitored trial in 74 patients with diabetes reported a similar level of adverse events as the UKPDS, and no serious adverse events were considered to be related to acarbose. Safety in an IGT population was demonstrated by STOP-NIDDM, over a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. By extrapolation – and in contrast to treatment with metformin or thiazolidine – no laboratory safety monitoring is required when treatment with acarbose is initiated.

### Acarbose [^111VxZfG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The 300 mg t.i.d. acarbose regimen was superior to lower doses, but there were no statistically significant differences from 50 to 200 mg t.i.d.

Clinical Experience in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients on Monotherapy, or in Combination with Sulfonylureas, Metformin or Insulin

Acarbose was studied as monotherapy and as combination therapy to sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin treatment. The treatment effects on HbA1c levels and one-hour postprandial glucose levels are summarized for four placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized studies conducted in the United States in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The placebo-subtracted treatment differences, which are summarized below, were statistically significant for both variables in all of these studies.

Study 1 (n = 109) involved patients on background treatment with diet only. The mean effect of the addition of acarbose to diet therapy was a change in HbA1c of -0.78%, and an improvement of one-hour postprandial glucose of -74.4 mg/dL.

In Study 2 (n = 137), the mean effect of the addition of acarbose to maximum sulfonylurea therapy was a change in HbA1c of -0.54%, and an improvement of one-hour postprandial glucose of -33.5 mg/dL.

### Drug development perspective on pharmacokinetic studies of new drugs in patients with renal impairment [^116pRvEc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Severe renal impairment can, through diverse mechanisms, alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs that are renally eliminated and even of some drugs that are nonrenally eliminated. Consequently, dose adjustment for new molecular entities in patients with renal insufficiency is a critical issue in drug development. Clinical pharmacology studies undertaken in patients with renal impairment are generally quite small. We therefore recommend that all pertinent pharmacokinetic data relating to subjects with different degrees of renal impairment and from different clinical trials, including population pharmacokinetic evaluation, form the basis for dosage recommendations in renal impairment. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation has gained popularity for renal insufficiency classification, but traditional equations such as the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) formula should enjoy continued use so as to avoid confusion, particularly for drugs for which dosing guidelines have previously been developed.

### Acarbose [^115Y8e9i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

The fraction of acarbose that is absorbed as intact drug is almost completely excreted by the kidneys. When acarbose was given intravenously, 89% of the dose was recovered in the urine as active drug within 48 hours. In contrast, less than 2% of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as active (that is, parent compound and active metabolite) drug. This is consistent with the low bioavailability of the parent drug. The plasma elimination half-life of acarbose activity is approximately 2 hours in healthy volunteers. Consequently, drug accumulation does not occur with three times a day (t.i.d.) oral dosing.

Special Populations

The mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentrations of acarbose were approximately 1.5 times higher in elderly compared to young volunteers; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²) attained about 5 times higher peak plasma concentrations of acarbose and 6 times larger AUCs than volunteers with normal renal function. No studies of acarbose pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In U.S. controlled clinical studies of acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels were similar in Caucasians (n = 478) and African-Americans (n = 167), with a trend toward a better response in Latinos (n = 132).

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^115vfGZY]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Numerous trials have demonstrated that acarbose is a safe and effective oral antidiabetes agent in patients with diabetes and individuals with IGT. These findings have been confirmed in a wide range of patient populations and in long-term studies. The effect of acarbose on the incidence of type 2 diabetes is comparable to that of metformin, and in addition, acarbose is the only OAD that has been shown to reduce the risk of prespecified cardiovascular events irrespective of individuals' age and weight. Acarbose has been shown to improve hypertension and a number of cardiovascular risk factors, and may have long-term benefits for patients with metabolic syndrome. These properties can be attributed to the mode of action of acarbose, which directly targets postprandial hyperglycaemia and avoids several common side-effects associated with other antidiabetes medications. The most common side-effects that affect compliance with acarbose therapy are mild-to-moderate GI events, and these can be minimised if appropriate stepwise-dosing regimens are used at the start of treatment. However, acarbose has an excellent safety profile. Acarbose is therefore a valuable option for the management of type 2 diabetes and, as the only oral antidiabetes agent approved for the treatment of prediabetes, can help to improve clinical management across the dysglycaemic disease continuum.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment: a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111sNXSU]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes, predominantly type 2, is reaching epidemic proportions, with global prevalence estimated to increase from 8.3%, affecting 366 million adults in 2011, to 9.9% or 552 million adults, by 2030. Concurrent with this increase, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide. Diabetes has been identified as the leading cause of CKD, which may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or increase the risk of death. This association represents an increasing burden for patients and health care systems, particularly in developing countries.

Standards of diabetes care recommend reducing the risk, or slowing the progression, of CKD by optimizing glycemic control. However, most drugs available to treat hyperglycemia are affected by kidney function and should therefore be either avoided or used at reduced doses in patients with CKD. Consequently, there is a great need to focus on optimal diabetes management in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are one of the latest therapeutic classes of glucose-lowering medications. Within this class, linagliptin uniquely has a primarily nonrenal route of elimination, with only ∼5% of the dose being excreted via the kidneys. This contrasts with other DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin that are predominantly cleared by renal excretion. Thus, linagliptin needs no dose adjustment in patients with impaired renal function. Dose adjustment is recommended for sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, including those with ESRD requiring dialysis.

Previous clinical studies have shown that linagliptin achieves clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, metformin/sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. Those studies demonstrated the overall safety and tolerability of linagliptin. The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin compared with placebo when administered in combination with existing glucose-lowering background therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment (RI) over 52 weeks.

CLINICAL TRIALS

Clinical Experience from Dose Finding Studies in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients on Dietary Treatment Only

Results from six controlled, fixed-dose, monotherapy studies of acarbose in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, involving 769 acarbose-treated patients, were combined and a weighted average of the difference from placebo in the mean change from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was calculated for each dose level as presented below:

* Acarbose was statistically significantly different from placebo at all doses. Although there were no statistically significant differences among the mean results for doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg t.i.d., some patients may derive benefit by increasing the dosage from 50 to 100 mg t.i.d.

Although studies utilized a maximum dose of 200 or 300 mg t.i.d., the maximum recommended dose for patients < 60 kg is 50 mg t.i.d.; the maximum recommended dose for patients > 60 kg is 100 mg t.i.d.

Results from these six fixed-dose, monotherapy studies were also combined to derive a weighted average of the difference from placebo in mean change from baseline for one-hour postprandial plasma glucose levels as shown in the following figure:

Cardiovascular risk

Glucose excursions are known to be key mediators of macrovascular and microvascular complications, not only in diabetic individuals but also in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Persons with IGT are almost three-times more likely to develop coronary heart disease and other major cardiovascular events than people with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Acarbose, by benefitting the surrogate markers of CVD (as described above), may be a useful drug for reducing CVD risk (box 1).

Box 1
Effects of acarbose on surrogate markers of CVD

Reduces postprandial hyperglycaemia and glucose excursions
Minimises reactive hypoglycaemia
Improves release of GLP-1
Inhibits platelet activation
Protects kidney function
Has positive effects on lipid profile — increasing HDL cholesterol, decreasing fasting and non-fasting TGs, and LDL cholesterol
Improves vascular health — increases eNOS activity and NO concentrations, reduces oxidative stress and prevents endothelial dysfunction
Promotes weight loss, especially among Eastern populations
Improves blood pressure and decreases risk hypertension.

Hyperglycaemic states play a key role in kidney dysfunction. This is initiated by genesis of glomerular hyperfiltration, which is later succeeded by a state that is characteristically referred to as diabetic nephropathy. This hyperglycaemic damage is known to be worse in patients with existing kidney disease (eg, those having proteinuria as compared to those with normal albumin excretion). This hyperglycaemia-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate has a brisk onset and persists until high glucose levels return to normal. Also, glucose excursions have been demonstrated to stimulate increased collagen production by mesangial cells in vitro, which is a key characteristic of diabetic kidney disease.

Postprandial hyperglycaemia has been shown to be inversely associated with the time interval between diabetes and the development of nephropathy in people with both type 1 diabetes and T2DM. Despite this important relationship between glycaemic control and diabetes-induced kidney dysfunction, the effect of acarbose therapy remains less evaluated, especially in human beings. Most evidence is based on findings observed in animal models.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^1153uEU4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease in older adults — prevalence and cardiovascular burden — are substantial, with dosing cautions for therapy. At least 20% of people older than 65 years have diabetes, and the greatest increase in diabetes prevalence in the coming decades will occur in those older than 75 years. In patients aged 75 years and older with CKD stage 5, cardiovascular disease (CVD) develops in the 2 years before initiation of kidney replacement therapy in more than 90%, with heart failure the most common cardiac condition affecting 71% of patients and ischemic heart disease at 67%. Other comorbidities are more prevalent and adverse effects such as hypotension and hypoglycemia occur more frequently than in younger people; medicines for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia can be used, but they should be started at lower doses and carefully titrated while monitoring for responses and side effects.

### Selection and dosing of medications for management of diabetes in patients with advanced kidney disease [^113sHgHn]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of kidney disease worldwide. A large and expanding array of treatments for diabetes is available to improve glycemic control, including newer classes of drugs, such as thiazolidinediones and incretin-based therapies. The presence of impaired kidney function with reduced glomerular filtration rate should influence choices, dosing, and monitoring of hypoglycemic agents, as some agents require a dosing adjustment in patients with kidney disease and some are entirely contraindicated. This article reviews the clinical use of insulin and other antidiabetic therapies, focusing on pharmacokinetic properties and dosing in patients with advanced kidney disease.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^112RAdJb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Acarbose is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream, and has a low systemic availability of less than 2%. As a result, the risk of any toxic reaction is very low and, to date, no interactions have been reported between acarbose and β-blockers, sulphonylureas, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or warfarin therapy. Some other antidiabetes agents are contraindicated with other treatments; for example, concomitant use of repaglinide with gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering agent that acts by inhibiting cytochromes, can cause prolonged hypoglycaemia.

Acarbose has been associated with rare cases of hepatotoxicity and increased liver enzyme levels, but these have not been confirmed in major trials. A few cases of fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome have been reported; but a causal relationship with acarbose treatment has not been clearly established. A trial of 20 patients with diabetes and either chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis found that acarbose significantly decreased the level of HbA 1c, from 7.2% at entry to 6.3% (P < 0.05) after 8 weeks. More recently, a larger trial of 107 cirrhotic patients with diabetes found that, over 8 weeks, acarbose reduced postprandial glucose levels by about 50%, with no changes in liver function. By contrast, sulphonylureas, metformin and some thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe liver dysfunction.

Elderly people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease — treatment considerations (Weak/Opinion): elderly people with diabetes and CKD often have comorbidities and functional impairments, so the benefits of intensive risk factor management should be considered judiciously; because hypoglycemia and hypotension are particular concerns, less intensive goals should be considered based on individual circumstances. Drug therapies for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia can be used as in other patients with diabetes and CKD, but drugs should be started at low doses and carefully titrated to monitor for responses and side effects. GFR may be a more specific marker of DKD in the elderly compared with albuminuria.

With the exception of liraglutide, all of the GLP-1 RAs can be used without dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity. The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment due to the binding of liraglutide to serum albumin and concomitant hypoalbuminemia. Systemic exposure to liraglutide has been found to be significantly lower (44%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child–Pugh score > 9); therefore, this drug is not recommended in this population.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^116b39KM]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired renal function

When renal function is impaired, drugs cleared by the kidney may not be cleared appropriately, so that blood levels may increase. Metformin and liraglutide are contraindicated when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min. DPP-4 inhibitors when GFR < 50 ml/min are broadly contraindicated (or the dose should be adjusted) but linagliptin can be used at all stages of renal dysfunction. Exenatide and SUs are contraindicated when GFR < 30 ml/min. Acarbose is contraindicated when GFR < 25 ml/min. Insulin is generally recommended when renal failure is advanced, linagliptin being a potential alternative.

In summary, co-morbidities can direct drug use and drug action as well as the risk of drug side-effects. These potential effects will vary from one drug to another and between patients to influence therapeutic decisions.

Individualised targets and therapies

We have already discussed the need to individualize therapeutic targets based on age, complications and co-morbidities and disease duration; the same applies to therapies. For all medications, consideration should also be given to overall tolerability. Even occasional hypoglycemia may be devastating, if severe, or merely irritating, if mild.

Gastrointestinal side effects may be tolerated by some, but not others. Fluid retention may pose a clinical but also, an aesthetic, problem. Substantial individual variation in side-effects, as well as beneficial effects of all agents, influences our approach to the individual case depending on the patient's response. At least one expert has proposed drug-ranging trials to determine the best positive/negative ratio for each agent in any given patient. Adult patients who live alone or have occupations which preclude a degree of risk of hypoglycemia, for example, the elderly, taxi drivers and sportsmen, should avoid insulin, SUs and glinides and favor metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors. Pregnancy or the wish to get pregnant will also preclude the newer drugs, as well as statins, in that the risk associated with them to the fetus is unknown.

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^116mwjGV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Antidiabetic therapy in patients with impaired renal function

Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for 44% of all new cases of kidney failure in 2008 in the United States. The clearance of antidiabetic drugs is decreased and results in prolonged exposure to higher levels of the drug or its metabolites that may trigger adverse events. Observational data suggest that mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal dysfunction increases with HbA1c levels < 6.5% and > 8.0%. Accordingly, HbA1c levels between 6.5% and 7.5% may be a reasonable target for these patients.

A number of antidiabetic drugs are contraindicated in patients when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below variable thresholds, such as 25 ml/min for acarbose, 30 ml/min for exenatide and SU, 50 ml/min for DPP-4 inhibitors and 60 ml/min for metformin and liraglutide. There are scant data on the actual efficacy and safety of diabetes medications depending on patients' renal function. Furthermore, contraindications do not necessarily match with available evidence. This is exemplified with metformin: The label of metformin in the U.S. allows the prescription of metformin at or above 1.4 mg/dl serum creatinine in women and 1.5 mg/dl in men. In Germany, metformin is contraindicated in patients with a GFR < 60 ml/min. In the U.K. prescribing guidelines consider both creatinine and GFR for assessing treatment eligibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends reviewing prescriptions when serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 mg/dl or GFR falls below 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² and to stop treatment at a serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl or a GFR of below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². The uncertainty is mirrored in clinical practice when metformin is prescribed despite full knowledge of the relevant cut-offs. Nevertheless, there is no evidence from prospective comparative or observational studies that metformin confers an increased risk of lactic acidosis. This was shown in a meta-analysis from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies.

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^113Zsoew]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Metformin is, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, usually preferred over other antidiabetic drugs for the first line treatment of type-2 diabetes. The particular decision on which antidiabetic agent to use is based on variables such as efficacy, cost, potential side effects, effects on weight, comorbidities, hypoglycemia, risk, and patient preferences. However, there is no guidance how to consider these in the selection of antidiabetic drug treatment. In this work, we aimed to summarize available evidence and tried to give pragmatic treatment recommendations from a clinical practice perspective. There are clear contraindications for some drugs in those with impaired renal and liver function and precautions in those with heart failure for the use of metformin (NYHA III-IV) and glitazones. On the other hand, GLP-1 analogs, DPP-4 inhibitors and acarbose are generally less critical and can be used in the majority of patients. We identified the following gaps with respect to the selection of antidiabetic drug treatment in patients with co-morbid disease conditions: 1) Guidelines fail to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity. 2) The literature is deficient in studies documenting antidiabetic drug use in patients with severely impaired renal function, diabetic retinopathy, cerebrovascular disease and systolic heart failure. 3) Further there are no specific data on patients with multiple of these co-morbid disease conditions. We postulate that differential use of antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbid disease constellations will help to reduce treatment related complications and might improve prognosis.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^111E5eqh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Acarbose delays the absorption of carbohydrates from the gut.

In 24-week face-to-face comparison trials, similar reductions in the level of glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) were seen for acarbose and metformin (1.1% and 1.0%, respectively), and for acarbose and glibenclamide (1.1% and 0.9%, respectively). The Cochrane review also found that acarbose is at least as effective at controlling postprandial hyperglycaemia as commonly used oral antidiabetics, short-acting insulin secretagogues and the long-acting sulphonylurea glibenclamid. The natural progression of diabetes involves increasing insulin resistance and loss of pancreatic β-cell function, and antidiabetes therapies that trigger insulin secretion therefore fail over time. The mechanism of action of acarbose, however, limits the burden on β-cells, and studies have shown that the effectiveness of acarbose is maintained in long-term treatment, with no secondary failure. A 5-year surveillance study of patients with diabetes found that acarbose reduced 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2 hPG) levels by 3.4 mmol/L and HbA 1c levels by 1.8% from baseline. By contrast, the effectiveness of some other oral antidiabetic drugs, such as glibenclamide, is dependent on adequate β-cell function, and is therefore likely to decline as diabetes progresses, as shown in the UKPDS and other studies.

### Diabetic nephropathy [^117VroPL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

Repaglinide and nateglinide have a short duration of action, are excreted independently of renal function and have a safety profile in patients with renal impairment. These drugs, like the sulfonylureas, are insulin secretagogues, but they act in different cellular membrane channels, and this brings some pharmacological properties such as quick initial action, non-prolonged action and greater effect on post-prandial glycemia. A flexible aspect of this drugs making therapeutic management easier is the lower risk of hypoglycemia because of the different connection of the membrane channels. But one side effect described similar to observed with the sulfonylureas is weight gain. Its cost is higher than that of sulfonylureas, but theoretically it has a less deleterious effect on beta cells. Among the glinides, the first choice would be repaglinide because of the low risk of hypoglycemia, and it can be used in stage 3 and stage 4. Data in the literature are not sufficient to indicate the use of this drug in chronic renal disease stage 5. Nateglinide would be at a disadvantage because it is less potent, and it has active metabolites that can increase the risk of hypoglycemia in subjects with decreased GFR.

Acarbose is a drug that is not potent to reduce HbA1c. However, as its pharmacological action principle is the inhibition of enzyme alpha glycosidase in the small bowel, reducing glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, it is a useful drug to adjust post-prandial hyperglycemia. The metabolism of this drug is practically 100% gastrointestinal, part is excreted in the urine and most of it in the feces, and a small form is excreted in the form of the active metabolite. The concern of using acarbose in subjects with chronic kidney disease is the accumulation of these metabolites that may lead to hepatic lesions. Thus, acarbose would be contraindicated in subjects with chronic renal disease. There are insufficient data in the literature to use this drug with a creatinine greater than 2 mg/dl. It could be considered up to stage 3, and it should be avoided in stages 4 and 5.

### Evidence-based treatment of hyperglycaemia with incretin therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease [^111sLEHu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to the difficulties of evaluating HbA1c levels in CKD, specific glycaemic targets for diabetic patients with CKD have not been established. HbA1c levels of ~ 7%, consistent with NKF‐KDOQI guidelines, 19 are recommended if they can be achieved without compromising safety, and most importantly, without increasing the number and severity of episodes of hypoglycaemia. Target HbA1c levels are also uncertain for patients with diabetes on chronic dialysis or with a kidney transplant, and will depend on age, co‐morbidities and the risk of hypoglycaemia. 19, 20 Therefore, the approach to glycaemic management in patients with T2D and advanced CKD should be individualized, taking account of the needs and preferences of each patient, including the presence of co‐morbidities and concomitant therapies. 19

1.3 What are the challenges associated with treating T2D in patients with advanced CKD?

Kidney disease increases the complexity and risks associated with management of T2D. 19 In particular, advanced CKD is an important risk factor for hypoglycaemia, as gluconeogenesis by the kidney is impaired. 21 In addition, hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are reduced in advanced CKD. 22, 23 The risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with CKD is further increased because the drugs commonly used to treat diabetes in these patients, insulin and sulfonylureas (SUs), are themselves associated with a risk of hypoglycaemia. 17 Many glucose‐lowering drugs, including insulin, undergo clearance by the kidney, and therefore require dose adjustments or are contraindicated in patients with advanced CKD. 19 Thus, choices of glucose‐lowering therapies have been limited for patients with T2D with advanced CKD. 24

1.4 What are the treatment options for patients with T2D and advanced CKD?

Only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucose‐lowering drugs in patients with advanced CKD. The number of patients studied with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² is low because these patients are often excluded from clinical trials of glucose‐lowering agents (Table 1). 24 Because cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) follow the approved indications for these agents, this patient population has been under‐represented in the CVOTs (Table 2). 25 There remains a need for effective glucose‐lowering therapies that have shown safety, especially for hypoglycaemia, in patients with T2D and advanced CKD.

2.1.4. Prediabetes: a Continuum of Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Risk

Prediabetes is a continuum of metabolic abnormalities that extend from the metabolic syndrome with high normal glucose through increasingly severe glucose abnormalities, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to just below the diagnostic thresholds for T2D. Metabolic syndrome is defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III; i.e. at least 3 of the following: elevated fasting glucose, triglycerides, or BP; low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL–C], and abdominal obesity). Patients with prediabetes have increased risks of ASCVD, HF, and CKD. It is therefore essential to optimally control BP, lipids, and other CVD risk factors (see below).

Progression from normoglycemia to overt T2D results from a progressive beta-cell defect. Among patients with prediabetes, the incidence of T2D is up to 8% to 11% per year, and roughly half of patients at risk for T2D never develop it. Evidence suggests that intervening early, when dysglycemia is less severe, may prevent progression to T2D or even foster reversion to normoglycemia. Prediabetes therapy is therefore focused on identifying and educating the person at risk with an emphasis on lifestyle modification, weight management, control of CVD risk factors, and efforts to revert to normoglycemia.

Sustained weight loss increases the likelihood of achieving normoglycemia. If a weight loss of at least 5% to 10% cannot be achieved with lifestyle therapy alone, pharmacological and surgical intervention may be considered depending on the patient's underlying comorbidities as well as body mass index (BMI). Although lifestyle therapy is the most effective and durable approach to delaying or preventing T2D onset in patients with prediabetes, pharmacological therapy with metformin, acarbose, or pioglitazone has been shown to decrease the risk of overt T2D. – Accumulating data suggest that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs), and to a lesser extent sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, may be quite potent in delaying or preventing progression to T2D, probably in part through their weight loss effects. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any of these medications to prevent T2D, based on clinical research results, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommend their use in high-risk patients.

### Acarbose [^111SCoa9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug-Drug Interactions

Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that acarbose has no effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of nifedipine, propranolol, or ranitidine. Acarbose did not interfere with the absorption or disposition of the sulfonylurea glyburide in diabetic patients. Acarbose may affect digoxin bioavailability and may require dose adjustment of digoxin by 16% (90% confidence interval: 8 to 23%), decrease mean Cmaxof digoxin by 26% (90% confidence interval: 16 to 34%) and decreases mean trough concentrations of digoxin by 9% (90% confidence limit: 19% decrease to 2% increase). (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

The amount of metformin absorbed while taking acarbose was bioequivalent to the amount absorbed when taking placebo, as indicated by the plasma AUC values. However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking acarbose due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin. There is little if any clinically significant interaction between acarbose and metformin.

### Oral antihyperglycemic agents and renal disease: new agents, new concepts [^111TevE2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, have proved the importance of intensive glucose management in the prevention of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Both trials showed encouraging trends for a decrease in macrovascular complications, and this is being pursued in new studies. These findings have led to more strict goals for glucose control. As glucose levels are aimed to be closer to the normal range, the risk for hypoglycemia also increases dramatically. The choice of the agent therefore is more influenced currently by the risk for hypoglycemia. There are presently four classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. These agents differ greatly in terms of mechanisms of action, efficacy, side effect profiles, and cost. Except for Acarbose, all classes decrease the glycosylated hemoglobin by a similar magnitude: 1.0 to 1.5%. In chronic renal failure, the oral agents that can be used therefore include the insulin secretagogues repaglinide and nateglinide and the thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) with caution. Insulin also can be used safely in renal failure.

In STOP-NIDDM, administration of acarbose was initiated at 50 mg/day and titrated by 50 mg/day every 2 weeks to a maximum of 100 mg three-times daily (or the maximum tolerated dose). The same regimen was used in the UKPDS and a similar regimen was used in a Chinese study, whereas in the PROTECT trial acarbose was titrated from 25 mg three-times daily to 50 mg three-times daily, and finally to 100 mg three-times daily based on efficacy and tolerability. In all these trials, acarbose was shown to effectively reduce hyperglycaemia, and in STOP-NIDDM, acarbose also significantly increased reversion of IGT to normal glucose tolerance (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, these trials demonstrated that the full maximum dose (300 mg three-times daily) is not required in all patients. The mean daily dose in STOP-NIDDM was 194 mg, compared with 201 mg in the 5-year surveillance study. The low prevalence of side-effects in the surveillance study may be explained by the physician tailoring the dose of acarbose to the individual patient in a community setting.

GLP-1 RAs Use in Complicated Diabetes and Special Populations

GLP-1 RA use in patients with cardiovascular complications, renal impairment and hepatic impairment along with their use in elderly, pregnant and lactating women is discussed here along with relevant clinical evidence. Special situations including fasting have been discussed.

GLP-1 RAs Use in Complicated Diabetes

Patients with Cardiovascular Complications

Patients with T2DM are at a higher risk of developing CVD, which in turn is recognised to be the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. Although the use of these agents is encouraged in patients with asymptomatic and stable CAD, there is no clear evidence regarding their usage in acute myocardial infarction. Hence, factors to be considered before/during the use of GLP-1 analogues in such cases could be a pragmatic approach based on prescribing information, available clinical evidence and clinical sense of physicians. The CV safety of GLP-1 RAs was presented in previous sections.

Patients with Renal Impairment

Exenatide and lixisenatide are predominantly cleared by the kidney. Exenatide dosage is not recommended to be increased in patients with an eGFR of 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m². Both exenatide and lixisenatide are contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Although clearance of liraglutide and dulaglutide is predominantly hepatic, administration of these drugs in patients with renal impairment needs to be considered with caution. This is largely because of the GI side effects and risk of associated volume depletion in case of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and brittle renal haemodynamics. The renal safety of GLP-1 RAs has been discussed in previous sections.

Recommendations for the usage of GLP-1 RA in T2DM patients with renal impairment (as per the European label) are presented in Table 22.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Elimination of GLP-1 RAs does not occur mainly by hepatic metabolism. As discussed in the previous sections, exenatide is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, whereas liraglutide and dulaglutide are metabolised endogenously into their component amino acids by general protein catabolism pathways. No specific organ is presumed to be the major route of elimination for GLP-1 RAs. It is important to note that there is limited information available on the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in patients with hepatic impairment. Prescribing information of the respective products advises cautious use in this patient population; however, there is no dosage adjustment recommended. The impact of GLP-1 RAs on hepatic health is presented in the clinical impact section.

### Acarbose (Precose) [^114vXaDc]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with PRECOSE or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of PRECOSE must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d. PRECOSE should be taken three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. PRECOSE should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified. If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced.

During treatment initiation and dose titration (see below), one-hour postprandial plasma glucose may be used to determine the therapeutic response to PRECOSE and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of PRECOSE, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin.

Initial Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of PRECOSE is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d.

### Acarbose: safe and effective for lowering postprandial hyperglycaemia and improving cardiovascular outcomes [^116dPF9A]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Acarbose, an oral AGI, appears to reduce risk of cardiovascular events with a minimal risk for hypoglycaemia. If started at a low dose and titrated slowly, acarbose tends to cause occasional nuisance gastrointestinal side effects that are generally tolerable. Acarbose, as with metformin, should be considered a first-line antidiabetic agent, and is an effective pharmacological option for preventing diabetes in the prediabetic patient. Larger, long-term trials testing acarbose in diabetic patients as well as in other patient populations would be useful to confirm its cardiovascular benefits and safety profile.

### Acarbose [^112yhrUo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If side effects occur with acarbose, they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy. They are most commonly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as flatulence, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort, and generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time.

Laboratory Tests

Therapeutic response to acarbose should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin levels is recommended for the monitoring of long-term glycemic control.

Acarbose, particularly at doses in excess of 50 mg t.i.d., may give rise to elevations of serum transaminases and, in rare instances, hyperbilirubinemia. It is recommended that serum transaminase levels be checked every 3 months during the first year of treatment with acarbose and periodically thereafter. If elevated transaminases are observed, a reduction in dosage or withdrawal of therapy may be indicated, particularly if the elevations persist.

Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking acarbose. Use alternative methods to monitor for glycemic control.

Renal Impairment

Plasma concentrations of acarbose in renally impaired volunteers were proportionally increased relative to the degree of renal dysfunction. Long‑term clinical trials in diabetic patients with significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL) have not been conducted. Therefore, treatment of these patients with acarbose is not recommended.

### Monitoring and management of hyperglycemia in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease [^113Gsvp9]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, and uncontrolled hyperglycemia is directly related to the increased mortality in this setting. As kidney function decreases, it becomes more challenging to control blood glucose since the risk of hypoglycemia increases. Decreased appetite, changes in glycaemia homeostasis, along with reduced renal excretion of anti-hyperglycemic drugs tend to facilitate the occurrence of hypoglycemia, despite the paradoxical occurrence of insulin resistance in advanced kidney disease. Thus, in patients using insulin and/or oral anti-hyperglycemic agents, dynamic adjustments with drug dose reduction or drug switching are often necessary. Furthermore, in addition to consider these pharmacokinetics alterations, it is of utmost importance to choose drugs with proven cardio-renal benefits in this setting, such as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. In this review, we summarize the indications and contraindications, titration of doses and side effects of the available anti-hyperglycemic agents in the presence of advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and dialysis, highlighting the risks and benefits of the different agents. Additionally, basic renal function assessment and monitoring of glycemic control in DKD will be evaluated in order to guide the use of drugs and define the glycemic targets to be achieved.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^116XS76t]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

The side-effect profiles of two different acarbose dosing regimens, compared with placebo, were determined in a multicentre trial of 164 outpatients with type 2 diabetes. A stepwise-increasing regimen, in which acarbose therapy was initiated at 50 mg twice daily and progressed to 100 mg three-times daily, was found to be as effective at reducing postprandial glucose levels as a flat-dosing regimen, in which patients received 100 mg three-times daily from the outset. Both regimens significantly reduced 2 hPG and mean HbA 1c levels (both P < 0.0001 vs placebo). However, the stepwise-dosing regimen was associated with significantly fewer GI side-effects (Figure 5, P < 0.05) that were significantly less persistent than the flat-dosing regimen over the course of treatment. The mean duration of GI side-effects for patients in the stepwise-dosing group was 29 days, compared with 21 days in the placebo group and 42 days in the flat-dosing group (P < 0.05). A 'start low, go slow' stepwise-dosing regimen is, therefore, recommended to minimise side-effects. To minimise the disruptive effects of any GI side-effects, depending on regional dietary habits, some physicians recommend that when initiating acarbose it may be more effective to take the initial once-daily dose with the evening meal, rather than with breakfast.

4 DISCUSSION

In patients with T2D, good glycaemic control is necessary to prevent the micro‐ and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. Establishing this control in patients with co‐morbid renal impairment is complex for a number of reasons, including restrictions in the use of certain treatment options based on their pharmacokinetic profiles. In this clinical setting it is of critical importance to understand whether the efficacy or safety of a potential treatment is affected by impaired renal function so that an appropriate decision can be made regarding drug treatment and dosing regimen.

The most recent combined ADA/EASD 2015 position statement continues to recommend metformin as first‐line therapy in T2D 6; however, subsequent ADA guidance includes severe renal impairment as a contraindication for use, 7 with additional guidance from the FDA stating that metformin may be used in patients with mild impairment and only some with moderate impairment. 8 Concerns regarding the use of metformin in patients with renal insufficiency are due to lactic acid accumulation, and although recent evidence suggests that cautious use of the treatment in mild‐to‐moderate renal impairment may be appropriate, dosage reductions and careful monitoring of kidney function are recommended. 26

In cases where the use of metformin is not appropriate, current treatment guidelines recommend a number of alternative therapeutic options, including sulphonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 RAs; however, many of these commonly used options are also contraindicated or require dose adjustments. For example, the risk of hypoglycaemia is increased due to the accumulation of sulphonylureas and/or their active metabolites, and their long duration of action 27; dose reductions are required for glipizide despite evidence that the kidneys only have minimal involvement in the metabolism of the drug. 28 The DPP‐4 inhibitors sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin all require dose reductions in patients with renal impairment, with only linagliptin not requiring dose adjustment due to minimal renal excretion of the drug. 28 Furthermore, although the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin do not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, there is evidence that they increase the risk of hypovolemic side‐effects and that their glycaemic efficacy is diminished in moderate‐to‐severe renal impairment. 28 In addition, alpha glucosidase inhibitors are not generally recommended for people with renal impairment due to potential accumulation and lack of safety information. 28, 29

PRECAUTIONS

General

Macrovascular Outcomes

There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with acarbose or any other anti-diabetic drug.

Hypoglycemia

Because of its mechanism of action, acarbose when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because acarbose given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when acarbose was added to metformin therapy. Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by acarbose, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by acarbose, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.

Elevated Serum Transaminase Levels

In long-term studies (up to 12 months, and including acarbose doses up to 300 mg t.i.d.) conducted in the United States, treatment-emergent elevations of serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT) above the upper limit of normal (ULN), greater than 1.8 times the ULN, and greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 14%, 6%, and 3%, respectively, of acarbose-treated patients as compared to 7%, 2%, and 1%, respectively, of placebo-treated patients. Although these differences between treatments were statistically significant, these elevations were asymptomatic, reversible, more common in females, and, in general, were not associated with other evidence of liver dysfunction. In addition, these serum transaminase elevations appeared to be dose related. In US studies including acarbose doses up to the maximum approved dose of 100 mg t.i.d., treatment-emergent elevations of AST and/or ALT at any level of severity were similar between acarbose-treated patients and placebo-treated patients (p ≥ 0.496).

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^113qvnVQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Insulin is generally considered to be safe in patients with a reduced kidney function. When there is a reduction of renal function, its half-life is prolonged because of lower levels of degradation. This has been shown to increase the frequency of hypoglycaemic events which may be five times as frequent as in patients without kidney disease.

Available pharmacokinetic and clinical studies suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors may be safe in patients with renal impairment. Because of their variable degree of renal clearance (except for linagliptin), they may however need dose adjustment. Additionally, DPP-4 inhibitors have a decreased risk of hypoglycemia.

As outlined above, glitazones may have a protective effect to either prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease. This drug class may therefore be preferred over other drugs for the treatment of patients with diabetes. It further undergoes hepatic metabolism and has been demonstrated to be effective without an increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, fluid retention may be accentuated and appropriate measures should be taken.

Expert opinion

Impairment of renal function is an important co-morbidity to be considered when selecting antidiabetic drugs (Figure 1). When taking a GFR < 60 ml/min metformin is contraindicated as is liraglutide. Other thresholds apply to DPP-4 inhibitors (< 50), exenatide and SU (< 30) and acarbose (< 25 ml/min). Generally recommended are glitazones, glinides, insulin, and more recently DPP-4 inhibitors, although the dose may have to be adjusted.

### Linagliptin treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes with and without mild-to-moderate renal impairment [^115hTb6e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The findings from this analysis have important clinical implications. Many commonly used glucose-lowering therapies are contraindicated in subjects with RI, depending on their degree of RI, such as acarbose (if eCcr < 25 ml/min) and some sulphonylureas [e.g. glibenclamide (glyburide) if ≥ 3 CKD stages (eGFR < 60 ml/min)]. Owing to reports of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, the use of metformin is also contraindicated in some prescribing guidelines, although this contraindication remains controversial and is often disregarded in clinical practice. Other glucose-lowering therapies may be used at a reduced dose but require periodic renal function monitoring prior to and during treatment to avoid inappropriate dosing; for example, insulin, repaglinide and gliclazide require dose reduction in subjects with severe RI. Thiazolidinediones may be given without dose adjustment and with no additional risk of hypoglycaemia, although side-effects such as fluid retention, weight gain and an increased risk of cardiovascular events and fractures may be exacerbated in subjects with RI. DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and a low incidence of AEs. Saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin require a reduction in the standard clinical dose in subjects with moderate or severe RI, or ESRD–. Reduced doses of these DPP-4 inhibitors improved glycaemic control in these subjects–, although comparisons of their clinical effectiveness with their respective standard dosing regimens are not available. In addition, because renal function will probably change over time, renal function monitoring is recommended prior to initiating treatment with saxagliptin, sitagliptin or vildagliptin and periodically thereafter–. Linagliptin does not require dose adjustment in subjects with any degree of RI–, a recommendation supported by the findings of this analysis and a previous study in subjects with severe RI.

### Diabetes mellitus in dialysis and renal transplantation [^117JeVBE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)

TZDs act by binding and activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. This increases glucose utilisation by adipose and muscle in response to insulin and also suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis.TZDs have been associated with oedema formation and heart failure. This is of particular importance in patients with ESKF who are already at high risk of heart failure and fluid overload. There is conflicting evidence regarding the survival benefit of TZDs in haemodialysis. Rosiglitazone has been shown to increase all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients on haemodialysis. Due to its adverse cardiovascular safety profile, rosiglitazone was withdrawn from the market in the United Kingdom in 2010. A larger study showed that in haemodialysis patients not taking insulin, survival improves with the addition of a TZD.

Pioglitazone is the only remaining TZD available for use in the United Kingdom. It is almost entirely metabolised by the liver; therefore, it does not require dose adjusting in renal impairment. Its use is not licenced for patients on dialysis.

A randomised controlled trial of 83 non-diabetic renal allograft recipients demonstrated that the addition of pioglitazone reduces the progression of carotid intima-media thickness and improves insulin resistance.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose reduce post-prandial glucose peaks by reducing gastrointestinal absorption of glucose. Their use in severe renal impairment has not been examined; therefore, they are not recommended for use in patients with advanced CKD.

### Acarbose [^111HutTs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of acarbose is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d.

Maintenance Dosage

Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of acarbose should be adjusted at 4 to 8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d. However, since patients with low body weight may be at increased risk for elevated serum transaminases, only patients with body weight > 60 kg should be considered for dose titration above 50 mg t.i.d. (see PRECAUTIONS). If no further reduction in postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels is observed with titration to 100 mg t.i.d., consideration should be given to lowering the dose. Once an effective and tolerated dosage is established, it should be maintained.

Maximum Dosage

The maximum recommended dose for patients ≤ 60 kg is 50 mg t.i.d. The maximum recommended dose for patients > 60 kg is 100 mg t.i.d.

Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin

Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Acarbose given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^111tuqc6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Other factors can also impact on the effectiveness of acarbose treatment, and therefore potentially affect compliance. Enzyme activity in the gut varies among individuals and among populations, and can lead to variations in the initial response to acarbose treatment. In addition, because the effects of acarbose are the result of competitive inhibition, acarbose must be present at the active site of its target enzymes at the same time as the ingested carbohydrates. Maximal effectiveness is therefore achieved if acarbose is given within 15 minutes of the start of a meal, and it is recommended that acarbose is taken with the first bite of a meal.

The carbohydrate composition of a meal can also affect the efficacy and tolerability of acarbose therapy. A diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in simple sugars is recommended for most patients with diabetes, but is particularly important for patients receiving acarbose. A very high intake of simple sugars may aggravate GI side-effects, because they may be present in too high a concentration to be absorbed in the upper small intestine. Therefore, if side-effects are reported, dietary management will help to overcome them. Physicians and nurses should explain that GI symptoms are part of the mode of action of acarbose, and usually disappear with continuous treatment.

Safety profile of acarbose

The mechanism of action of acarbose, and its unique, non-systemic pharmacology, avoids several common adverse events associated with other antidiabetes therapies, and consequently, acarbose has few contraindications. For example, hypoglycaemia, which is caused by an excess of insulin, is a limiting factor in near-to-normal control of hyperglycaemia, and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Due to its mode of action, acarbose does not stimulate insulin secretion, and therefore monotherapy is not expected to cause hypoglycaemia. The UKPDS found that there was no difference between acarbose and placebo for the risk of major or minor hypoglycaemic episodes. By contrast, the use of insulin secretagogues (sulphonylureas and glinides) is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. In the UKPDS, the incidence of any hypoglycaemic episode with sulphonylurea therapy was 17.7%; in general, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia with this therapy class is estimated to be 1–2% per year.

Medication management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Patients with CKD have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to reduced renal elimination of drugs, including reduced filtration, secretion, and kidney metabolism. Bioavailability and non-kidney drug clearance may also be altered, especially in more advanced stages of CKD. Drugs that can be used in CKD should be dose-adjusted based on the degree of residual kidney function; the extent of dose reduction typically depends on the level of kidney function, and some medications may be contraindicated in those with severe kidney dysfunction. Most often, as the data to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in patients with CKD is part of the FDA approval process, recommendations frequently rely primarily on the manufacturer's product labeling.

### Cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of acarbose therapy in prediabetes and established type 2 diabetes [^116xywzf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Dysglycaemic disease is one of the most important health issues facing the world in the 21st century. Patients with type 2 diabetes and individuals with prediabetes are at risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. Long-term management strategies are therefore required that are effective at controlling dysglycaemia, well tolerated and, ideally, offer additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-reduction benefits. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose have been well-established in a wide range of patient populations in both clinical and community trials. In addition, acarbose has been shown to reduce cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes and prevent hypertension and CVD in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Acarbose has a very good safety profile and, owing to its straightforward, non-systemic mode of action, avoids most adverse events. The most common side-effects of acarbose are mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal complaints that subside as treatment continues. They can be minimised through the use of an appropriate stepwise dosing regimen and careful choice of diet. Acarbose is therefore a valuable option for the management of type 2 diabetes and, as the only oral antidiabetes agent approved for the treatment of prediabetes, can help to improve clinical management across the dysglycaemic disease continuum.

### Acarbose compared with metformin as initial therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: an open-label, non-inferiority randomised trial [^111EPjCM]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is the only first-line oral hypoglycaemic drug for type 2 diabetes recommended by international guidelines with proven efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. However, little information exists about its use in Asian populations. We aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, extensively adopted in China, compared with metformin as the alternative initial therapy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this 48-week, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with a mean HbA1c of 7.5%, were enrolled from 11 sites in China. After a 4-week lifestyle modification run-in, patients were assigned to 24 weeks of monotherapy with metformin or acarbose as the initial treatment, followed by a 24-week therapy phase during which add-on therapy was used if prespecified glucose targets were not achieved. Primary endpoints were to establish whether acarbose was non-inferior to metformin in HbA1c reduction at week 24 and week 48 timepoints. The non-inferiority margin was 0.3%, with an expected null difference in the change from baseline to week 48 in HbA1c. Analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population. This study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR-TRC-08000231.

Findings

Of the 788 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups, 784 patients started the intended study drug. HbA1c reduction at week 24 was -1.17% in the acarbose group and -1.19% in the metformin group. At week 48, the HbA1c reduction was -1.11% (acarbose) and -1.12% (metformin) with difference 0.01% (95% CI -0.12 to 0.14, p = 0.8999). Six (2%) patients in the acarbose group and seven (2%) patients in the metformin group had serious adverse events, and two (1%) and four (1%) had hypoglycaemic episodes.

Interpretation

This study provides evidence that acarbose is similar to metformin in efficacy, and is therefore a viable choice for initial therapy in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

### Acarbose: safe and effective for lowering postprandial hyperglycaemia and improving cardiovascular outcomes [^111ZinLp]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Currently, there are many different classes of medications to treat diabetes, such as biguanides (metformin), sulfonylureas, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and sodium–glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (to name a few). However, α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are another class of antidiabetic medications, albeit rather neglected, in the treatment of prediabetes/diabetes. Despite this fact, acarbose has recently been recommended in certain guidelines for treating diabetes, receiving preferred status even when compared to other oral glucose lowering drugs, due to its proven ability to reduce cardiovascular events. Additionally, acarbose has minimal risk for hypoglycaemia and, when titrated slowly, is generally well tolerated despite occasional gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence. Acarbose has also been found to improve vascular health and also likely has antiplatelet effects. Lastly, acarbose has been shown to provide euglycaemia, partially by increasing GLP-1 levels and blunting postprandial spikes of glucose and lipid levels.

Information for Patients

Patients should be told to take PRECOSE orally three times a day at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. It is important that patients continue to adhere to dietary instructions, a regular exercise program, and regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.

PRECOSE itself does not cause hypoglycemia even when administered to patients in the fasted state. Sulfonylurea drugs and insulin, however, can lower blood sugar levels enough to cause symptoms or sometimes life-threatening hypoglycemia. Because PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood sugar, it may increase the hypoglycemic potential of these agents. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when PRECOSE was added to metformin therapy. The risk of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be well understood by patients and responsible family members. Because PRECOSE prevents the breakdown of table sugar, patients should have a readily available source of glucose (dextrose, D-glucose) to treat symptoms of low blood sugar when taking PRECOSE in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin.

If side effects occur with PRECOSE, they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy. They are most commonly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as flatulence, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort, and generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time.

Laboratory Tests:

Therapeutic response to PRECOSE should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin levels is recommended for the monitoring of long-term glycemic control.

PRECOSE, particularly at doses in excess of 50 mg t.i.d., may give rise to elevations of serum transaminases and, in rare instances, hyperbilirubinemia. It is recommended that serum transaminase levels be checked every 3 months during the first year of treatment with PRECOSE and periodically thereafter. If elevated transaminases are observed, a reduction in dosage or withdrawal of therapy may be indicated, particularly if the elevations persist.

Renal Impairment:

Plasma concentrations of PRECOSE in renally impaired volunteers were proportionally increased relative to the degree of renal dysfunction. Long-term clinical trials in diabetic patients with significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL) have not been conducted. Therefore, treatment of these patients with PRECOSE is not recommended.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1157QyjE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

Acarbose highlights of practical use

- Acarbose

- Has shown efficacy on the full spectrum of diurnal dysglycemia.

- Is the only oral antidiabetic drug approved in many countries for use in IGT, besides its approval in the treatment of diabetes.

- Provides sustainable glucose control.

- Lowers postprandial hyperglycemia and improves glycemic control.

- Can be combined with other oral antidiabetic drugs and with insulin.

- Has mild to moderate GI side-effects that may be minimized by a stepwise dose regimen.

- Has been shown to be more effective in Asian than in Western populations.

Adaptive changes in the lower smaller intestine, which may take several weeks to occur following initiation of therapy with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), ensure full carbohydrate absorption, mitigate initial gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal distension, flatulence or diarrhea and also seem to affect the release of a variety of gastrointestinal hormones, including stimulating secretion of the key incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, see below). In view of this physiological adaptation process and not infrequent – albeit transient – gastrointestinal side effects, it is advisable to pursue a dosing escalation concept of 'start low, go slow'. A scheme of 50 to 100 mg tid is usually recommended as effective maintenance therapy.

An indirect consequence of reducing postprandial hyperglycemia with acarbose is an increase of insulin sensitivity. It is thought that by blunting post-ingestion plasma glucose excursions, reduced exposure to glucose toxicity and/or reduced postprandial hyperinsulinemia attenuates down-regulation of the insulin receptor and thus reduces insulin resistance. By directly targeting postprandial hyperglycemia rather than acting as a "conventional" hypoglycemic agent, acarbose is not only aiming at the most inappropriately elevated and longest lasting component of aberrant diurnal glucose metabolism in diabetic individuals, but is also suitable for combination therapy with all other blood glucose lowering agents such as metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and insulin.

2.3 Metformin

Metformin is eliminated by the kidneys and has historically been considered unsuitable for use in patients with advanced CKD because of concerns about development of lactic acidosis attributed to metformin accumulation. 31, 32 These concerns were largely based on case reports, and observational studies have not shown the predicted increase in the risk of metformin‐associated lactic acidosis. 33 Consequently, changes to recommendations for metformin use occurred in 2016 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its restrictions for metformin use in CKD following a review of the safety of this agent in patients with impairment of kidney function. 34 For patients with CKD, the guidance states that starting metformin in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m² is not recommended. For patients taking metformin whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be evaluated, and metformin should be discontinued in patients whose eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². 34

Recent evidence suggests that low‐dose metformin (500 mg once‐daily) may be used in patients with an eGFR of 15–30 mL/min/1.73m 2, provided the dosage is adjusted on an individual patient basis and that the drug is stopped during acute illness. 35, 36 However, the FDA has not approved metformin use in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. 37

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^1131pkmQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — drug therapy and hypoglycemia risk is summarized as follows: An overall glycemic goal for people with diabetes of less than 7.0% is very strongly supported, but the major risk for patients attaining HbA1c levels less than 7.0% is increasing hypoglycemia. In CKD stages 3 to 5, hypoglycemia risk increases due to decreased clearance of insulin and some oral agents and impaired kidney gluconeogenesis; about one third of insulin degradation is carried out by the kidney and kidney impairment prolongs insulin half-life. In type 1 diabetes receiving insulin with significant creatinine elevations (mean, 2.2 mg/ dL) there was a 5-fold increase in severe hypoglycemia; therefore, it is imperative that intensively treated patients monitor glucose closely and reduce insulin and oral agent doses as needed to avoid hypoglycemia. For pharmacotherapy, first-generation sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, tolazamide, tolbutamide) generally should be avoided in CKD, whereas among second-generation agents glipizide and gliclazide are preferred agents because they do not have active metabolites and do not increase hypoglycemia risk in CKD. Within the meglitinides, nateglinide has increased active metabolites with decreased kidney function, whereas increased active metabolites do not occur with repaglinide. Metformin should not be given to patients with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 mg/dL or greater in men and 1.4 mg/dL or greater in women because it is cleared by the kidney and may build up with even modest impairment of kidney function, putting patients at risk of lactic acidosis.

α-Glucosidase inhibitors.

α-Glucosidase inhibitors reduce the rate of digestion of polysaccharides in the proximal small intestine, primarily lowering postprandial glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia. They are less effective in lowering glycemia than metformin or the sulfonylureas, reducing A1C levels by 0.5–0.8 percentage points. Since carbohydrate is absorbed more distally, malabsorption and weight loss do not occur; however, increased delivery of carbohydrate to the colon commonly results in increased gas production and gastrointestinal symptoms. In clinical trials, 25–45% of participants have discontinued α-glucosidase inhibitor use as a result of this side effect.

One clinical trial examining acarbose as a means of preventing the development of diabetes in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance showed an unexpected reduction in severe CVD outcomes. This potential benefit of α-glucosidase inhibitors needs to be confirmed.

Chronic kidney disease in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes who are not on dialysis, we recommend annual screening for chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio; in those aged 65 years and older who are in group 3 (poor health, see Table 3) of the framework and have a previous albumin-to-creatinine ratio of < 30 mg/g, we suggest against additional annual albumin-to-creatinine ratio measurements; and for patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, we recommend limiting the use or dosage of many classes of diabetes medications to minimize the side effects and complications associated with chronic kidney disease, with the technical remark that specific dose/ dosing guidance on each class of diabetes medication is provided in Table 7.

### Is there evidence of any safety differences among DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduced GFR due to chronic kidney disease? [^113ktETL]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Renal function threshold and recommended dose of DPP-4 inhibitors in renal impairment patients. b.i.d. twice daily, DPP - 4 dipeptidyl peptidase-4, GFR glomerular filtration rate, o.d. once daily, Rl renal impairment

Unlike linagliptin, with other DPP-4 inhibitors the drug exposure increases with decreasing renal function (Fig. 1). Thus, doses or dose frequencies are recommended to be reduced according to standard renal thresholds. However, changes in renal function should be seen as a continuum; the thresholds from mild to moderate RI and from moderate to severe RI (see Fig. 1 for definitions) are convenient delineations based on definitions of renal function that are in common usage, rather than dictated by clear discontinuities in exposure. For instance, if a patient is seen at one visit with an eGFR of about 55 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a few months later at the next visit with an eGFR at approximately 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the physician needs to be aware of this significant decline in renal function, but its impact on drug exposure will not be anywhere near the doubling of exposure implied by the following dosage strength or frequency recommendations. The labeling for sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin recommends dosage strength adjustments depending on the level of renal function, with presumably no loss of efficacy. Vildagliptin 50 mg efficacy is maintained when the frequency of dosing is reduced from twice daily in patients with normal renal function to once daily in patients with moderate or severe RI, in accordance with its label. The dose adjustments thus require regular monitoring of renal function, which is also good clinical practice because in these patients it is important to closely monitor renal disease progression. Other than the specifications for modifications in dose or dose frequency, there appears to be no difference between each DPP-4 inhibitor with respect to their safety and tolerability in patients with T2DM and CKD.

### Therapeutic considerations for antihyperglycemic agents in diabetic kidney disease [^1121sHiR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease is among the most frequent complications of diabetes, with approximately 50% of patients with ESRD attributed to diabetes in developed countries. Although intensive glycemic management has been shown to delay the onset and progression of increased urinary albumin excretion and reduced GFR in patients with diabetes, conservative dose selection and adjustment of antihyperglycemic medications are necessary to balance glycemic control with safety. A growing body of literature is providing valuable insight into the cardiovascular and renal safety and efficacy of newer antihyperglycemic medications in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor classes of medications. Ongoing studies will continue to inform future use of these agents in patients with diabetic kidney disease.

### Systematic comparison of four sources of drug information regarding adjustment of dose for renal function [^115Wg6Tu]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare advice on dosage adjustment for renal impairment provided by four commonly used secondary pharmacotherapeutic sources.

Design

Systematic comparison of the definitions of renal impairment, recommendations for dosage adjustment, and the evidence in support of these recommendations in four information sources.

Data Sources

British National Formulary, Martindale: the Complete Drug Reference, American Hospital Formulary System Drug Information, and Drug Prescribing in Renal Failure.

Review Methods

Two reviewers independently extracted data on recommendations for dosage adjustment for impaired renal function of 100 drugs often used in our hospital.

Results

The four sources differed in their recommendations for adjustments of dosage and dosing interval. They vary in their definitions of renal impairment; some are qualitative and remain unclear. All sources provide only a general description; the methods on which the advice is based and references for original data are rarely presented.

Conclusions

The remarkable variation in definitions and recommendations, along with scarce details of the methods used to reach this advice, makes the available sources of drug information ill suited for clinical use. The methods used to retrieve information and use data should be described and made available to the reader. Advice on drug prescription, dose and dosing interval, contraindications, and adverse effects should be evidence based.

### Acarbose [^115vMh96]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with acarbose or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of acarbose must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d. Acarbose should be taken three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.

Acarbose should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified. If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced.

During treatment initiation and dose titration (see below), one-hour postprandial plasma glucose may be used to determine the therapeutic response to acarbose and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of acarbose, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin.

### Effects of acarbose versus glibenclamide on MAGE and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 DM… [^117CaAa2]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Patients who were treated with insulin or drugs that promote weight loss, had impaired renal or liver function, had a history of hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia, or women of child-bearing potential without adequate contraception were excluded. All patients provided their informed consent before they were enrolled in this study. After an 8-week period of metformin monotherapy, all patients were randomised to add on either acarbose or glibenclamide. The doses of acarbose and glibenclamide were 50 mg t. i. d. and 2. 5 mg t. i. d., respectively, for 4 weeks and force-titrated to 100 mg t. i. d. and 5 mg t. i. d., respectively, for the last 12 weeks.

A complete 72 hours of glucose monitoring using a continuous glucose monitoring system and meal tolerance test after a 10-h overnight fasting were performed before randomisation and in the end of study. Morning urine samples were collected for measurement of 8-iso prostaglandin F2α, a commonly used parameter of oxidative stress. The primary objectives are the changes of MAGE obtained from CGM and urinary excretion rate of 8-iso PGF2α. The secondary objectives include changes of HbA1c, lipid profiles including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total adiponectin, and high-molecular weight adiponectin.
- Use of chronic insulin therapy;
- Patients with medical conditions that could promote lactic acidosis, such as renal or hepatic disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, e.g. respiratory insufficiency, hypoxemic condition;
