## Question

Why is abdominal cramping occurs in early pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why abdominal cramping occurs in early pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiologic changes in early pregnancy that could drive cramping. Then, I should verify the key pathophysiologic mechanisms, especially prostaglandins and uterine contractility. Next, I will consider mechanical and ligamentous contributors. After that, I need to distinguish physiologic cramping from pathologic causes that present similarly. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful explanation and note red flags that warrant evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: abdominal cramping in early pregnancy is common and often reflects normal adaptation, but it shares features with complications, so I need to keep a broad differential while focusing on physiologic explanations here [^1173Y7v9] [^112jvSNK].

> I will now examine hormonal drivers. Early pregnancy is characterized by rising progesterone, estradiol, relaxin, and human chorionic gonadotropin. These hormones remodel the uterus, soften the cervix, and increase uterine compliance, which can precipitate intermittent cramping as the myometrium adjusts to implantation and early growth of the gestational sac [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the prostaglandin mechanism because it is easy to overgeneralize from nonpregnant physiology. Although prostaglandin excess is classically linked to menstrual cramps, in early pregnancy the corpus luteum and developing placenta modulate prostaglandin signaling; nonetheless, localized prostaglandin activity can still provoke myometrial irritability and low-grade cramping, especially around implantation and early uterine expansion, which aligns with the clinical observation of mild, intermittent cramps in viable pregnancies [^notfound].

> Next, I should review mechanical and ligamentous contributors. As the uterus enlarges from a pelvic to a suprapubic organ, the round ligaments stretch and can cause sharp, transient cramps, particularly with movement or position change; this round ligament pain is a classic benign cause of cramping in the first trimester and is typically self-limited [^1113V9HL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I distinguish physiologic cramping from pathologic mimics. Threatened abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and corpus luteum cysts can all present with cramping, and cramping plus bleeding increases the likelihood of early pregnancy loss, so I should emphasize that new, severe, unilateral, or persistent cramping, especially with bleeding or hemodynamic instability, warrants prompt evaluation with ultrasound and quantitative hCG to exclude complications [^111VneQh] [^112jvSNK] [^111pyVKN].

> Let me synthesize: abdominal cramping in early pregnancy most often reflects three converging processes: hormonal remodeling of the uterus with intermittent myometrial irritability, prostaglandin-mediated focal contractility around implantation and early growth, and mechanical stretch of supporting ligaments as the uterus enlarges. These are typically mild, intermittent, and not associated with heavy bleeding or systemic symptoms, whereas deviations from this pattern should trigger assessment for complications [^114ZL2J2] [^1113V9HL] [^111VneQh].

Abdominal cramping in early pregnancy is most often due to **normal uterine changes** — implantation, stretching of the round ligaments, and early uterine growth — and is typically mild, intermittent, and self-limited [^1113V9HL]. Hormonal shifts, especially rising progesterone, increase uterine relaxation and can cause transient cramping. However, cramping with bleeding, severe or persistent pain, or one-sided pain may signal **complications** such as threatened miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or infection and requires prompt evaluation [^111VneQh] [^116RNHq2]. Most early cramping is benign, but any concerning features warrant ultrasound and hCG testing to exclude pathology [^115VGFxn].

## Physiological causes of abdominal cramping in early pregnancy

Several **physiological changes** in early pregnancy contribute to abdominal cramping:

- **Implantation cramping**: Occurs around 6–12 days after conception as the embryo implants into the uterine lining, causing mild, intermittent cramping [^notfound].

- **Uterine stretching and round ligament pain**: As the uterus enlarges, the round ligaments stretch, causing sharp, transient pains, especially with movement or position changes [^111jUp15].

- **Hormonal changes**: Rising progesterone relaxes uterine muscle, which can cause intermittent cramping or discomfort [^notfound].

- **Gastrointestinal changes**: Slower gut motility and constipation can cause crampy abdominal discomfort [^115A42i5].

---

## Common characteristics of benign cramping

Benign early-pregnancy cramping typically has the following features:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Pain intensity | Mild to moderate |
| Pain quality | Intermittent, crampy, or aching |
| Location | Lower abdomen, often central or bilateral |
| Associated symptoms | Minimal or none; no bleeding or fever |
| Duration | Brief, self-limited episodes |

---

## Potential complications associated with abdominal cramping

While most cramping is benign, some cases indicate **serious complications**:

- **Threatened miscarriage**: Cramping with vaginal bleeding may indicate early pregnancy loss; about 25% of pregnancies have first-trimester bleeding, and not all progress to miscarriage [^111WuuKY].

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: One-sided pain with bleeding or syncope suggests ectopic pregnancy, which is life-threatening and requires urgent care [^116RNHq2].

- **Infection**: Septic abortion or pelvic infection can cause cramping with fever, chills, and foul discharge [^114y2GND].

- **Gastrointestinal issues**: Appendicitis, cholecystitis, or bowel obstruction can mimic pregnancy cramping and require prompt diagnosis [^114jZ7i6].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring medical attention

Patients should seek **immediate care** for:

- Severe or persistent abdominal pain
- Vaginal bleeding or spotting
- One-sided lower abdominal pain
- Fever, chills, or foul-smelling discharge
- Dizziness, fainting, or syncope
- Shoulder pain (possible ectopic rupture)

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When cramping is concerning, **evaluation may include**:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess pain characteristics, associated symptoms, and risk factors [^112jvSNK].

- **Ultrasound**: Determine pregnancy location, viability, and exclude ectopic pregnancy [^113nyDRn].

- **Quantitative hCG**: Track pregnancy progression and help differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies [^113nyDRn].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, urinalysis, and cultures as indicated to exclude infection or other pathology [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Benign cramping**: Reassurance, rest, hydration, and acetaminophen as needed.

- **Threatened miscarriage**: Observation, pelvic rest, and close follow-up; most pregnancies continue without intervention [^notfound].

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Methotrexate or surgical management depending on stability and gestational age [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Antibiotics and, if indicated, evacuation of retained products [^114y2GND].

---

## Conclusion

Abdominal cramping in early pregnancy is **usually benign** and reflects normal uterine and hormonal changes. However, cramping with bleeding, severe or persistent pain, or one-sided pain may indicate serious complications and requires prompt evaluation. Clinicians should provide reassurance, educate patients on red flags, and use ultrasound and hCG testing to exclude pathology when indicated [^115VGFxn].

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy loss:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy loss is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks of gestation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The majority of early pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities, found in approximately 50–82% of cases. The most common are autosomal trisomies, particularly trisomy 15, 16, 21, and 22, along with triploidy, monosomy X, and structural rearrangements. These losses typically occur between 5 and 9 weeks of gestation. Immunologic factors, such as impaired regulatory T cell function or abnormal endometrial decidualization, can disrupt maternal tolerance of the fetus and contribute to EPL. Infections including CMV, HIV, rubella, and malaria have also been implicated, through direct placental infection, immune-mediated disruption, or maternal systemic illness.
- **Epidemiology**: Early pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with about 80% of losses taking place during the first trimester. The true incidence is likely underestimated, as many early miscarriages are not clinically diagnosed and may be misattributed to delayed or heavy menstrual bleeding.
- **Risk factors**: Advanced maternal age is a major nonmodifiable risk factor for early pregnancy loss, with risk increasing significantly after age 35 and reaching over 50% by age 45. Other maternal factors include a prior history of early pregnancy loss, adverse outcomes in previous pregnancies (such as preterm birth, stillbirth), and Black ethnicity. Structural uterine anomalies, such as septate, bicornuate, or unicornuate uteri, as well as fibroids, endometrial polyps, intrauterine adhesions, and subchorionic hematoma increase the likelihood of early pregnancy loss. Endocrine disorders, particularly poorly controlled diabetes, PCOS, and thyroid disease, are associated with higher rates of early pregnancy loss. Among autoimmune conditions, antiphospholipid syndrome and SLE are most clearly associated with recurrent losses. Modifiable risk factors include extremes in BMI, smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use, certain medications (such as prolonged NSAIDs use around conception), and environmental exposures such as air pollution and pesticides.
- **Disease course**: Early pregnancy loss most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, pelvic cramping, abdominal pain, or passage of tissue. Bleeding may range from light spotting to heavy flow with clots or tissue and is often accompanied by lower abdominal or pelvic pain. The combination of moderate to heavy bleeding and cramping is strongly associated with early pregnancy loss. While most patients with early pregnancy loss experience symptoms, up to 38% may be asymptomatic, with pregnancy loss detected incidentally by ultrasound. This form, previously termed missed abortion, is now described as an asymptomatic incomplete abortion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis after early pregnancy loss is generally favorable, with severe complications such as hypovolemic shock and septic miscarriage being rare. Fewer than 5% of patients experience two consecutive losses, and only about 1% have three or more.

### Misoprostol [^116dwhcC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Misoprostol may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take misoprostol with food.

Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take misoprostol. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 8 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor.

Take misoprostol only according to the directions given by your physician.

Do not give misoprostol to anyone else. It has been prescribed for your specific condition, may not be the correct treatment for another person, and would be dangerous if the other person were pregnant.

This information sheet does not cover all possible side effects of misoprostol. This patient information leaflet does not address the side effects of your arthritis/pain medication. See your doctor if you have questions.

### Mifepristone (Mifeprex) [^114oXCr5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain/cramping is expected in all medical abortion patients and its incidence is not reported in clinical studies. Treatment with MIFEPREX and misoprostol is designed to induce uterine bleeding and cramping to cause termination of an intrauterine pregnancy. Uterine bleeding and cramping are expected consequences of the action of MIFEPREX and misoprostol as used in the treatment procedure. Most patients can expect bleeding more heavily than they do during a heavy menstrual period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in U.S. clinical studies with incidence > 15% of women.

One study provided gestational-age stratified adverse reaction rates for women who were 57–63 and 64–70 days; there was little difference in frequency of the reported common adverse reactions by gestational age.

Information on serious adverse reactions was reported in six U.S. and four non-U.S. clinical studies, totaling 30,966 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24–48 hours later by misoprostol 800 mcg buccally. Serious adverse reaction rates were similar between U.S. and non-U.S. studies, so rates from both U.S. and non-U.S. studies are presented. In the U.S. studies, one studied women through 56 days gestation, four through 63 days gestation, and one through 70 days gestation, while in the non-U.S. studies, two studied women through 63 days gestation, and two through 70 days gestation. Serious adverse reactions were reported in < 0.5% of women. Information from the U.S. and non-U.S. studies is presented in Table 2.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^111YHbSp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate in ectopic pregnancy — The emergency physician must be aware of potential side effects, complications, and drug interactions of methotrexate; methotrexate is a cytotoxic agent that acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase and is a potent folate antagonist that blocks DNA synthesis before cell division; rapidly dividing cells, such as trophoblastic tissue, are unable to divide and replicate, and bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal toxicity are possible with complications including stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping; hepatotoxicity has been shown after prolonged methotrexate use and is not relevant in the short-term dosing used for ectopic pregnancy; patients may experience acute pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain that usually resolve with discontinuation of methotrexate and rarely occur with brief use; several drugs need to be carefully monitored during methotrexate use.

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy is a normal physiological event for a woman with a mean gestation period < 15 weeks (range of 6 to 24 weeks).
- **Pathophysiology**: Early pregnancy is a result of conception either naturally or following medical intervention.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of early pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, back pain, pelvic girdle pain, pelvic cavity pain, vulvar itching, varicose veins, pruritus, leg cramp, exhaustion, frequent coughs and colds, migraines, constipation, hemorrhoids, depression, anxiety, and vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding may lead to spontaneous abortion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, mortality associated with legal induced abortion is < 1 per 100,000 procedures.

### Predicting the risk of threatened abortion using machine learning methods: a comparative study [^111WuuKY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Threatened abortion refers to a condition in which a pregnant woman experiences vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping pain before 20 weeks of gestation, but the cervical os remains closed, and the fetus or embryo is still viable. This condition typically occurs in the early stages of pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Although approximately 25% of pregnancies women experience vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, not all bleeding leads to abortion. However, if not treated promptly, it may progress to abortion, thus causing infection or even shock, which poses a significant threat to the health and life of pregnant women. Overall, 25% of all pregnancies involve a threatened abortion, and women with threatened abortion are 2.5 times more likely to experience abortion compared to healthy women.

Threatened abortion is closely associated with various factors, including chromosomes, genes, hormone imbalances, immune factors, maternal health, and environmental influences. Women experiencing threatened abortion often encounter significant stress and require multiple clinical assessments to accurately determine their pregnancy status. Threatened abortion not only poses a threat to the health of pregnant women but may also affect their future fertility. Physiologically, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain can lead to anemia and infections, and if they are untreated, may cause intrauterine adhesions and blocked fallopian tubes, increasing the difficulty of future conception. Psychologically, the immense mental stress and psychological trauma, such as anxiety and depression, can disrupt the endocrine system, leading to hormonal imbalances that affect ovarian ovulation and endometrial changes, which are also detrimental to future fertility.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 200: early pregnancy loss [^113x76H1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Expectant management of early pregnancy loss — use, outcomes, and follow-up are outlined. Because of a lack of safety studies of expectant management in the second trimester and concerns about hemorrhage, expectant management generally should be limited to gestations within the first trimester. With adequate time (up to 8 weeks), expectant management is successful in achieving complete expulsion in approximately 80% of women. Limited data suggest that expectant management may be more effective in symptomatic women than in asymptomatic women. Patients undergoing expectant management may experience moderate-to-heavy bleeding and cramping, and educational materials instructing when and who to call for excessive bleeding and prescriptions for pain medications should be provided; patients should also be counseled that surgery may be needed if complete expulsion is not achieved. For confirmation of complete expulsion, a commonly used criterion is the absence of a gestational sac and an endometrial thickness of less than 30 mm; however, there is no evidence that morbidity is increased in asymptomatic women with a thicker endometrial measurement. Surgical intervention is not required in asymptomatic women with a thickened endometrial stripe after treatment for early pregnancy loss, and the use of ultrasound examination for any diagnostic purpose other than documenting the absence of the gestational sac is not recommended.

### Diagnosis of dengue fever in a patient with early pregnancy loss [^116vLPZZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that causes an influenza-like illness ranging in severity from asymptomatic to fatal. Dengue in pregnancy has been associated with adverse outcomes including miscarriage, preterm birth and fetal and neonatal death. We present the case of a multiparous woman who presented at 9 weeks' gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramping after a 1 month stay in Mexico. She was initially diagnosed with miscarriage with plan for outpatient follow-up. She was readmitted 3 days later with fever, retro-orbital pain, arthralgia, rash, pancytopenia and transaminitis and managed with intravenous fluids and acetaminophen. Of note, dengue serology was initially negative but retesting 2 days later was positive. It is imperative that clinicians have heightened suspicion for dengue in pregnant women with history of travel to or residence in a dengue-endemic area and consistent clinical evidence.

### Relief of pain due to uterine cramping / involution after birth [^114GUHV3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Women may experience differing types of pain and discomfort following birth, including cramping pain (often called after-birth pain) associated with uterine involution, where the uterus contracts to reduce blood loss and return the uterus to its non-pregnant size. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain relief/analgesia for the relief of after-birth pains following vaginal birth.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 October 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing two different types of analgesia or analgesia versus placebo or analgesia versus no treatment, for the relief of after-birth pains following vaginal birth. Types of analgesia included pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Quasi-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

In this update, we include 28 studies (involving 2749 women). The evidence identified in this review comes from middle- to high-income countries. Generally the trials were at low risk of selection bias, performance bias and attrition bias, but some trials were at high risk of bias due to selective reporting and lack of blinding. Our GRADE certainty of evidence assessments ranged from moderate to very low certainty, with downgrading decisions based on study limitations, imprecision, and (for one comparison) indirectness. Most studies reported our primary outcome of adequate pain relief as reported by the women. No studies reported data relating to neonatal adverse events, duration of hospital stay, or breastfeeding rates. Almost half of the included studies (11/28) excluded breastfeeding women from participating, making the evidence less generalisable to a broader group of women. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared to placebo NSAIDs are probably better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 1.91; 11 studies, 946 women; moderate-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may reduce the need for additional pain relief compared to placebo (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.33; 4 studies, 375 women; low-certainty evidence). There may be a similar risk of maternal adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 9 studies, 598 women; low-certainty evidence). NSAIDs compared to opioids NSAIDs are probably better than opioids for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57; 5 studies, 560 women; moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of maternal adverse events (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89; 3 studies, 255 women; low-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may be better than opioids for the need for additional pain relief, but the wide CIs include the possibility that the two classes of drugs are similarly effective or that opioids are better (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.12; 2 studies, 232 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids compared to placebo Opioids may be better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61; 5 studies, 299 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids may reduce the need for additional pain relief compared to placebo (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.82; 3 studies, 273 women; low-certainty evidence). Opioids may increase the risk of maternal adverse events compared with placebo, although the certainty of evidence is low (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.55; 3 studies, 188 women; low-certainty evidence). Paracetamol compared to placebo Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if paracetamol is better than placebo for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, the need for additional pain relief, or risk of maternal adverse events (2 studies, 123 women). Paracetamol compared to NSAIDs Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if there are any differences between paracetamol and NSAIDs for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, or the risk of maternal adverse events. No data were reported about the need for additional pain relief comparing paracetamol and NSAIDs (2 studies, 112 women). NSAIDs compared to herbal analgesia We are uncertain if there are any differences between NSAIDs and herbal analgesia for adequate pain relief as reported by the women, the need for additional pain relief, or risk of maternal adverse events, because the certainty of evidence is very low (4 studies, 394 women). Transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) compared to no TENS Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain if TENS is better than no TENS for adequate pain relief as reported by the women. No other data were reported comparing TENS with no TENS (1 study, 32 women).

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs may be better than placebo and are probably better than opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. NSAIDs and paracetamol may be as effective as each other, whereas opioids may be more effective than placebo. Due to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of other forms of pain relief. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women and ensure greater generalisability by including breastfeeding women. In addition, further research is required, including a survey of postpartum women to describe appropriately their experience of uterine cramping and involution. We identified nine ongoing studies, which may help to increase the level of certainty of the evidence around pain relief due to uterine cramping in future updates of this review.

### Dysmenorrhea [^1156KeHS]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dysmenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation, characterized by cramping lower abdominal pain that occurs before or during menstruation, and is classified as either primary or secondary based on underlying etiology.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of identifiable pelvic pathology and is associated with increased endometrial production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2α, and leukotrienes, which induce intense uterine contractions, ischemia, and pain. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhea results from structural or inflammatory pelvic disorders that contribute to pain through mechanisms such as nerve infiltration, chronic inflammation, or distortion of pelvic anatomy. Symptom severity in both forms often correlates with prostaglandin levels and other local inflammatory mediators.
- **Epidemiology**: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent and commonly undertreated, affecting 50–90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. It is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism and significantly impacts QoL.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include early menarche, long or heavy menstrual cycles, smoking, alcohol use, high stress levels, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and a family history of dysmenorrhea. Increasing age and increasing parity are protective factors. Secondary dysmenorrhea is associated with identifiable pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, Müllerian anomalies, pelvic adhesions, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
- **Disease course**: Symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea typically begin within a few years of menarche, presenting as cramping suprapubic pain that peaks during the first 1–2 days of menstruation and is often accompanied by nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, and headache. Severe cases may also cause sleep disturbances. Secondary dysmenorrhea tends to present later in reproductive life with progressive or atypical pain patterns and is generally less responsive to first-line therapies. Both forms can become chronic and significantly impact QoL, academic performance, and work productivity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Primary dysmenorrhea often improves with age, childbirth, or hormonal therapy and generally responds well to NSAIDs or hormonal contraceptives. Secondary dysmenorrhea may persist or worsen without appropriate treatment, especially in conditions like endometriosis or adenomyosis. Unless adequately treated and followed, dysmenorrhea may progress to a chronic pain syndrome with significant long-term consequences.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^111xEAVg]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea is the most common pathology faced by women of childbearing age, regardless of race, age, and/or economic status. The worldwide prevalence of dysmenorrhea ranges from 45% to 95% in females of reproductive age and 2 to 29% of women experience severe pain. Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful uterine cramping associated with menstruation. It has been both underdiagnosed and inadequately treated and can be classified as primary or secondary dysmenorrhea depending on the etiology.

Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful cramping in the lower abdomen during the menstrual cycle that begins before or at the onset of menses in the absence of an organic cause. Pain with primary dysmenorrhea has a specific cyclic pattern — it is usually most severe during the first day of menses and can last for several days. Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain associated with an underlying pelvic pathology. This pathology can include endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, adenomyosis, fibroids, endometrial polyps, ovarian cysts, congenital anomalies, and complications from intrauterine contraceptive devices. Pain caused by secondary dysmenorrhea is typically more diffuse, constant and may not always sync with the onset of menses.

Although dysmenorrhea is widely prevalent among women of childbearing age, many women do not seek treatment. Furthermore, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are well equipped to diagnose dysmenorrhea, and subsequently educate and treat patients in order to improve their quality of life. Here we present an up-to-date, evidence-based perspective on this topic. The goal of this narrative is to educate providers on first-line pharmacologic treatments for dysmenorrhea and discuss the evidence behind non-pharmacologic interventions. We also aim to review the role of surgical interventions in refractory disease.

Pathophysiology

While the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea is not completely understood; current research suggests that prostaglandins play a major role. During menses, endometrial sloughing releases prostaglandins, stimulating myometrial contraction and vasoconstriction. This subsequently causes uterine ischemia, anaerobic metabolite formation, and hypersensitization of nociceptive fibers. Interestingly, women with dysmenorrhea have higher levels of prostaglandin E2 and F2 in menstrual fluid, further supporting the role of prostaglandins in the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea. Additionally, uterine artery dopplers are elevated during menses in women with dysmenorrhea, most likely due to higher resistance blood flow through the uterine arteries.

Pharmacological Treatment

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents [^1158wHyq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies show that between 41% and 91.5% of young women, school-aged and university-aged, are affected by dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins, is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis, and typically lasting 1–3 days and with a negative physical examination. Secondary dysmenorrhea presents with similar signs and symptoms but is a result of underlying pelvic pathology, for example endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Dysmenorrhea most typically presents as abdominal cramping; however, it can also present with headaches, nausea, vomiting or other generalized symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, but other tests such as a pelvic examination, a pregnancy test and STI screening may be helpful in ruling out other sources of pain. Although the mainstay of treatment for dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, lifestyle changes and complementary/alternative medicine can also be helpful approaches. Lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise and stretching, while complementary alternative medicine include peppermint, cinnamon, ginger and other herbs and supplements. Finally, endometriosis must be considered as a potential cause for secondary dysmenorrhea and would warrant a prompt referral to gynecology.

### Imaging of acute abdomen in pregnancy [^1117bzEj]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The approach to imaging in pregnancy is unique, as it is essential to minimize radiation exposure to the fetus. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are the chief modalities for evaluation of the pregnant patient with abdominal pain. Use of computed tomography should not be delayed when there is a need for early diagnosis. This article discusses test selection and underlying reasoning, with a description of common imaging features of different causes of acute abdominal pain in pregnancy. Also discussed are current evidence-based recommendations for the use of iodinated and gadolinium-based contrast agents and the importance of patient counseling.

### Irinotecan hydrochloride (Camptosar) [^113RK545]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.
Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of CAMPTOSAR.
Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose.
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR.
Lactation
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for at least 7 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Infertility
Advise females and males of reproductive potential that CAMPTOSAR may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.
Contains sorbitol.

### Mifepristone and misoprostol for early pregnancy loss and medication abortion [^11425rza]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Medication regimens using mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective for outpatient treatment of early pregnancy loss for up to 84 days' gestation and for medication abortion up to 77 days' gestation. Gestational age is determined using ultrasonography or menstrual history. Ultrasonography is needed when gestational dating cannot be confirmed using clinical data alone or when there are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. The most effective regimens for medication management of early pregnancy loss and medication abortion include 200 mg of oral mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist) followed by 800 mcg of misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue) administered buccally or vaginally. Cramping and bleeding are expected effects of the medications, with bleeding lasting an average of nine to 16 days. The adverse effects of misoprostol (e.g., low-grade fever, gastrointestinal symptoms) can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antiemetics. Ongoing pregnancy, infection, hemorrhage, undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, and the need for unplanned uterine aspiration are rare complications. Clinical history, combined with serial quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels, urine pregnancy testing, or ultrasonography, is used to establish complete passage of the pregnancy tissue.

### Pregnancy following bariatric surgery-medical complications and management [^114i9Vgz]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical Complications

During the antenatal period, care must be taken to distinguish complications related to bariatric surgery from physiological manifestations of pregnancy. A history of bariatric surgery should not influence the course of labour and delivery. However, whilst bariatric surgery is not in itself an indication for caesarean section, rates of caesarean section do appear to be higher than average in women who have had bariatric surgery. Whilst nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are common in normal pregnancies, in the context of bariatric surgery they may also occasionally represent surgical complications of prior bariatric surgery.

Notable surgical complications during pregnancy of previous weight loss procedures could include small bowel obstruction, internal hernias, gastric band erosion or migration and cholelithiasis. Small bowel obstruction is a well-recognized life-threatening late, albeit rare, complication of bariatric surgery, principally Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and commonly results from internal hernias and sometimes from volvulus or intussusceptions. The clinical presentation of early small bowel obstruction without bowel necrosis can be subtle. Patients typically complain of crampy pain in the left upper quadrant or epigastric region that may radiate to the back. Vital signs, physical examination (barring tenderness over the area of pain) and laboratory studies may be normal. The generally mild signs and symptoms may be mistaken for common and benign pregnancy-related complaints. Thus, the patient's surgical history of bariatric surgery and high clinical index of suspicion are required for early detection of small bowel obstruction. Tachycardia, abdominal distension, and elevated white blood cell counts, liver enzymes, amylase or lipase levels should raise concerns of bowel necrosis or perforation. When a pregnant patient with a history of bariatric surgery and abdominal complaints fails to respond as expected to appropriate treatment of the presumptive cause, she should be expeditiously reassessed, preferably in a centre with specialist bariatric expertise.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

ALGORITHMS TO AID THE RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF FACP

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of FACP by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP, and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction. To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations, conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin. For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation with first-line antispasmodic therapy.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: case of a mistaken acute abdomen-a case report [^117DUCTK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Abdominal pregnancy is categorized as either 'early' (≤ 20-weeks gestation) or 'late' (> 20-weeks gestation) depending on the gestational age at which the diagnosis is made. Abdominal pregnancy is often fatal to both the fetus and the mother and careful management is required in order to save their lives. Although proper diagnosis is needed to improve outcomes, unfortunately the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy is often missed in routine antenatal care. This is partially due to nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, easily palpable fetal parts, fetal malpresentation, pain on fetal movement, and displacement of the cervix. A previous case report of abdominal pregnancy in the DRC has been published. Like in many other reported cases, the diagnosis was made late (after 36 weeks gestation) and the fetus was already dead.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: case report [^112rN9eN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112JX6EG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HAE

Although HAE symptoms generally begin in childhood, the average age at HAE diagnosis ranges from early childhoodand early adulthoodto the early 40s after a long diagnostic delay. Although HAE should occur in both male and female patients in similar proportions, owing to the autosomal dominance of the disease, it seems to be a female-predominant disease, which may reflect the symptom-exacerbating effects of estrogen. Estrogen can activate factor XII conversion to factor XIIa, which can activate the kallikrein pathway, leading to increased bradykinin production. Clinical studies and case reports have indicated that female patients are affected by HAE more severely and experience HAE attacks with greater frequency than male patients.–As a female patient reaches puberty and experiences menstruation, ovulation, pregnancy, and menopause, the severity and frequency of attacks may change owing to normal fluctuations in estrogen. Menstruation, ovulation, estrogen-containing contraceptive use, and estrogen replacement in menopause have all been individually reported to trigger HAE attacks.

Involvement of the GI tract with resultant abdominal pain occurs in 43% to 93% of patients with HAE, and up to 80% of all patients have recurrent abdominal pain. In a study of 149 patients with HAE who experienced 521 HAE attacks with any abdominal symptoms, 49% of the attacks were characterized by isolated abdominal pain. In an additional 33% of the attacks, patients had abdominal pain and symptoms at 1 other location outside of the abdomen. The most common abdominal symptoms were distension (77%), cramping (73%), and nausea (67%), whereas vomiting (21%) and diarrhea (14%) were much less common. However, other studies have reported much higher rates of vomiting (78%) and diarrhea (65%) in patients with abdominal symptoms of HAE.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dysmenorrhoea [^116hLC3f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological problem consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation, which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Research has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs that act by blocking prostaglandin production. They inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandins. The COX enzyme exists in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. More selective NSAIDs that solely target COX-2 enzymes (COX-2-specific inhibitors) were launched in 1999 with the aim of reducing side effects commonly reported in association with NSAIDs, such as indigestion, headaches and drowsiness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of NSAIDs in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in January 2015: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, November 2014 issue), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We checked the abstracts of major scientific meetings and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparisons of NSAIDs versus placebo, other NSAIDs or paracetamol, when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data, calculating odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used inverse variance methods to combine data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women). They compared 20 different NSAIDs (18 non-selective and two COX-2-specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other. NSAIDs versus placeboAmong women with primary dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I(2) = 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. However, NSAIDs were associated with more adverse effects (overall adverse effects: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51, 25 RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence; gastrointestinal adverse effects: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, 14 RCTs, I(2) = 30%; neurological adverse effects: OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs versus other NSAIDsWhen NSAIDs were compared with each other there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety. However, the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials. Non-selective NSAIDs versus COX-2-specific selectorsOnly two of the included studies utilised COX-2-specific inhibitors (etoricoxib and celecoxib). There was no evidence that COX-2-specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs; however data were very scanty. NSAIDs versus paracetamolNSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43, three RCTs, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, though data were very scanty. Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%); a further 31% failed to state their source of funding.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs appear to be a very effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the substantial risk of adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to determine which (if any) individual NSAID is the safest and most effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.

### Immune regulation, maternal infection, vaccination, and pregnancy outcome [^114y2GND]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Infectious Complications Specific to Pregnancy

Septic abortion

Septic abortion is an infection of the products of conception (POC [e.g. fetus, placenta, membranes]) in early pregnancy, before fetal viability. It occurs most commonly after the incomplete evacuation of a spontaneous or induced abortion, in which some or all of the POC remain in the uterine cavity and become infected by ascending polymicrobial vaginal flora. Clinical signs include high fever, severe abdominal pain/cramping, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Before legalized pregnancy termination, septic abortion was a frequently reported complication of unsafe abortion with high rates of maternal mortality. Septic abortion is now rare in the developed world but continues to be a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries.

Septic abortion is diagnosed based on fever and uterine tenderness and is treated by prompt removal of any remaining POC and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The uterus might be softened by the infection, increasing the risk of uterine perforation or uterine atony, which might require a hysterectomy. Pelvic abscess formation is also a risk and could result in hysterectomy and, potentially, salpingectomy and oophorectomy.

A less common cause of intrauterine infection very early in pregnancy (before complete occlusion of the uterine cavity) is ascending infection (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or other organisms) resulting in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Inpatient treatment is recommended for pregnant women with PID, and ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out.

### Exercise during pregnancy… [^111jUp15]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy Musculoskeletal One of the most obvious changes in pregnancy is the alteration of the woman's body. Mechanical changes related to the weight of growing breasts, uterus and fetus, as well as an increase in lumbar lordosis, result in a shift in the woman's center of gravity, which may cause problems with balance. In addition, weight-bearing exercise becomes a greater concern when vertical impact forces, which are usually twice an individual's body weight, are further increased during pregnancy. Sudden movements may exacerbate these mechanical difficulties and increase the potential for injury. Most women report greater discomfort with exercise in the later stages of pregnancy. Abdominal and pelvic discomfort from weight-bearing exercise is most likely secondary to tension on the round ligaments, increased uterine mobility or pelvic instability. Increases in joint laxity may lead to a higher risk of strains or sprains.

During pregnancy, hormonal changes are thought to induce a greater laxity in joints, assisting in the softening of the pubic symphysis to accommodate delivery. One study has demonstrated increased mobility of the metacarpophalangeal joints. 2 However, an increased injury rate in pregnant patients has not been documented. Maternal and Fetal Temperature The metabolic rate increases during both exercise and pregnancy, resulting in greater heat production. Fetoplacental metabolism generates additional heat, which maintains fetal temperature at 0. 5 to

1. 0°C above maternal levels. Theoretically, when exercise and pregnancy are combined, a rise in maternal core temperature could decrease fetal heat dissipation to the mother. Some data suggest a teratogenic potential when maternal temperatures rise above 39. 2°C, especially in the first trimester.

3 Animal studies of the possible teratogenic effect of heat in early pregnancy have demonstrated an increase in congenital abnormalities, particularly midline fusion defects of the central nervous system. Human studies are limited, but a possible increase in relative risk of defects has been noted with hot tub use early in pregnancy. 4 However, in clinical studies, a decrease in maternal body temperature of 0. 3°C occurs in the first trimester, with further decreases of
0. 1°C per month through 37 weeks of gestation. 5 Physiologic changes that may account for this fall in core temperature include increased minute ventilation and increases in skin blood flow, which augment maternal heat dissipation.

### Does acupuncture have a role in the treatment of threatened miscarriage? Findings from a feasibility randomised trial and semi-structured participant interviews [^114KrwFE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Acupuncture was a feasible intervention to offer women, with referral from biomedical health practitioners and women completing the treatment time for the trial. Half of the women approached to participate in the trial exceeded the gestational age limit for entry of 11 weeks. This was an unexpected finding and may require further consideration in future studies. It remains unknown if these women were presenting with vaginal bleeding that had initially commenced after 11 weeks, or if they had been only referred to MAU when bleeding continued or reoccurred at 11 weeks. There were women in the trial that commented they were initially reassured implantation bleeding was normal - they were only referred for further assessment when this bleeding continued. These preliminary findings that women may be presenting in the late first trimester period with threatened miscarriage warrants further exploration in future research to explore if there are benefits to offering women care in second trimester.

In assessing physical and emotional wellbeing this RCT demonstrated that for women receiving acupuncture, there was a statistically significant reduction in the threatened miscarriage symptom that they self-selected as a primary concern (p = 0.04). With these symptoms relating to women's anxiety over vaginal bleeding as well as abdominal cramping and back pain. Due to the small number of women involved in this study and the resulting large confidence intervals these findings require cautious interpretation. However it was interesting that this finding was captured in the interviews, where while women discussed being proactive as reducing their anxiety, those receiving the acupuncture intervention also discussed the relief they felt from specific reductions in symptom in terms of abdominal bleeding, cramping and back pain.

It was interesting to note that, while women in the acupuncture group demonstrated a significant difference in the symptom of primary concern compared to the touch group, there was no corresponding significant difference for the outcomes of general wellbeing. It may be that even when women see improvements in their symptoms they remain concerned about pregnancy loss until they reach the perceived safety of the second trimester. Certainly the women interviewed discussed 'marking time' until they reached the safety of their second trimester; this perception of not being safe until this time may have influenced how women reported their general wellbeing throughout the study.

### Asynchronous twin delivery in uterus didelphys with a 12-week interval: case report and literature review [^112fcJK5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old gravidity patient with 25 +6 weeks of menopause presented to the emergency department (ED) due to vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramping. She was admitted to our hospital four months ago. The records showed: regular menstruation, self-tested urine pregnancy test positive and stop menstruation 50 + d. Early transabdominal ultrasound showed: "uterus didelphys, early pregnancy twin, live fetus, embryo bud size equivalent to 7 +6 weeks, twin embryo are 1.3 cm", which was considered to be simultaneous conception. At this visit, the patient reported colporrhagia 2 days ago and regular abdominal pain 1 h ago. The intensity and frequency of the pain was gradually increasing with pain lasting for about 30–40 s and occurring every 3–5 min. Past history: the patient gave birth to a full-term girl by vaginal delivery in our hospital three years ago. Double cervix and single vagina deformity were found during delivery.

### Medication abortion up to 70 days of gestation: ACOG practice bulletin, number 225 [^117PEEwh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Medication abortion — what to expect and when to seek care describes that most patients will experience bleeding and cramping, with counseling emphasizing that bleeding likely will be much heavier than menses and potentially with severe cramping. Adverse effects commonly associated with misoprostol include nausea (43–66%), vomiting (23–40%), diarrhea (23–35%), headache (13–40%), dizziness (28–39%), and thermoregulatory effects such as fever, warmth, hot flushes, or chills (32–69%). Counseling should include when to contact a clinician for heavy bleeding defined as soaking more than two maxi pads per hour for 2 consecutive hours, and that in rare cases an additional intervention such as uterine aspiration may be needed.

### Conservative management of complete fetal expulsion into the abdominal cavity after silent uterine rupture-case report [^117M4EnV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient retrospectively described repeated episodes of intense cramp-like abdominal and back pain at 20 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. However, she did not show up for examination with these complaints, as they were transient and lasted only a few hours.

She was reffered to our department at 24 weeks and six days due to the finding of oligohydramnios. The uterus was described without any findings of fetal structures. Eutrophic viable fetus presented freely in the amniotic sac in the left subcostal region, normal amount of amniotic fluid, placenta on the posterior uterine wall, 7 cm-large intramural myoma in the region of the lower uterine segment, normal doppler measurement in the umbilical artery. Hospital admission was indicated, fetal lung maturation was initiated, and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) was indicated to verify these findings. According to MRI, a defect of the uterine wall of 6 cm in the area of the right uterine horn and right uterine edge with eversion of the uterine wall adjacent to the placenta was described. The border of the myometrium and placental tissue could not be reliably differentiated, and suspicion of abnormal placental invasion into the uterine wall arose. The fetus was localized in the amniotic sac below the level of the spleen, with no evidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity (see Fig. 1). Throughout the hospitalization, the patient was free of subjective complaints.

Fig. 1
MRI examination at 25 + 0 weeks of gestation. The fetus is localized in the amniotic sac below the level of the spleen

A detailed consultation with the patient in the presence of an obstetrician, neonatologist, and gynaecologic oncologist surgeon followed. Two possible procedures were proposed. First option - delivery immediately after completion of antenatal corticosteroids by elective cesarean section with possible hysterectomy due to the rupture of the uterus and morbidly adherent placenta suspicion. This option minimizes the risk to the mother but is burdened with an uncertain prognosis for the newborn due to severe prematurity at 24 weeks of pregnancy. The second option is an attempt to reach the completed 28th week of pregnancy to reduce morbidity for the fetus due to severe prematurity, with intensive monitoring of the maternal and fetal well-being followed by a planned cesarean section with subsequent hysterectomy for the same reason. Still, it comes with the risk of sudden complications, especially intra-abdominal bleeding with the need for acute surgery, endangering the life of both mother and fetus. The parents chose the second option – conservative management in an attempt of extending the pregnancy.

### Analgesia for relief of pain due to uterine cramping / involution after birth [^1123puEC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Women may experience differing types of pain and discomfort following birth, including cramping after birth pains associated with uterine involution.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of analgesia for relief of after birth pains following vaginal birth.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2010) and the reference lists of trials and review articles.

Selection Criteria

All identified published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing two different types of analgesia or analgesia with placebo or analgesia with no treatment, for the relief of after birth pains following vaginal birth. Types of analgesia included pharmacological and non-pharmacological.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We have included 18 studies (involving 1498 women) in this review. However, only nine of the included studies (with 750 women) reported 24 comparisons of analgesia with other analgesia or placebo and had data that could be included in our meta-analyses. The majority of studies investigated pharmacological analgesics and these were grouped into classes for this review. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine involution as assessed by their summed pain intensity differences (SPID) (mean difference (MD) 4.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.87 to 5.82; three studies, 204 women) and summed pain relief scores (MD 5.94; 95% CI 3.83 to 8.01; three studies, 204 women). NSAIDS were compared with opioids in one small study of 23 women reporting SPID and summed pain relief and found no difference. A larger study of 127 women found NSAIDs to be significantly better than opioids at reducing pain intensity six hours following study intervention (MD -0.70; 95% CI -1.04 to -0.35). Opioids were compared with placebo in three studies that could be included in meta-analyses; one small study of 23 women reporting SPID and summed pain relief and found no difference. One study of 95 women found no difference in pain intensity six hours following the study intervention. A third study of 108 women found significantly more women in the placebo group reported no pain relief than women in the opioid group (risk ratio 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23). Aspirin was significantly better than paracetamol when pain intensity score was assessed six hours after study intervention (MD 0.85; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.41; one study 48 women) at relieving pain from uterine involution. Paracetamol was not better than placebo when pain intensity was assessed six hours after the study intervention in one study of 48 women.

Authors' Conclusions

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) including aspirin were better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. NSAIDs were better than paracetamol and paracetamol was not better than placebo, though numbers of participants for these comparisons were small. Data for opioids compared with NSAIDs and opioids compared with placebo were conflicting, with some measures showing similar effect and others indicating NSAIDs were better than opioids and opioids were not better than placebo. There were insufficient data to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness of opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution. The median year of publication of included studies was 1981; therefore more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of current pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesia at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for primary dysmenorrhoea [^115vpbFA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological complaint consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation, which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Research has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs which act by blocking prostaglandin production.

Objectives

The purpose of this review is to compare all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea with placebo, with paracetamol and with each other to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (11 April 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1st quarter 2003), MEDLINE (1966-April 2003), and EMBASE (1980 - Week 15 2003). Attempts were also made to identify trials from the National Research Register and the Clinical Trials Register. Citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, abstracts of major scientific meetings and included studies were also searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons of NSAID therapies versus placebo, versus other NSAIDs or versus paracetamol when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trials for quality and extracted data, calculating odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Crossover trial data were presented in additional tables and other data were summarised descriptively.

Main Results

In women with dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were found significantly more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 7.91, 95% CI 5.65 to 11.09), though overall adverse effects were also significantly more common (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.09 to 2.12). When NSAIDs were compared with each other or with paracetamol, there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID with regard to either efficacy or safety. However the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials, most of which were unsuitable for meta-analysis.

Reviewer's Conclusions

NSAIDs are an effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the significant risk of adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to determine which (if any) individual NSAID is the most safe and effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^114ZVoaW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint, which may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is likely caused by a variety of, probably partly unknown, etiologies. Effective management of FACP can be challenging owing to the lack of usable diagnostic tools and the availability of a diverse range of treatment approaches. Practical guidance for their selection and use is limited. The objective of this article is to present a working definition of FACP based on expert consensus, and to propose practical strategies for the diagnosis and management of this condition for physicians, pharmacists, and patients. A panel of experts on functional gastrointestinal disorders was convened to participate in workshop activities aimed at defining FACP and agreeing upon a recommended sequence of diagnostic criteria and management recommendations. The key principles forming the foundation of the definition of FACP and suggested management algorithms include the primacy of cramping pain as the distinguishing symptom; the importance of recognizing and acting upon alarm signals of potential structural disease; the recognition of known causes that might be addressed through lifestyle adjustment; and the central role of antispasmodics in the treatment of FACP. The proposed algorithm is intended to assist physicians in reaching a meaningful diagnostic endpoint based on patient-reported symptoms of FACP. We also discuss how this algorithm may be adapted for use by pharmacists and patients.

Management algorithm for undesired pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) outlines initial symptom screening and branching options. The flowchart begins with the question 'Pelvic pain, cramping, bleeding, IUD in place, history of EP?' followed by 'Desires immediate treatment?' Branches include expectant, active medication, and active procedural management, with a decision node 'Serum hCG ≥ 2,000 mIU/mL'. The medication branch specifies baseline testing 'Draw serum hCG on the same day of medication provision' and a follow-up checkpoint labeled '48–72 hours after misoprostol' with terminal outcomes labeled 'Pregnancy resolution complete'. The procedural branch specifies 'Serial hCG testing day of procedure and 24–72 hours later' with a threshold ' ≥ 50% decline from baseline in one day†?' leading to 'Pregnancy resolution complete', and if not met, actions include 'Obtain ultrasonography, including evaluation of adnexa; serial hCG testing' and either 'Empiric methotrexate' or 'Repeat uterine aspiration with post-treatment hCG testing ‡'.

### A rare drug reaction to methotrexate after treatment for ectopic pregnancy [^116AYNbk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancies are commonly diagnosed and treated in physicians' offices. In the hemodynamically stable patient, therapy often includes treatment with methotrexate. Well-known adverse effects of this drug include mucositis, abdominal cramping, and malaise. We report a case of a rare drug reaction after treatment with methotrexate.

Case

A 34-year-old, gravida 2, para 0, at 7 weeks of gestation by last menstrual period was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and treated with methotrexate. The patient had an anaphylactoid reaction shortly after administration of methotrexate.

Conclusion

Methotrexate is a commonly used therapy for ectopic pregnancies in the outpatient setting. Practitioners should be aware of the potential adverse reactions to methotrexate.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Advise patients that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Advise patients about the risks of ectopic pregnancy, including the loss of fertility. Advise them to recognize and report promptly to their healthcare professional any symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, including lower abdominal pain, especially in association with missed periods [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Advise patients about the following concerns and precautions if pregnancy occurs while using LILETTA:

LILETTA will likely need to be removed because leaving it in place may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm labor; however, removal of LILETTA or probing of the uterus may also result in spontaneous abortion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Report promptly to their healthcare professional any symptoms that suggest complications of the pregnancy, including flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, and vaginal discharge or leakage of fluid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Septic abortion may occur. Advise them that if LILETTA cannot be removed or they choose not to have it removed, there may be an increased risk of miscarriage, sepsis, premature labor, and premature delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Effects of exercise during pregnancy on maternal and newborn outcomes [^114ZL2J2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

As the fetus grows, the diaphragm rises 4 cm, the chest cavity expands, and the ribs rise to mitigate the change in the lung space associated with diaphragmatic elevation. A decrease in lung volume leads to an increase in the respiratory rate to meet the body's demand for oxygen. However, lung volume may still decrease, which will cause pregnant women to feel short of breath, especially in late pregnancy.

During pregnancy, the mother undergoes several hormonal changes to support pregnancy and fetal development, and these hormones are mainly secreted by the corpus luteum, placenta, and embryo. For example, in early pregnancy, there is an increase in the secretion of estradiol, progesterone, cortisol, relaxin, and insulin; and in late pregnancy, there is an increase in the secretion of lactogen, thyroid hormones, and prolactin. These hormonal changes will have an impact on maternal cardiovascular function, respiration, the musculoskeletal system, and mental status.

During pregnancy, women may develop various musculoskeletal disorders. The lumbar spine is more anteriorly convex due to fetal, uterine, and breast growth, ligamentous laxity due to relaxin secretion, and fluid retention in connective tissues due to estrogen which predisposes patients to lumbosacral pain. Increased blood volume, altered venous smooth muscle tone, increased intraventricular pressure due to decreased venous return from the lower body by the pregnant uterus, decreased plasma colloid osmolality and genetic susceptibility to lower extremity edema due to decreased serum protein and albumin levels in late pregnancy lead to pain, heaviness, nocturnal cramps and sensory abnormalities in women. In addition, pregnancy and childbirth are considered risk factors for PFD. The risk of urinary incontinence increases with the progression of pregnancy due to altered hormonal status and increased weight of the uterus on the pelvic floor.

During this period, women may experience mood changes. Studies have shown that mood during pregnancy follows a "U" curve, with negative, distressed, and irritable moods being more common in the early and late stages of pregnancy and less common in the middle of pregnancy. In severe cases, they may even lead to depression. Nearly one in five women of childbearing age will suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and pregnancy is a period of particular vulnerability to depression compared to other periods in a woman's life. Postpartum depression is common, but one study reported that the prevalence of depression during pregnancy was 20.7%, compared to only 9.1% at 8 weeks postpartum.

Recommendations from the 2003 clinical policy — anti-D immunoglobulin in early pregnancy: Is the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin indicated among Rh-negative women during the first trimester of pregnancy with threatened abortion, complete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or minor abdominal trauma? Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. Administer 50 μg of anti-D immunoglobulin to Rh-negative women in all cases of documented first-trimester loss of established pregnancy. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against its use in treating threatened abortion or ectopic pregnancy. Level C recommendations. Consider administration of anti-D immunoglobulin in cases of minor trauma in Rh-negative patients. An updated literature search was performed on the topic, excluding abdominal trauma, and no high-quality studies were found addressing this issue, and as a result the patient management recommendations for this question remain unchanged and are not discussed further in this policy update.

### The pregnant patient: managing common acute medical problems… [^1169gkoR]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Common Symptoms During Pregnancy NAUSEA AND VOMITING About one-half of pregnant women have nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. 43 Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy increases the risk of dehydration, poor function, poor weight gain, and, if severe, acute renal failure and impaired fetal growth. Benign nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is the most common obstetric cause and tends to begin by four weeks estimated gestational age and resolve by the end of 12 weeks estimated gestational age. EPIGASTRIC PAIN/GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX Gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in pregnancy and is attributed to progesterone-mediated relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which increases the frequency and severity of gastric reflux. Other conditions that present as heartburn-like discomfort during pregnancy include peptic ulcer disease, preeclampsia.

COUGH Apart from physiologic rhinitis of pregnancy, upper respiratory tract conditions are not usually caused by the normal hormonal, anatomic, and circulatory effects of pregnancy. DYSURIA Although frequency and urgency are normal as the uterus enlarges in the later stages of pregnancy, dysuria may be a result of cystitis, pyelonephritis, or sexually transmitted infections, which can lead to maternal and fetal morbidity. 30, 31 In pregnant women who have more than 100, 000 colony-forming units of one bacterial species on urine culture, starting antibiotics early is necessary to reduce the risk of pyelonephritis, even in those who are asymptomatic. 32–34. LOW BACK PAIN Low back pain often occurs during pregnancy because of musculoskeletal strain from increased lordosis and soft tissue laxity. However, urologic and neurologic red flags.

HEADACHES New-onset headaches or a new type of headache in pregnancy warrants further evaluation to distinguish urgent or emergent causes from common preexisting conditions. 38, 40, 42 Preeclampsia must be ruled out in all pregnant women with headache who are more than 20 weeks' gestation by monitoring serial blood pressures and assessing urine for protein in consultation with a primary maternity care clinician. 40, 42.

### Conservative management of complete fetal expulsion into the abdominal cavity after silent uterine rupture-case report [^116Ht4nV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 43-year-old tercigravida/primipara was referred to the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of Masaryk University and Faculty Hospital Brno due to the oligohydramnios detected in the 24th week of pregnancy. She had a history of right-sided salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy 5 years ago, and laparotomic myomectomy of a 6 cm-large transmural myoma from the posterior wall without the interference of the uterine cavity with plastic suture of the uterine wall and resection of part of the omentum with endometriosis lesions one year later. Spontaneous pregnancy occurred two years after the myomectomy and was ended by an elective cesarean section performed by Pfannenstiel incision at term due to a 7 cm-large myoma in the lower uterine segment forming a birth obstruction. The description of the scar after the previous myomectomy is missing.

The current spontaneous pregnancy appeared two years after the previous cesarean section. In early pregnancy, the patient was treated in our emergency department for cramping pain around the umbilicus and lower abdomen. One gestational sac without embryonic structures in the uterus and a 6 cm-large intramural myoma on the anterior uterine wall were described. In the 13th week of gestation, the patient was referred to our department due to the finding of cystic resistance in the small pelvis. The ultrasound described a viable fetus in the uterine cavity, a 7 cm-large intramural myoma in the right uterine edge, a placenta located on the posterior uterine wall, and a septated cyst 9 × 7 cm above the uterus. The patient was scheduled for an expert ultrasound examination to specify the cyst, but she failed to come for this scan. First and second-trimester screening for fetal malformations was performed in a prenatal diagnostics center, with the description of intrauterine pregnancy without any pathology, apart from a 6 cm-large unilocular cyst on the left side without abnormal vascularization during the first-trimester screening. The last ultrasound examination was the second-trimester scan at 22 + 0 weeks of gestation.

### Can small bowel obstruction during pregnancy be treated with conservative management? A review [^113Qv9QA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is present in more than 85% of pregnant women with SBIO. Due to the nature of pregnancy, abdominal pain can be confused with gastroenteritis or premature labour, whereas vomiting might be treated as hyperemesis gravidarum. Constant and nonremitting abdominal pain should alert practitioners to rule out the possibility of intestinal obstruction, particularly closed-loop obstructions, as the abdominal pain caused by gastroenteritis or uterine contractions is usually associated with periods of remission. Nausea and vomiting persisting into or starting in the third trimester should warrant further investigations to rule out intestinal obstruction.

Physical examination in pregnant women can be challenging and nonspecific due to the gravid uterus. The enlarged gravid uterus might mask abdominal distension caused by SBIO. Intermittent colicky pain caused by the obstructed bowel might be misinterpreted as labour pain. As the obstruction progresses, the uterus may contract due to the underlying irritation. This might confuse obstetricians, who incorrectly diagnose SBIO as early labour with contraction pain. Other clinical signs, such as fever, tachypnoea, hypotension, and tachycardia, usually appear later as secondary manifestations of severe acidosis and infection. Unfortunately, at this stage, this usually means that the bowel is compromised, and it might be too late to offer surgical intervention. All these challenges highlight the clinical difficulties in diagnosing SBIO in pregnant women.

Laboratory tests yield little information besides electrolyte imbalances and impaired renal function in dehydrated patients. Leucocytosis is common during pregnancy, especially in late pregnancy and during labour. However, an increasing trend of leucocytosis over several hours is significant in gravid patients with suspected obstruction and should alert obstetricians to consider other causes.

Radiological imaging, such as X-rays of the abdomen, is used to aid in diagnosing SBIO. Diagnosis may be delayed due to apprehension about using X-ray imaging and exposing the foetus to radiation. However, significant maternal and foetal mortalities associated with acute abdominal emergencies outweigh the potential risk of radiation exposure to the foetus. Sometimes, in the early stage of obstruction, a single film might not be sufficient to diagnose SBIO. However, progressive bowel dilatation or air-fluid levels in serial films obtained at 4–6 h intervals are indicative of SBIO. Previous literature described using contrast studies such as gastrografin or barium studies to diagnose SBIO. This has been gradually phased out in recent years, especially with the widespread availability of advanced imaging modalities such as CT and MRI scans.

### Menstrual cramps in anovulatory versus normally ovulatory cycles-SARS-COV-2 pandemic daily data plus a meta-analysis of cramps and anovulation [^116cSrw8]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Previous research has asserted that ovulation is required for the presence of primary dysmenorrhea. However, there is now substantial evidence showing that it is possible to have menstrual cramps during anovulatory cycles. Ultimately, it is likely that the progesterone-prostaglandin relationship is not the major factor related to primary dysmenorrhea. Thus, primary menstrual cramp characteristics are all significantly greater in same-length anovulatory compared with normally ovulatory menstrual cycles in well-educated community women in their late 20s and early 30s. This prompts a new era of scientific investigation into the relationships of ovarian hormones, the balance of estradiol and progesterone levels and their menstrual cycle-related changes in association with the pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea. These new understandings are likely to lead to more accurate physiological etiology, better prevention and more effective treatment of menstrual cramps that are a significant issue for many, especially younger women/PORA.

### Single serum activin a testing to predict ectopic pregnancy [^116JCFB2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is an important cause of maternal deaths in early pregnancy because most fatal cases result from delayed diagnosis and inappropriate investigation.

Objective

We evaluated whether the measurement of activin A may be useful in the diagnosis of EP in women with unknown pregnancy location.

Design

The study was designed as an open observational study.

Setting

The study was set in a tertiary referral center for obstetric care.

Patients

Patients were women with unknown pregnancy location (n = 536) who had complaints of bleeding, pain, or cramping.

Interventions

Interventions included clinical examination; transvaginal ultrasound scan; human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and activin A measurements; laparoscopy; uterine curettage; and histological examination.

Main Outcome Measures

Main outcome measures were pregnancy outcomes and evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of hCG, progesterone, and activin A as diagnostic tests for the detection of EP.

Results

Pregnancy outcomes included 155 (28.9%) viable intrauterine pregnancies (IUP), 305 (56.9%) first-trimester spontaneous abortion (SAB), and 76 (14.2%) EP. SAB had the lowest (P < 0.0001) hCG and progesterone concentrations, significantly lower than EP (P < 0.001) and IUP (P < 0.001). In EP, levels were significantly (P < 0.001) lower than in IUP. On the contrary, activin A levels were lowest (P < 0.0001) in EP, significantly lower than in SAB (P < 0.001) and IUP (P < 0.001). IUP had significantly (P < 0.001) lower activin A levels than SAB. When evaluated by the receiver operating curve analysis, activin A at the cutoff of 0.37 ng/ml combined a sensitivity and a specificity of 100 and 99.6%, respectively, for prediction of EP. When activin A concentrations were below the cutoff, the positive predictive value for EP was 97.43%, and 0% for concentrations higher than 0.37 ng/ml.

Conclusions

Activin A measurement may identify patients at risk of EP with a high sensibility and specificity.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^1147pgy1]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is the most common pathology women of childbearing age face. It is defined as painful uterine cramping associated with menstruation. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of an organic cause, whereas secondary dysmenorrhea is pelvic pain associated with an underlying pelvic pathology. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea and provide a discussion of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment options. Prostaglandins play a large role in the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea by causing myometrial contraction and vasoconstriction. The first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes, thereby blocking prostaglandin formation, as well as hormonal contraception. Other pharmacologic treatment options include Paracetamol, as well as Gonadotrophic Release Hormone Analogs, which are typically used in the treatment for endometriosis. Non-pharmacologic treatments with strong evidence include heat therapy and physical exercise. There are less evidence-based data behind other modalities for treating dysmenorrhea, such as dietary supplements, acupuncture, and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, and these methods should be used in conjunction with first-line therapy after a discussion of risks and benefits. Lastly, for women who fail medical management, surgical options include endometrial ablation, presacral neurectomy, and laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation. Further research is needed to measure the socioeconomic burden of dysmenorrhea on the healthcare system and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment combinations, as a multi-modal approach likely provides the most benefit for women who suffer from this condition.

It asks whether the emergency physician should obtain a pelvic ultrasound in a clinically stable pregnant patient with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding and a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level below a discriminatory threshold; in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of β-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy; and, in patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for emergency department management. Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed.

### Outcomes of subchorionic hematoma-affected pregnancies in the infertile population [^115YwUNM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the implications of an incidentally noted subchorionic hematoma on pregnancy outcomes in the infertile population.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care, university‐based facility. All patients with intrauterine pregnancy on initial obstetric ultrasound presenting to an infertility clinic between January 2015 and March 2018 (n = 1210), regardless of treatment cycle, were included. Nonviable pregnancies were excluded. The main outcome measured was association between subchorionic hematoma and first trimester miscarriage.

Results

The prevalence of subchorionic hematoma was 12.5% (n = 151) and did not differ by type of fertility treatment. There was no association between subchorionic hematoma and first trimester miscarriage; however, among patients with subchorionic hematoma, those who reported both bleeding and cramping had an increased probability of miscarriage compared to those without symptoms (0.62 vs. 0.12, P < 0.001). The live birth rate in this sample was 81.3% and there were no statistically significant differences in pregnancy outcomes between those with and without subchorionic hematoma.

Conclusion

Among an infertile population, there was no increased risk of miscarriage when subchorionic hematoma was seen on early ultrasound; however, when patients noted both vaginal bleeding and cramping, their probability of miscarriage was significantly increased.

Participants

Participants were recruited from prenatal care patients at a single tertiary care center in New York, New York. This study was approved by the Columbia University institutional review board (IRB00002973) and was conducted in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants were approached after being introduced to the study by their primary obstetrician and consented to all study protocols prior to research participation. Fifty participants aged 23–41 were recruited and participated in the study from April 8, 2019, to June 17, 2023. Inclusion criteria included being 18 years of age or older, carrying an uncomplicated singleton gestation, and being able to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria included a current in-vitro fertilization pregnancy, multifetal reduction, history of PTB, history of cervical surgery, history of cervical shortening in the current pregnancy, history of significant vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, history of any major abdominal/uterine surgery, history of cesarean section, abnormal pap smear, persistent cramping, persistent uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding at the time of consent, uterine anomalies, systemic or vaginal infections at the time of consent, on progesterone in the first trimester, fibroids, placenta previa or abnormal placentation, ovarian cysts (other than a corpus luteal cyst), and anything in vaginal canal in last 24 hours at the time of the first research visit.

Participant age, height, weight, race, ethnicity, patient history, social history, and obstetric history were recorded. At each prenatal research visit, participants reported their weight, pregnancy complications since their last visit, and whether they'd had intercourse or other vaginal transaction in the past 24 hours (tampon, yeast medication, etc.). After the participant delivered, the gestational age at delivery and mode of delivery (cesarean or vaginal) was recorded.

### Cervical dilation before first-trimester surgical abortion [^113wAbX5]. Contraception (2016). Medium credibility.

Cervical priming and pain during first-trimester surgical abortion — evidence and a cohort study — indicate that studies collected pain data but no study examined pain as a primary outcome; discomfort with laminaria placement occurs more often than with misoprostol, preoperative cramping and abdominal pain occur more frequently with osmotic dilators or misoprostol than with placebo, and this pain is usually described as mild without the need for analgesics; some studies found increased pre- and postoperative pain with prostaglandin analogues or no intraoperative pain benefit versus placebo; higher doses and longer intervals increased preoperative discomfort, and reduced mechanical dilation does not always reduce pain as perceived by the patient. In a prospective cohort of 102 women at 7 to 14 weeks who chose overnight laminaria or same-day misoprostol (400 mcg vaginally 3 to 4 h prior), intraoperative pain on a 5-point scale averaged mean 4.26 in the laminaria group versus 0.74 in the misoprostol group (p < .001), preprocedure pain was 2.44 versus 1.10 (p = .002), and 1 h postprocedure pain was 2.24 versus 0.78 (p < .001), with moderate to severe postoperative pain in 24% versus 4.5%, respectively; in sum, 'cervical priming does not reduce pain before, during or after surgical abortion'.

### Complications in early pregnancy [^112jvSNK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Early in pregnancy women frequently experience nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. Nausea and vomiting can be mild, managed by dietary modifications and medications, or severe, requiring intravenous fluids and medications. Care should be used when selecting medications for nausea to avoid additional side effects or potential harm to the developing fetus. When evaluating vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out. If an intrauterine pregnancy is seen, threatened miscarriage should be considered and the patient appropriately counseled. If neither intrauterine pregnancy nor ectopic pregnancy can be established, a management algorithm for pregnancy of unknown location is presented.

In subjects receiving misoprostol 400 or 800 mcg daily in clinical trials, the most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14–40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13–20% of patients in NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo.

Diarrhea was dose related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days), usually was self-limiting (often resolving after 8 days), but sometimes required discontinuation of misoprostol (2% of the patients). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering after meals and at bedtime, and by avoiding coadministration of misoprostol with magnesium-containing antacids.

Gynecological

Women who received misoprostol during clinical trials reported the following gynecological disorders: spotting (0.7%), cramps (0.6%), hypermenorrhea (0.5%), menstrual disorder (0.3%) and dysmenorrhea (0.1%). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to misoprostol administration. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology. (See boxed WARNINGS .)

### Emergencies in early pregnancy [^1113V9HL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

First-trimester vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from benign conditions to life-threatening complications. This is a difficult topic because it is charged not only with immediate emotional connotations but also with potential long-term effects on the patient's ability to become pregnant again. This article reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and management of implantation bleeding, subchorionic hemorrhage, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, anembryonic pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational trophoblastic disease, and round ligament syndrome.

### Medication abortion up to 70 days of gestation [^112n1jkB]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Medication abortion up to 70 days — expected effects, adverse effects, and emergency thresholds are as follows: Most patients who have a medication abortion will experience bleeding and cramping, and counseling should emphasize that bleeding likely will be much heavier than menses. Adverse effects commonly associated with misoprostol include nausea (43–66%), vomiting (23–40%), diarrhea (23–35%), headache (13–40%), dizziness (28–39%), and thermoregulatory effects such as fever, warmth, hot flushes, or chills (32–69%). Patients should be instructed to contact their clinician in case of heavy bleeding defined as soaking more than two maxi pads per hour for 2 consecutive hours. Among patients who receive mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol, the need for intervention within the first 24 hours is rare, occurring in 0.2% of patients; overall, less than 1% of patients will obtain an emergency intervention for excessive bleeding, and the need for blood transfusion is rare (0.1% of patients or less).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: medication abortion between 14 0 / 7 and 27 6 / 7 weeks of gestation: jointly developed with the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine [^112SBMzE]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Medication abortion between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks — common adverse events and side effects include that existing studies demonstrate a 2% to 20% hemorrhage incidence related to medication abortion, but blood transfusion is rare; mifepristone side effects include vaginal bleeding, uterine cramping, and headaches, and the addition of mifepristone to a prostaglandin appears to lower nausea and vomiting rates compared to prostaglandin alone; misoprostol is associated with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and transient chills and fever, with transient pyrexia occurs in 5% to 10% of patients and fever resolving within several hours of stopping misoprostol; a fever developing less than 1 week after administration is not necessarily due to infection.

### Mifepristone (Mifeprex) [^112cztTA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosing Regimen

For purposes of this treatment, pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period. The duration of pregnancy may be determined from menstrual history and clinical examination. Assess the pregnancy by ultrasonographic scan if the duration of pregnancy is uncertain or if ectopic pregnancy is suspected.

Remove any intrauterine device ("IUD") before treatment with MIFEPREX begins [see Contraindications (4)].

The dosing regimen for MIFEPREX and misoprostol is:

MIFEPREX 200 mg orally + misoprostol 800 mcg buccally
Day One: MIFEPREX Administration

One 200 mg tablet of MIFEPREX is taken in a single oral dose.
Day Two or Three: Misoprostol Administration (minimum 24-hour interval between MIFEPREX and misoprostol)

Four 200 mcg tablets (total dose 800 mcg) of misoprostol are taken by the buccal route.

Tell the patient to place two 200 mcg misoprostol tablets in each cheek pouch (the area between the cheek and gums) for 30 minutes and then swallow any remnants with water or another liquid (see Figure 1).

Patients taking MIFEPREX must take misoprostol within 24 to 48 hours after taking MIFEPREX. The effectiveness of the regimen may be lower if misoprostol is administered less than 24 hours or more than 48 hours after mifepristone administration.

Because most women will expel the pregnancy within 2 to 24 hours of taking misoprostol [see Clinical Studies (14)], discuss with the patient an appropriate location for them to be when taking the misoprostol, taking into account that expulsion could begin within 2 hours of administration.

2.2 Patient Management Following Misoprostol Administration

During the period immediately following the administration of misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Give the patient:

Instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive vaginal bleeding or other adverse reactions occur
A phone number to call if the patient has questions following the administration of the misoprostol
The name and phone number of the healthcare provider who will be handling emergencies.

### Abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome: the cause of localized abdominal pain in a young pregnant woman [^113iZdq9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the broad differential diagnosis in any patient referring with symptoms involving the chest or abdomen, a small number of conditions overshadow the rest by their probability. Chest and abdominal wall pain continues to constitute a common and expensive overlooked source of pain of unknown cause. In particular, cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is commonly encountered but not easily diagnosed unless its specific symptoms are sought and the precise physical examination undertaken.

Case Report

A primigravida woman with unbearable abdominal pain was referred repeatedly seeking a solution for her suffering. Numerous laboratory and imaging studies were employed in order to elucidate the cause of her condition. After numerous visits and unnecessary delay, the diagnosis was finally made by a physician fully versed in the field of torso wall pain. The focused physical examination disclosed abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome as the diagnosis, and anesthetic infiltration led to immediate alleviation of her pain. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Cutaneous nerve entrapment is a common cause of abdominal pain that is reached on the basis of thorough history and physical examination alone. Knowledge dissemination of the various torso wall syndromes is imperative for prompt delivery of suitable care. All emergency physicians should be fully aware of this entity because the diagnosis is based solely on physical examination, and immediate relief can be provided in the framework of the first visit. Wider recognition of this syndrome will promise that such mishaps are not repeated in the future.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: cervical preparation for dilation and evacuation at 20–24 weeks' gestation [^111is1C2]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Cervical preparation conclusions — modalities and procedural implications at 20–24 weeks' gestation — note that "One day of osmotic dilators appears to be sufficient for most D&Es at 20–24 weeks' gestation". The guideline states, "Adjuvant misoprostol does not increase preoperative cervical dilation at 20–24 weeks' gestation, nor does it significantly decrease D&E procedure time when added to overnight dilators", and "Adjuvant misoprostol appears to cause more cramping and pain". It further reports, "Adjuvant mifepristone has been shown to decrease procedure time and improve providers sense of ease of procedure without increasing side effects for D&E at 20–24 weeks' gestation", while "procedure time appears to lengthen and complications increase when mifepristone and misoprostol are used without osmotic dilators at 20–24 weeks' gestation". The document adds, "Patients with a uterine scar undergoing D&E at 20–24 weeks' gestation are at elevated risk of adverse events, but no data exist to attribute the increased risk to cervical preparation", and "While there is evidence that same-day D&E at 20–24 weeks' gestation may be feasible, this practice should be limited to providers with significant experience with these regimens".

### Levonorgestrel (My way) [^116tXmtc]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

What should I do if my menstrual period is delayed beyond 1 week and I have severe lower stomach (abdominal) pain?

If you have severe lower stomach (abdominal) pain about 3 to 5 weeks after taking My Way, you may have a pregnancy outside the uterus, which is called a tubal pregnancy. A tubal pregnancy requires immediate medical treatment, so you should see a healthcare professional right away.

Can I use My Way for regular birth control?

No. My Way should not be used for regular birth control. It is an emergency or backup method to be used if your regular birth control fails or is used incorrectly or if you have sex without birth control. You should protect yourself against STDs and pregnancy every time you have sex. If you have unprotected sex again after taking My Way, it will not help protect you from getting pregnant.

How often can I use My Way?

My Way is meant for emergency protection only, and is not designed to be used frequently. If you find that you need to use emergency contraception often, talk to your healthcare professional and learn about methods of birth control and STD prevention that are right for you.

Will I experience any side effects from My Way?

When used as directed, My Way is safe for women. Some women will have mild, temporary side effects, such as menstrual changes, nausea, lower stomach (abdominal) pain, tiredness, headache, dizziness, breast pain and vomiting. These are similar to the side effects that some women have when taking regular birth control pills. Some women taking My Way will have menstrual changes such as spotting or bleeding before their next period. Some women may have a heavier or lighter next period, or a period that is early or late. If your period is more than a week late, you should get a pregnancy test.

### Metformin vs thiazolidinediones for treatment of clinical, hormonal and metabolic characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome: a meta-analysis [^111Y5DNz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Insulin-sensitizing drugs (ISDs) have been advocated for the long-term treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is therefore important to compare the efficacy and safety of ISDs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) for the treatment of this syndrome.

Methods

A meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness and safety of metformin vs TZDs (including pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) in the treatment of PCOS was conducted, using MEDLINE (1966-May 2010) and EMBASE (1988-May 2010) to select randomized controlled trials comparing clinical, hormonal and metabolic results.

Results

Ten trials were included. TZDs were superior to metformin in reducing serum levels of free testosterone (P = 0.03) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA) (P = 0.002) after 3 months treatment. Decreases in triglyceride levels were more pronounced with metformin after 6 months (P < 0.0001). Decreases in body mass index (BMI) were greater with metformin treatment as assessed at 3 and 6 months (P < 0.00001). There were no significant between-group differences concerning improvements in ovulation, pregnancy rate, menstrual patterns or insulin sensitivity, or changes in serum levels of androstenedione, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein C or insulin. Metformin caused a significantly higher incidence of side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal cramping (P < 0.00001). Significant between-study heterogeneity was detected for several variables assessed.

Conclusions

The findings from this meta-analysis do not indicate that metformin is superior to TZD's for the treatment of PCOS or vice versa. Between studies, heterogeneity was a major confounder. A large scale, well-designed, randomized, controlled trial is needed to further address this issue.

### Outcomes and safety of history-based screening for medication abortion: a retrospective multicenter cohort study [^111A7vER]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

We identified 4 ectopic pregnancies (0.22%; 95% CI, 0.00%-0.45%). One was detected 9 days after mifepristone ingestion after the patient contacted the clinic about unilateral pelvic cramping; the patient was admitted that day to a hospital where a salpingectomy was performed. Two were diagnosed after rising serum β-hCG results and treated with methotrexate; 1 of these may have had a laparoscopic procedure in addition, but full documentation was unavailable. The fourth was reported by an outside physician, but the treatment was unknown and documentation was unavailable.

During follow-up, 9 (0.40%; 95% CI, 0.00%-0.84%) patients were found to have had pregnancy durations greater than 70 days at mifepristone dispensing although not identified at screening (Table 4). Of these patients, 6 had procedures to complete the abortion at 88 to 101 days of gestation, 2 had complete abortions without additional intervention at 16 and 33 weeks, and 1, who received mifepristone at 87 days, had a continuing viable pregnancy at last follow-up contact 3 days after screening. The patient who was estimated to be at 33 weeks of gestation delivered a stillborn fetus at home, brought the fetus to the clinic, and required no further medical care.

### Spontaneous ovarian heterotopic pregnancy [^114XtaDv]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Heterotopic pregnancy is a simultaneous intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy. We report a case of a spontaneous ovarian heterotopic pregnancy. A 36-year-old woman, gravida 7 para 4-1-1-5 at 4 weeks gestation (spontaneous conception), presented to the emergency department with vaginal spotting, lower abdominal cramps with human chorionic gonadotropin(hCG) 10 772 mIU/mL (hCG at T0). Abdominal and pelvic examinations were benign. Transvaginal sonogram (TVS) showed an intrauterine gestational sac and yolk sac, no fetal pole visualised. She was discharged home with a diagnosis of threatened abortion. The patient returned to the emergency department 3 weeks later (T1) at 7 weeks gestation with recurrent vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Her TVS showed an empty uterus with small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac. A small 2cm round mass noted in the adnexa with hCG of 4663 mIU/mL (hCG at T1). Laparoscopy revealed normal fallopian tubes bilaterally and a ruptured right ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Pathology was consistent with ectopic pregnancy. Abnormal hCG patterns should raise suspicion for heterotopic pregnancy.

### Outcomes of subchorionic hematoma-affected pregnancies in the infertile population [^113o3bDf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

SCH was defined as a fluid collection visualized on ultrasound between the gestational sac and the uterine wall. The SCH was recorded as the average size and largest diameter by trained sonographers and all images were reviewed the same day by a Reproductive Endocrinologist. SCH were stratified into small, medium, and large sizes post hoc using the ratio of mean SCH diameter to mean gestational sac diameter with a small SCH comprising < 5% of the gestational sac, a medium SCH comprising 5%–25% of the gestational sac, and a large SCH comprising > 25% of the gestational sac. During the ultrasound appointment, patients were routinely asked about the presence of bleeding or cramping symptoms by the sonographer and documented in the ultrasound report.

Chart review was performed by three reviewers with random cross‐checks to ensure inter‐reviewer consistency. Data on patient demographics, fertility treatments, presence or absence of SCH, symptoms of vaginal bleeding or cramping in the first trimester, and pregnancy outcomes were extracted from the medical record. All fertility treatments were included: natural cycles, oral cycles (clomiphene or letrozole), injectable gonadotropin cycles, hybrid cycles, fresh IVF cycles, frozen IVF cycles, and donor egg cycles. The primary outcome for this study was miscarriage, defined as appropriately decreasing beta‐hCG following a previously documented viable intrauterine pregnancy, a pregnancy ≥ 7 mm without a cardiac activity less than 10 weeks (embryonic demise), or a fetal demise or spontaneous loss of a pregnancy between 10–20 weeks. Secondary outcomes included live birth rate and obstetrical complications.

### Primary dysmenorrhea: advances in pathogenesis and management [^114vLuYW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstrual cramps without any evident pathology to account for them, and it occurs in up to 50% of menstruating females and causes significant disruption in quality of life and absenteeism. Current understanding implicates an excessive or imbalanced amount of prostanoids and possibly eicosanoids released from the endometrium during menstruation. The uterus is induced to contract frequently and dysrhythmically, with increased basal tone and increased active pressure. Uterine hypercontractility, reduced uterine blood flow, and increased peripheral nerve hypersensitivity induce pain. Diagnosis rests on a good history with negative pelvic evaluation findings. Evidence-based data support the efficacy of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and ketoprofen, and estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Cyclooxygenase inhibitors reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids released, with concomitant reduction in uterine hypercontractility, while OCPs inhibit endometrial development and decrease menstrual prostanoids. An algorithm is provided for a simple approach to the management of primary dysmenorrhea.

### Is pregnancy a disease? A normative approach [^111QPgds]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Two questions emerge here. First, how do the risks of pregnancy compare with those of other conditions that are regarded as bona fide diseases? And second, are health risks themselves a sufficient basis on which to designate a condition as a disease?

In order to answer the first question, we can compare pregnancy with measles. Measles is uncontroversially regarded as a disease and treated as such by public health authorities and health professionals. Measles is harmful to nearly all of those who catch it. However, most patients will survive. Very few will die, and only a small proportion will go on to experience longer term impacts on their health. So how do the risks of pregnancy compare against those of measles?

Like measles, pregnancy is a self-limiting condition. It follows a predictable trajectory that usually ends in the patient's recovery. Both pregnancy and measles also involve symptoms that can impair one's normal functional ability. Common symptoms experienced during pregnancy include: back pain, bleeding gums, headaches, heartburn and indigestion, leaking from the nipples, nosebleeds, pelvic pain, piles, stomach pain, stretch marks, swollen ankles, feet and fingers, tiredness and sleep problems, thrush, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, vomiting, morning sickness and weight gain. Like many diseases, including measles, pregnancy is a condition that has distinct stages. The first stage of pregnancy commonly involves many of the symptoms described above. The second stage — labour — will usually involve extreme pain, powerful cramps, and the ripping, stretching and damaging of tissue. This second stage is far riskier than the first, in terms of long-term threats to life and health.

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^113Vj4PV]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Review with patients the signs and symptoms of LILETTA expulsion. Advise patients on how they can check that the threads still protrude from their cervix, and not to pull on them. Advise them that there is no contraceptive protection if LILETTA is displaced or expelled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Advise patients that excessive pain or vaginal bleeding during insertion, worsening pain or bleeding after insertion, or the inability to feel the threads may occur with perforation and expulsion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6)].

Advise patients regarding the risk of ovarian cysts and that cysts can cause clinical symptoms including pelvic pain, abdominal pain or dyspareunia and infrequently will need surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Advise patients that irregular or prolonged bleeding and spotting, and/or cramps may occur during the first three to six months after insertion. If their symptoms continue or are severe, they should report them to their healthcare professional [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Advise patients to contact their healthcare professional if they experience any of the following symptoms or conditions:

Stroke or heart attack
Very severe or migraine headaches
Unexplained fever
Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, as these may be signs of serious liver problems
Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy
Severe vaginal bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, or if they miss a menstrual period
Pelvic pain or pain during sex
Patient or partner becomes HIV positive
Possible exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Unusual or malodorous vaginal discharge
Genital sores
Inability to feel LILETTA's threads

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^113nyDRn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department early pregnancy evaluation — prospective observational study in patients with first-trimester abdominal pain or bleeding presenting to the ED assessed the utility of comprehensive ultrasound, β-hCG, and history and physical for ectopic pregnancy diagnosis, defined ultrasound categories for IUP and ectopic findings, and reported diagnostic outcomes. Indeterminate ultrasound occurred in 72 of 403 (18%) with overall ectopic pregnancy incidence 13%; among indeterminate scans, 15 (21%) had ectopic pregnancy, with risk 10/25 (40%) for β-hCG ≤ 1,000 mIU/mL and 5/47 (11%) for β-hCG > 1,000 mIU/mL. Follow-up limitations included 9% lost to follow-up and a small sample size of patients with β-hCG < 1,000 mIU/mL or indeterminate ultrasound.

### Nausea, emesis, and muscle weakness in a pregnant adolescent [^112FozJi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Gitelman syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that presents in early adulthood with fatigue, muscle cramps and electrolyte abnormalities.

Case

A 17-year-old African-American woman presented at 17 weeks of pregnancy with nausea, emesis, profound lower extremity proximal muscle weakness, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. After a thorough evaluation, Gitelman syndrome was diagnosed. The patient was maintained on high levels of potassium and magnesium supplementation throughout the rest of her pregnancy and delivered a healthy infant.

Conclusion

In pregnancy, nausea and emesis is most commonly attributed to hyperemesis gravidarum. However, an atypical presentation of these symptoms and/or the coexistence of less common complaints warrant further investigation.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116gJujL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) strings not visible and cannot be safely retrieved — evaluation and counseling include to consider ultrasonography to determine IUD location and recognize that an unlocated IUD might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall; if ultrasound is not possible or the IUD is intrauterine, advise prompt care for heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever. Removing the IUD improves pregnancy outcome when strings are visible or retrieval from the cervical canal is safe, and risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place. A systematic review identified nine studies showing greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes when the IUD is not removed; Cu‑IUD removal decreased risks but not to baseline, and in one LNG‑IUD case series, when IUDs were not removed eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions; effects of theoretical hormonal exposure on fetal abnormalities are unknown.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of acute abdominal pain in the pregnant patient [^116eG4Uw]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of a pregnant patient presenting with acute abdominal pain can be challenging to accurately diagnose for a variety of reasons, and particularly late in pregnancy. Noncontrast MR remains a safe and accurate diagnostic imaging modality for the pregnant patient presenting with acute abdominal pain, following often an initially inconclusive ultrasound examination, and can be used in most settings to avoid the ionizing radiation exposure of a computed tomography scan. Pathologic processes discussed in this article include some of the more common gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, and gynecologic causes of abdominal pain occurring in pregnancy, as well as traumatic injuries.

### Emergent MRI for acute abdominal pain in pregnancy-review of common pathology and imaging appearance [^112vJ9BZ]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in pregnancy remains a clinically challenging presentation, often requiring imaging. The threat of morbidity and mortality to both mother and fetus necessitates quick and accurate imaging diagnosis, often via ultrasound. However, many of the common causes of acute abdominal pain are not readily diagnosed with sonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly favored in this setting. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the reader with common pathologies which may be encountered in pregnant females presenting with acute abdominal pain requiring emergent MRI.

### Nifedipine for primary dysmenorrhoea [^113unCTc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea (period pain) is a common condition with a substantial impact on the well-being and productivity of women. Primary dysmenorrhoea is defined as recurrent, cramping pelvic pain that occurs with periods, in the presence of a normal uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. It is thought to be caused by uterine contractions (cramps) associated with a high level of production of local chemicals such as prostaglandins. The muscle of the uterus (the myometrium) responds to these high levels of prostaglandins by contracting forcefully, causing low oxygen levels and consequently pain. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker in widespread clinical use for preterm labour due to its ability to inhibit uterine contractions in that setting. This review addresses whether this effect of nifedipine also helps with relief of the uterine contractions during menstruation OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of nifedipine for primary dysmenorrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nifedipine for dysmenorrhoea, without language restriction and in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Information Specialist. The following databases were searched to 25 November 2021: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Also searched were the international trial registers: ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, the Web of Science, OpenGrey, LILACS database, PubMed and Google Scholar. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing nifedipine with placebo for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcomes to be assessed were pain, and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects, satisfaction, and need for additional medication. The two review authors independently assessed the included trials. There were insufficient data to allow meaningful meta-analysis.

Main Results

The evidence assessed was of very low quality overall. We examined three small RCTs, with a total of 106 participants. Data for analysis could be extracted from only two of these trials (with a total of 66 participants); two trials were published in the 1980s, and the third in 1993. Nifedipine may be effective for "any pain relief" compared to placebo in women with primary dysmenorrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 9.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.61 to 31.31; 2 studies, 66 participants; very low-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of pain relief using placebo is 40%, the rate using nifedipine would be between 64% and 95%. For the outcome of "good" or "excellent" pain relief, nifedipine may be more effective than placebo; the confidence interval was very wide (OR 43.78, 95% CI 5.34 to 259.01; 2 studies, 66 participants; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if the use of nifedipine was associated with less requirement for additional analgesia use than placebo (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.07 to 4.20, 1 study, 42 participants; very low-quality evidence). Participants indicated that they would choose to use nifedipine over their previous analgesic if the option was available. There were similar levels of adverse effects and menstruation-related symptoms in the placebo and intervention groups (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.08 to 10.90; 1 study, 24 participants; very low-quality evidence); if the chance of adverse effects with placebo is 80%, the rate using nifedipine would be between 24% and 98%. There were no results regarding formal assessment of health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is insufficient to confirm whether nifedipine is a possible medical treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials included in this review had very low numbers and were of low quality. Notably, there was a large imbalance in numbers randomised between placebo and treatment groups in one of the two trials with data available for analysis. While there was no evidence of a difference noted in adverse effects between groups, more data from larger participant numbers are needed for this outcome. Larger, more well-conducted trials are required to elucidate the potential role of nifedipine in the treatment of this common condition, as it could be a useful addition to the therapeutic options available if shown to be well tolerated and effective. The safety of nifedipine in women of reproductive age is well established from trials of its use in preterm labour, and clinicians are accustomed to off-label use for this indication. The drug is inexpensive and readily available. Other options for relief of primary dysmenorrhoea are not suitable for all women; NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) are contraindicated for some women, and the OCP is not suitable for women who are trying to conceive. In addition, the trials examined suggest there may be a participant preference for nifedipine.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a condition that can occur after ovarian stimulation, often in the context of fertility treatments. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and assessing the severity of OHSS. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality used to evaluate the ovaries, where findings typically include enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, ranging from small to large, representing enlarged follicles or corpus luteum cysts (Fig. 5). In severe cases, free fluid may be seen in the pelvis or abdomen due to capillary leakage. In more advanced stages, CT or MRI scans may be employed to assess complications such as ovarian torsion, ascites, pleural effusions or other signs of severe OHSS. Particularly, MRI is very helpful in differentiating OHSS from ovarian tumours, including choriocarcinoma, which can also produce high hCG levels, by demonstrating markedly bilateral symmetrically enlarged ovaries with simple cysts of different size, separated by thin septa and lacking inhomogeneous solid tissue consistent with malignancy (Fig. 5).

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^115A42i5]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available published evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This article provides practical advice for the management of pregnant patients with gastrointestinal and liver disease based on the best available published evidence. The Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: To optimize gastrointestinal and liver disease before pregnancy, preconception and contraceptive care counseling by a multidisciplinary team should be encouraged for reproductive-aged persons who desire to become pregnant. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Procedures, medications, and other interventions to optimize maternal health should not be withheld solely because a patient is pregnant and should be individualized after an assessment of the risks and benefits. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Coordination of birth for a pregnant patient with complex inflammatory bowel disease, advanced cirrhosis, or a liver transplant should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, preferably in a tertiary care center. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may reduce progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition to standard diet and lifestyle measures, stepwise treatment consists of symptom control with vitamin B6 and doxylamine, hydration, and adequate nutrition; ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, and intravenous glucocorticoids may be required in moderate to severe cases. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Constipation in pregnant persons may result from hormonal, medication-related, and physiological changes. Treatment options include dietary fiber, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol-based laxatives. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Elective endoscopic procedures should be deferred until the postpartum period, whereas nonemergent but necessary procedures should ideally be performed in the second trimester. Pregnant patients with cirrhosis should undergo evaluation for, and treatment of, esophageal varices; upper endoscopy is suggested in the second trimester (if not performed within 1 year before conception) to guide consideration of nonselective β-blocker therapy or endoscopic variceal ligation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, clinical remission before conception, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum period is essential for improving outcomes of pregnancy. Biologic agents should be continued throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period; use of methotrexate, thalidomide, and ozanimod must be stopped at least 6 months before conception. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography during pregnancy may be performed for urgent indications, such as choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and some cases of gallstone pancreatitis. Ideally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed during the second trimester, but if deferring the procedure may be detrimental to the health of the patient and fetus, a multidisciplinary team should be convened to decide on the advisability of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Cholecystectomy is safe during pregnancy; a laparoscopic approach is the standard of care regardless of trimester, but ideally in the second trimester. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is based on a serum bile acid level > 10 μmol/L in the setting of pruritus, typically during the second or third trimester. Treatment should be offered with oral ursodeoxycholic acid in a total daily dose of 10–15 mg/kg. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Management of liver diseases unique to pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy requires planning for delivery and timely evaluation for possible liver transplantation. Daily aspirin prophylaxis for patients at risk for pre-eclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome is advised beginning at week 12 of gestation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, serum hepatitis B virus DNA and liver biochemical test levels should be ordered. Patients not on treatment but with a serum hepatitis B virus DNA level > 200,000 IU/mL during the third trimester of pregnancy should be considered for treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients on immunosuppressive therapy for chronic liver diseases or after liver transplantation, therapy should be continued at the lowest effective dose during pregnancy. Mycophenolate mofetil should not be administered during pregnancy.

### Nonfetal imaging during pregnancy: acute abdomen / pelvis [^114jZ7i6]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common occurrence in pregnant women and may have a variety of causes, including those that are specific to pregnancy (eg, round ligament pain in the first trimester) and the wide range of causes of abdominal pain that affect men and women who are not pregnant (eg, appendicitis, acute cholecystitis). Noncontrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is increasingly performed to evaluate pregnant women with abdominal pain, either as the first-line test or as a second test following ultrasonography. The imaging appearance of causes of abdominal pain in pregnant women are reviewed with an emphasis on noncontrast MR imaging.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: case of a mistaken acute abdomen-a case report [^116ac6HE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pregnancies have been reported in both high-income countries as well as low- and middle-income countries. They are frequently missed in routine antenatal care in resource-limited settings and delayed diagnosis is usually associated with poor fetal and maternal outcomes including death. This case report is among the first from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a post-conflict region.

Case Presentation

In this case study, we present a 25year-old primigravida patient referred to HEAL Africa hospital for management of an acute abdomen at 33-weeks gestation. Her chief complaint was severe abdominal pain associated with each fetal movement for a period of 1 week prior to admission. A diagnosis of peritonitis was made. Emergency laparotomy revealed a normal live 2kg baby with placental implantation on the greater omentum and small intestine mesentery. The placenta was not removed. Both maternal and fetal outcomes were good.

Conclusion

Abdominal pregnancy with a normal live fetus at such an advanced gestational age is rare. This case reminds clinicians that abdominal pregnancy remains a differential diagnosis for painful fetal movements.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: case of a mistaken acute abdomen-a case report [^112oVpey]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Our patient presented with severe abdominal pain during fetal movements. The fetal presentation was not well defined on exam. Although easy palpation of fetal parts has been reported as a sign of abdominal pregnancy, this was not possible in the current case because the patient had a tense abdomen. Complaint of painful fetal movements noted in this case is consistent with findings noted in earlier case series. For instance, in a report by Bohiltea et al. painful fetal movements were noted in 40% of abdominal pregnancies.

Making the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy is challenging. While in more developed settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic method of choice for abdominal pregnancy, particularly in the more advanced stages, in low- and middle-income countries, clinicians must rely on good clinical judgement, and where available, on ultrasound. When performed in the first trimester, ultrasound will show an empty uterus with a separate gestational sac, or with a mass separated from the uterus, adnexa, and ovaries. Suspicion of abdominal pregnancy is increased by the presence of symptoms like abdominal pain with a positive pregnancy test. In the second and third trimesters, ultrasound usually shows no uterine wall surrounding the fetus, fetal parts that are very close to the abdominal wall, abnormal lie and/or no amniotic fluid between the placenta and the fetus. Unfortunately, ultrasound may not be as helpful at more advanced gestational ages like in the current case, where neither clinical assessment nor ultrasound made the diagnosis. It is also noted that transvaginal ultrasound in the first trimester of pregnancy may improve the diagnosis of extrauterine pregnancy. Importantly, in patients with previous major uterine surgery, differential diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy must include a uterine rupture with extrusion of the products of conception into the peritoneal cavity. Our patient had not had an ultrasound in either the first or second trimesters. We therefore propose that in resource-limited settings, where ultrasound is not always available, painful fetal movements may be an important sign of abdominal pregnancy and should raise the index of suspicion for health care providers.

Rh seroconversion and indications for anti-D immunoglobulin — The policy asks, "Is the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin indicated among Rh-negative women during the first trimester of pregnancy with threatened abortion, complete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or minor abdominal trauma?" and notes that data are limited, the conclusion is based on a rational theoretical construct and limited observational studies rather than on prospective or experimental studies, and that the strength of that conclusion varies somewhat with the individual entity being considered.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: case of a mistaken acute abdomen-a case report [^114r8Xj3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pregnancies may progress uneventfully to an advanced stage, particularly in resource-limited countries but they rarely reach term. Possible factors believed to contribute to fetal survival include the site of implantation and availability of adequate vascular supply. We presume that restricted blood supply and oxygenation results in poor weight gain and fetal demise before birth. Furthermore, congenital malformations, which appear to be more common in abdominal pregnancies, also contribute to fetal demise. In our case, the pregnancy progressed to 33 weeks, likely because implantation occurred on the well-vascularized omentum and small bowel mesentery, resulting in an adequate birth weight of 2 kgs at 33 weeks. In recent years, a few case reports have described abdominal pregnancies with implantation on the liver, spleen and kidney but these abdominal pregnancies were diagnosed and terminated in the first trimester. However, several other existing case reports describe delivery of a normal live fetus in different African countries such as Ghana, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.

The diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy may be a surprise finding in the operating theatre, as was the case with our patient. For instance, some abdominal pregnancies are diagnosed at the time of emergency caesarean section for failed labor induction and during elective caesarean section. This is more common in low resource settings where access to imaging such MRI, and in some contexts ultrasound, is not possible. Other abdominal pregnancies are diagnosed during exploratory laparotomy as occurred in the current case.

Abdominal pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial. Consensus on the best management of abdominal pregnancy is lacking. A conservative approach with delayed surgery is suggested when patients present after a gestational age of 24 weeks with a live fetus. In these cases, timing of delivery should be decided in consultation with the mother once the fetus has reached a viable age, because perinatal death may result from either prematurity or prolonged gestation in a compromised environment.

Intrauterine device (IUD) strings not visible and cannot be safely retrieved — ultrasonography and pregnancy management: If ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD and if the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall; if ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the patient to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever; removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal and risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place; theoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD, however whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown; a systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and with LNG-IUDs when the IUDs were not removed, eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions, with Cu-IUD removal decreasing risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD.

### Menstrual cramps in anovulatory versus normally ovulatory cycles-SARS-COV-2 pandemic daily data plus a meta-analysis of cramps and anovulation [^115VSQCv]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis of Primary Dysmenorrhea/Menstrual Cramps

Currently, overproduction of prostaglandins by the myometrium and endometrium is the explanation for primary dysmenorrhea for which there is the most evidence. Cells released during endometrial sloughing produce prostaglandin F 2α and prostaglandin E 2. These prostaglandins cause myometrial hypercontractility resulting in ischemia of the uterine muscle, as well as increased sensitivity of nociceptive nerve endings, respectively.

Prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid, a process that is controlled by cyclic adenosine phosphate. Prostaglandin production is increased through cyclic adenosine phosphate stimulation by a myriad of signals which include tissue trauma and mechanical stimuli as well as the ovarian hormones (such as estradiol and progesterone), epinephrine and peptide hormones. Arachidonic acid is a derivative of phospholipids released by phospholipase A2, an enzyme found in lysosomes. Lysosomal activity is adjusted by multiple factors; increased progesterone levels stabilize lysosomal activity, but decreasing progesterone removes that stabilizing effect, releasing lysosomal enzymes. During the late luteal phase, the corpus luteum regresses alongside a decrease in progesterone and estradiol levels. This decrease results in the release of phospholipase A2 from lysosomes in the endometrium ultimately raising arachidonic acid (the limiting factor for prostaglandin synthesis) by hydrolyzing phospholipids in the cell membrane. Increased arachidonic acid in conjunction with tissue trauma and intracellular sloughing during menstruation results in an overproduction of prostaglandins during menstruation.

A prospective study conducted by Wilson and Kurzrok (1938)first asserted that menstrual cramps occur only in ovulatory cycles. The data were based on 20 tracings from three women who had ovulatory bleeding, 14 tracings in one woman who had anovulatory bleeding and 38 tracings from 14 women with dysmenorrhea.

We have always noted [dysmenorrhea's] association with an ovulatory cycle as shown by the presence of a secretory endometrium… we now believe the presence of functional dysmenorrhea indicates the occurrence of ovulation. (page 84)

This was repeated by Dawood (1981)"The only proven endocrine factor is the occurrence of primary dysmenorrhea in ovulatory cycles". (page 45). However, since those important publications, there have been few studies to investigate and support that widely accepted hypothesis. Thus, there is a need to gather data and examine the role of progesterone and normal ovulation in the pathophysiology of primary menstrual cramps.
