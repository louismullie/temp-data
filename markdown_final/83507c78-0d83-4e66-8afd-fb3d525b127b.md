## Question

Low t4 and normal TSH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage the discordant thyroid function test pattern of low free T4 with a normal TSH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology and why this pattern is inappropriate for a primary thyroid disorder. Then, I should verify whether acute illness, assay interference, or medications could explain the results. Next, I will consider central hypothyroidism and outline the workup. After that, I need to think about rarer entities that can mimic this pattern. Finally, I will synthesize a management plan and note special population nuances, ensuring I double-check monitoring principles and reference intervals throughout.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic premise so I do not jump to conclusions: in intact hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid feedback, a fall in circulating FT4 should trigger a compensatory rise in TSH, so a low FT4 with normal TSH is an "inappropriately normal" TSH and is discordant for primary hypothyroidism, steering me to central axis pathology, analytical interference, or non-thyroidal illness as leading explanations [^115BDX3H] [^117NV6Ub] [^117AhYKn].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical context before labeling this as endocrine disease because acute or critical illness commonly produces low T3, low or low-normal T4, and normal or low-normal TSH (non-thyroidal illness syndrome), which is usually self-limited and should not be treated with levothyroxine; instead, treat the underlying illness and retest after recovery, with rT3 testing rarely adding value in routine practice [^117AhYKn] [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine the possibility of analytical interference or method issues, because I need to ensure I am not making decisions on spurious data; high-dose biotin classically causes falsely high FT4 and low TSH rather than low FT4, but wait, let me verify the broader point that intermethod bias for FT4 and TSH can reach up to 50%, meaning a repeat on an alternate platform, use of method-specific reference intervals, or referral to a specialist lab can resolve discordance due to assay artifacts [^115jXbXK] [^1154V4yy] [^111qDnSc] [^112jhSYv].

> I should now review medications that suppress hypothalamic or pituitary drive, because this could explain a low FT4 with an inappropriately normal TSH; dopamine or dopamine agonists, high-dose glucocorticoids, somatostatin analogues, bexarotene, and mitotane can all lower TSH, with mitotane particularly linked to a central hypothyroid pattern with low FT4 and blunted TRH responses, so I need to check the medication list carefully and decide whether cessation is feasible or whether to treat as central hypothyroidism if the drug must continue [^117Vkavm] [^116h7fEm] [^116uLLpr].

> If acute illness, assay issues, and drugs do not account for the pattern, I should evaluate for central hypothyroidism; the 2018 European Thyroid Association guidance emphasizes that low FT4 with a normal or low TSH that is inappropriately low for the degree of hypothyroxinemia warrants a pituitary-focused workup, including assessment of the adrenal, gonadal, GH, and prolactin axes and pituitary MRI, while remembering that post–traumatic brain injury hypopituitarism can emerge later and that CeH presentations may be subtle [^117NV6Ub] [^115BDX3H] [^1145Vhf8].

> But wait, what if the biochemical picture reflects rarer physiology rather than CeH; I initially wondered about resistance to thyroid hormone beta, yet I should correct myself because RTHβ typically presents with elevated FT4 and FT3 with nonsuppressed TSH, not low FT4, whereas entities that raise the T3/T4 ratio such as mild dyshormonogenesis, RTHα, or MCT8 deficiency can show low-normal FT4 with relatively higher FT3 and a normal TSH, so I need to consider the FT3 level and T3/T4 ratio and the clinical phenotype before pursuing genetic testing, keeping in mind that true low FT4 with normal TSH from these is uncommon in adults and often syndromic [^11385f4o] [^115jXbXK] [^1151wBvN] [^111REMBW].

> I should now synthesize interpretation and management while double-checking monitoring principles; when central hypothyroidism is confirmed, treat with levothyroxine and monitor to a target FT4 in the upper half of the reference interval because TSH cannot be used to titrate dose in CeH, whereas in non-thyroidal illness I should avoid thyroid hormone therapy and reassess after recovery, and if results were confounded by assay artifact I must rely on the corrected measurements before acting; if medications are causal and cannot be stopped, treat as CeH and titrate by FT4 and symptoms, noting that the prevalence of true CeH is low compared with the frequency of low FT4 findings in the community [^117NV6Ub] [^115BDX3H] [^116gv3zG] [^117AhYKn] [^115woo8n] [^112jhSYv] [^116h7fEm] [^1151bGme].

> Let me consider special populations because I need to ensure diagnostic thresholds and urgency are appropriate; in older adults, age-specific TSH ranges and strategies that include first-line FT4 can reduce overdiagnosis and improve efficiency, whereas in pregnancy, population- and trimester-specific reference intervals for both TSH and FT4 are critical to avoid misclassification and delayed treatment of overt hypothyroidism, and in children, TSH-based newborn screening can miss CeH so low FT4 with normal TSH warrants prompt pediatric endocrine evaluation and treatment to protect neurodevelopment [^113bqae9] [^113skzpS] [^113jZXuL] [^113gSBLf] [^116PV6eR] [^114PQuog].

> I should double-check the stepwise algorithm to avoid missteps; start with clinical context to differentiate NTIS from outpatient scenarios, review drugs, exclude assay interference by retesting on a different platform or in a reference lab, then pursue a central hypothyroidism workup with a full pituitary panel and MRI if discordance persists, and manage accordingly while monitoring by FT4 rather than TSH in CeH, recognizing that although low FT4 flags many patients, CeH itself remains rare relative to assay and illness-related explanations [^117AhYKn] [^112jhSYv] [^117NV6Ub] [^1151bGme].

Low free T4 with normal TSH most often reflects **central hypothyroidism** (pituitary or hypothalamic disease) [^117NV6Ub] or **non-thyroidal illness syndrome** (NTIS) [^117AhYKn]. Less common causes include **assay interference** [^115jXbXK] [^112jhSYv], medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, dopamine, somatostatin analogs) [^117Vkavm], or rare genetic defects [^111REMBW]. Evaluation should include repeat TSH/FT4, FT3, pituitary hormones, and MRI [^115D3Sp4], with consideration of assay interference [^115jXbXK]; treat central hypothyroidism with **levothyroxine** [^117NV6Ub] and manage NTIS by treating the underlying illness [^117AhYKn].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

### Central hypothyroidism

By definition, **central hypothyroidism** is characterized by insufficient TSH secretion from the pituitary or hypothalamus, leading to low FT4 with normal or mildly low TSH [^117NV6Ub]. The **pathophysiology** is inadequate pituitary or hypothalamic TSH production, resulting in reduced thyroid hormone production despite normal or mildly low TSH levels [^115BDX3H].

---

### Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)

By definition, **non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)**, also known as euthyroid sick syndrome [^116uLLpr], occurs in critically ill patients and is characterized by low FT4, low T3, and normal or slightly decreased TSH [^117AhYKn]. The **pathophysiology** involves acute illness suppressing hypothalamic TRH, reducing TSH secretion and thyroid hormone production, which leads to low FT4 with normal or slightly decreased TSH [^117AhYKn].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with low FT4 and normal TSH

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Central hypothyroidism | Insufficient TSH secretion from pituitary or hypothalamus | Pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction [^117NV6Ub] |
| Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) | Thyroid hormone abnormalities due to acute illness | Suppression of hypothalamic TRH [^117AhYKn] |
| Assay interference | Laboratory artifacts causing false low FT4 | Analytical interference [^115jXbXK] |
| Medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, dopamine, somatostatin analogs) | Drugs suppressing TSH secretion | Pharmacological suppression [^117Vkavm] |
| Genetic defects (e.g. thyroglobulin gene mutations) | Rare genetic disorders affecting thyroid hormone synthesis | Genetic mutations [^1151wBvN] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

Begin with **repeat testing** to confirm low FT4 with normal TSH and to exclude laboratory error [^111Wrp1V], and perform a **clinical assessment** for symptoms of hypothyroidism, pituitary dysfunction, or acute illness [^1151bGme].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **Free T3 measurement** — Assess FT3 levels to differentiate between central hypothyroidism and NTIS [^115woo8n].

- **Pituitary hormone evaluation** — Measure other pituitary hormones (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, LH, FSH, GH) to identify multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies [^115D3Sp4].

- **Assay interference** — Consider analytical interference, especially if clinical findings do not match laboratory results [^115jXbXK].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain a **pituitary MRI** to identify pituitary or hypothalamic lesions in suspected central hypothyroidism [^115D3Sp4].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Central hypothyroidism

Clinical implications include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and other **hypothyroid symptoms**; management involves **levothyroxine replacement therapy**, with monitoring of FT4 levels to guide dosage adjustments [^117Uf2Sh].

---

### Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)

In **non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)**, the **clinical implications** relate to acute illness severity and prognosis; **management** focuses on treating the underlying illness, and thyroid hormone replacement is generally not recommended unless persistent hypothyroidism is confirmed [^117AhYKn].

---

### Assay interference and medications

For assay interference and medication effects, the **clinical implications** are that falsely low FT4 can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment; **management** involves identifying and addressing the underlying cause and avoiding unnecessary thyroid hormone replacement [^115jXbXK] [^117Vkavm].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

- **Central hypothyroidism** — Prognosis depends on underlying pituitary or hypothalamic disease; lifelong hormone replacement may be required [^115BDX3H].

- **NTIS** — Prognosis depends on severity of underlying illness; thyroid hormone abnormalities typically resolve with recovery [^117AhYKn].

- **Assay interference**: Prognosis is excellent once interference is identified and corrected [^112jhSYv].

---

Low FT4 with normal TSH is most commonly due to **central hypothyroidism** or **NTIS** [^117NV6Ub], with less common causes including assay interference, medications, and genetic defects. A **structured diagnostic approach** — including repeat testing, clinical assessment, laboratory investigations, and imaging — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^111Wrp1V].

- **Methods to detect analytical interference in assays or diagnose entities**: The ability to detect assay interference and estimate the true concentration of circulating thyroid hormones (THs) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) depends on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, while others are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory.

	- Interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context can be very helpful, particularly when there is discordance between thyroid function tests (TFTs) and the patient's clinical status, or if there is an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference. Unfortunately, more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention.

	- In some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

### Thyroid function in critically ill patients [^117AhYKn]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) typically present with decreased concentrations of plasma tri-iodothyronine, low thyroxine, and normal range or slightly decreased concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone. This ensemble of changes is collectively known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). The extent of NTIS is associated with prognosis, but no proof exists for causality of this association. Initially, NTIS is a consequence of the acute phase response to systemic illness and macronutrient restriction, which might be beneficial. The pathogenesis of NTIS in long-term critical illness is more complex and includes suppression of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone, accounting for persistently reduced secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone despite low plasma thyroid hormone.

In some cases, distinguishing between NTIS and severe hypothyroidism, which is a rare primary cause for admission to the ICU, can be difficult. Infusion of hypothalamic-releasing factors can reactivate the thyroid axis in patients with NTIS, inducing an anabolic response. Whether this approach has a clinical benefit in terms of outcome is unknown.

In this series paper, we discuss diagnostic aspects, pathogenesis, and implications of NTIS as well as its distinction from severe, primary thyroid disorders in patients in the ICU.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^117NV6Ub]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting CeH in patients with low serum concentrations of free T4 and slightly elevated TSH (< 10 mU/L), or inappropriately lower than expected based on the hypothyroid state.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113jZXuL]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

It should also be noted that chronic disease, frequent in older adults, could be associated with non-thyroidal illness (NTI) and in severe cases may result in decreased fT4, thus generating false positives. Yet, TSH elevations are often found in the recovery phase after NTI mimicking SCHT.

Alternatively, the positive predictive value (PPV) of screening for thyroid dysfunction could be improved by elevation of the TSH cutoff value. Several other authors have proposed this approach. However, with this strategy (model 2), individuals with hypothyroidism and a limited elevation of TSH would be missed. Furthermore, in our population, the increase in PPV was only limited compared with the fT4-based strategy.

Some limitations have to be acknowledged. Firstly, due to the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot exclude that individuals included in the study may have had a history of thyroid disease, which we could not filter from the available laboratory data, for example in cases where patients have visited other laboratories for checkups. Second, the study group was relatively small. Further prospective studies with sufficient power are needed to validate our findings. Third, the determination of optimal cutoff values for TSH and fT4 (which currently vary significantly within geographical areas and within method groups) should also be investigated in follow-up studies. Yet, this is hampered by the fact that a gold standard test for hypothyroidism is lacking; the combination of test results from two tests, fT4 and TSH, determines the diagnosis.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^114PQuog]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Monitoring of dose and follow-up**: Serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations should be determined at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration (1|⊕⊕○). TSH concentration should be maintained in the age-specific reference range; TT4 or FT4 concentration should be maintained in the upper half of the age-specific reference range (1|⊕⊕○). Any reduction of L-T4 dose should not be based on a single increase in FT4 concentration during treatment (1|⊕⊕○).

	- The first follow-up examination should take place 1–2 weeks after the start of L-T4 treatment (1|⊕○○). Subsequent evaluation should take place every 2 weeks until a complete normalization of TSH concentration is reached; then every 1 to 3 months thereafter until the age of 12 months (1|⊕○○). Between the ages of one and three years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations (every 2 to 4 months) (1|⊕○○). Thereafter, evaluations should be carried out every 3 to 12 months until growth is completed (1|⊕○○). More frequent evaluations should be carried out if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained (1|⊕○○). Additional evaluations should be carried out 4–6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or formulation (1|⊕○○).

	- Adequate treatment throughout childhood is essential and overtreatment should be avoided (1|⊕⊕⊕).

### Whole-genome sequence-based analysis of thyroid function [^1144SRbu]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

Normal thyroid function is essential for health, but its genetic architecture remains poorly understood. For heritable thyroid traits such as thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), we analyze whole-genome sequence data from the UK10K project (N = 2,287). Using additional whole-genome sequence and deeply imputed datasets, we report meta-analysis results for common variants (MAF ≥ 1%) associated with TSH and FT4 (N = 16,335).

- **Thyrotropin (TSH)**: We identify a novel variant in SYN2 (MAF = 23.5%, P = 6.15 × 10⁻⁹) and a new independent variant in PDE8B (MAF = 10.4%, P = 5.94 × 10⁻¹⁴).

- **Free thyroxine (FT4)**: We report a low-frequency variant near B4GALT6/SLC25A52 (MAF = 3.2%, P = 1.27 × 10⁻⁹) tagging a rare TTR variant (MAF = 0.4%, P = 2.14 × 10⁻¹¹). All common variants explain ≥ 20% of the variance in TSH and FT4.

- **Rare variants analysis**: Using sequence kernel association testing, a novel association with FT4 in NRG1 is revealed.

Our results demonstrate that increased coverage in whole-genome sequence association studies identifies novel variants associated with thyroid function.

### Normal limits for serum thyrotropin vary greatly depending on method [^112G78x2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within populations do not follow a Gaussian distribution, and normal limits are derived after mathematical normalization. The clinical relevance of these limits is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare upper and lower TSH limits by four data normalization methods with non-normalized data and assess their clinical relevance.

- **Design, patients, and measurements**: Results of blood samples taken by community physicians and stored in a computerized database were analyzed after removing samples from patients with evidence of thyroid illness. TSH values were normalized by the Hoffmann and Tukey methods, with each method incorporating natural log transformation. Non-normalized data for TSH in the uppermost and lowermost percentiles were also calculated. Clinical relevance was determined by alterations in thyroid hormone levels at, below, and above the limits for each method.

- **Results**: The maximal reduction from non-normalized data for the upper normal limit (UNL) was by the Hoffman method (43% = 3.1 mIU/l). The maximal increase for the lower normal limit (LNL) was also by the Hoffman method (708% = 0.81 mIU/l). There was very limited difference in average FT3 and FT4 between patients with TSH within, below, or above the normal range for all methods.

- **Conclusions**: Different normalization methods alter the normal limits greatly. However, in individuals without thyroid illness, thyroid hormone values are stable over a wide range of TSH levels, including beyond the UNL for all methods. Indeed, there may be no true universal upper TSH cut-off.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112Cg569]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically with levothyroxine therapy (including indications and normal TSH levels), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of L-thyroxine in female patients of childbearing age who are planning a pregnancy in the immediate future (including via assisted reproduction). Additionally, it is recommended for pregnant patients with normal serum TSH levels, particularly in the presence or past positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies, and especially for those with a history of miscarriage or prior hypothyroidism.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115jXbXK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels.

- **Analytical interference**: Different types of analytical interference, such as abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, and biotin, can impact results. Disorders such as resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, and TSH-secreting pituitary tumor can also cause this biochemical pattern.

We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifacts, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis. This approach can potentially prevent unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

### Different causes of reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone: diagnosis and clinical management [^111REMBW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Normal thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism and action require adequate cellular TH signaling. This involves the proper function of TH transporters in the plasma membrane, intracellular deiodination of TH, and the action of the bioactive hormone T3 at its nuclear receptors (TRs). This review summarizes discoveries related to different syndromes with reduced sensitivity at the cellular level.

Mutations in the TH transporter MCT8 cause psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid parameters. Mutations in the SBP2 protein, necessary for normal deiodination, result in a multisystem disorder that includes abnormal thyroid function tests. Mutations in TRβ1 are a well-known cause of resistance to TH, usually presenting with a mild phenotype. Recently, patients with mutations in TRα1 have been identified, exhibiting slightly abnormal TH levels, growth retardation, and cognitive defects.

The review describes the mechanisms of disease, clinical phenotype, diagnostic testing, and suggestions for treatment strategies for each of these syndromes.

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

This study aims to review the physiological changes in thyroid function with aging and emphasize the importance of careful test interpretation in the elderly population. A literature review was conducted for this purpose.

- **Results**: Using age-specific reference ranges for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is recommended to minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH levels with normal thyroid hormone levels may improve over time, thus necessitating careful monitoring of thyroid function. It is advised that overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical judgment is essential in determining how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

The following abbreviations were used: FT4 = free thyroxine; rT3 = reverse triiodothyronine; T3 = triiodothyronine; T4 = thyroxine; TFT = thyroid function test; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarized. Although subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects, and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^117N3s5r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Accurately diagnosing thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy remains challenging. While the calculation of population- and pregnancy-specific TSH and FT4 reference intervals is considered the optimal approach, this is often not feasible. Our study highlights the suboptimal sensitivity and the false discovery rate (FDR) that common alternative approaches, such as using a fixed TSH upper limit of 4.0 mU/L or subtracting 0.5 mU/L from the TSH upper limit, have to detect specific thyroid function test abnormalities. Moreover, it is clear from these data that maximizing sensitivity often comes at the cost of a higher FDR, which constitutes a difficult tradeoff. We also identify that the use of nonpregnancy FT4 reference intervals was a primary contributor to diagnostic inaccuracy, especially in the detection of overt hypothyroidism — a condition where prompt management is warranted to mitigate adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

These data provide insights into the extent by which diagnostic accuracy of gestational thyroid function test abnormalities can be influenced by different strategies for defining TSH and/or FT4 cut-offs. This information can be used to weigh the pros and cons of future policy recommendations. An important result from this study is the poor diagnostic accuracy and high FDR with the use of alternative approaches to identify thyroid function test abnormalities with a treatment indication in the first and second trimester. Two main concepts about the use of alternative approaches arise from these data: (1) The large percentage of overdiagnosis (FDR) in general.

### Lack of association between serum TSH or free T4 and body mass index in euthyroid subjects [^114SyK6k]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

There is ongoing debate regarding the influence of minor changes in thyroid status within the normal range and body mass index (BMI). Overt thyroid dysfunction is well recognized to affect weight, but the influence of minor perturbations of thyroid function remains unclear.

- **Aim of the study**: To examine in euthyroid subjects the association of serum concentrations of TSH and free T4 within the normal range and BMI, and to compare serum TSH and free T4 concentrations in nonobese and obese subjects.

- **Subjects and methods**: A cohort of 401 euthyroid subjects with normal serum TSH (361 females, 40 males, mean age 48.2 years) who had been referred to a thyroid clinic due to the presence of a thyroid nodule or goitre. Measurements of serum TSH and free T4 were recorded, together with BMI (calculated from weight and height). Associations between measures of TSH, free T4, and BMI were investigated.

- **Results**: There was no association between either serum TSH or free T4 concentration, when considered as a continuous variable, and BMI, and no difference in BMI when subjects were categorized according to serum TSH or free T4. There was also no difference in serum TSH or free T4 between lean and obese euthyroid subjects. Evidence of thyroid autoimmunity indicated by the presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase was likewise not associated with a difference in BMI.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides no evidence for an association between thyroid status within the normal range and BMI.

### Central hypothyroidism - a neglected thyroid disorder [^115BDX3H]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by a defect in thyroid hormone secretion in an otherwise normal thyroid gland, due to insufficient stimulation by TSH. The disease results from the abnormal function of the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, or both. Furthermore, central hypothyroidism can be isolated or combined with other pituitary hormone deficiencies, which are mostly acquired and rarely congenital. The clinical manifestations of central hypothyroidism are usually milder than those observed in primary hypothyroidism.

Obtaining a positive diagnosis for central hypothyroidism can be challenging from both clinical and biochemical perspectives. Diagnosis is based on low circulating levels of free T4 in the presence of low to normal TSH concentrations. The correct diagnosis of both acquired (also termed sporadic) and congenital (also termed genetic) central hypothyroidism can be hindered by methodological interference in free T4 or TSH measurements; routine utilization of total T4 or T3 measurements; systemic illness characterized by low levels of free T4 and normal TSH concentrations; the use of the sole TSH-reflex strategy, which measures only the level of TSH without free T4 if TSH levels are in the normal range; and the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism based on TSH analysis without the concomitant measurement of serum levels of T4.

In this review, we discuss knowledge of the causes of central hypothyroidism, emphasizing possible pitfalls.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115woo8n]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Reverse T3 measurements

Unlike the active T4 metabolite T3, rT3 is an inactive metabolite of T4 as it does not bind or compete with T3 at the T3 receptor. Measurement of rT3 is widely cited in the lay press as a potential marker to guide T4 or T3 therapy; however, there is currently no evidence to support this application. Serum rT3 typically rises as T3 falls during nonthyroidal illness; consequently, measurement of rT3 adds little to this diagnosis unless nonthyroidal illness is confounding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.

However, as rT3 assays are not widely available, measurement of T3 is more practical, cheaper, and as effective as measuring rT3 if nonthyroidal illness syndrome is suspected. Other uses of rT3 analysis and the calculation of the serum rT3/T3 ratio are confined to the diagnosis of rare genetic thyroid conditions and the diagnosis of the rare consumptive hypothyroidism syndrome due to the overexpression of deiodinase enzyme 3. Except for these three uncommon situations, there is no need to measure rT3 in routine clinical practice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: Controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined by normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The TSH value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter.

Individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed, and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g. heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Mitotane treatment in patients with adrenocortical cancer causes central hypothyroidism [^116h7fEm]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Mitotane, a steroidogenesis inhibitor with adrenolytic properties used to treat adrenocortical cancer (ACC), can affect thyroid function. A reduction of FT4 levels with normal FT3 and TSH has been described in these patients. Using an in vitro murine model, the secretory capacity of thyrotrophic cells has been shown to be inhibited by mitotane.

- **Objective**: To investigate the pathogenesis of thyroid abnormalities in mitotane-treated patients with ACC.

- **Patients and methods**: In five female patients with ACC (median age 47; range 31–65) treated with mitotane (dosage 1.5 g/day; 1.0–3.0), we analyzed the pattern of TSH and thyroid function index (FT4, FT3, and FT3/FT4 ratio) compared to an age- and gender-matched control group. The in vivo secretory activity of the thyrotrophic cells was evaluated using a standard TRH test (200 μg), and the response was compared to both a group of age-matched female controls (n = 10) and central hypothyroid patients (n = 10).

- **Results**: Basal TSH (median 1.54 mU/l; range 1.20–2.17) was normal and scattered around our median reference value. FT3 levels (median 3.80 pmol/l; 3.30–4.29) were normal but below the median reference value of 4.37 pmol/l, and FT4 levels were below the normal range in all patients (median 8.40 pmol/l; 7.6–9.9). The FT3/FT4 ratio was in the upper range in four patients and higher than normal in one patient. A blunted TSH response to TRH was observed in mitotane-treated patients. ΔTSH (absolute TSH response, peak TSH minus basal TSH) was 3.65 (range 3.53–5.26), 12.37 (range 7.55–19.97), and 1.32 mU/l (range 0.52–4.66).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113skzpS]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 rather than thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) enhances efficiency in older adults in primary care. Adjusting the screening strategy can reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up visits, and patient concerns. An alternative approach is to elevate the TSH cutoff value, which also improves the positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosing clinical hypothyroidism.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). High credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empirical evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines and research.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: Scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range, while levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) remain within the reference range, are commonly observed in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of intervention have not been clearly established.

- **Objectives**: To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment, assess the consequences of non-treatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results was extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, which consists of tables and summaries for each subject area.

- **Data synthesis**: The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes is evaluated.

### Low serum free thyroxine level in a girl with McCune-Albright syndrome [^116jrX4g]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old girl with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) was suspected of having central hypothyroidism based on an inappropriately normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low free thyroxine (fT4) levels. She was clinically euthyroid, and her pituitary appeared normal on MRI. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine resulted in suppression of TSH, with a low fT4 and high free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentration, hence iatrogenic hyperthyroidism was diagnosed. After discontinuation of levothyroxine, the TSH and fT3 normalized, while fT4 remained low. Increased conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) can be part of MAS. Therefore, fT3 and fT4 should both be measured when evaluating thyroid function in patients with MAS.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction due to the lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when it is clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine.

We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians address daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease and will benefit from its treatment.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluations with few, if any, clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with a normal serum FT4 concentration. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Although these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established.

Most individuals found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established. Treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through five case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine.

Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on the management of subclinical disease.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111Wrp1V]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The clinical utility of serum TSH measurement is notable as it is one of the most frequently assessed analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and, in most cases, can be easily diagnosed using TSH measurement. The availability of high-quality, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Due to the log-linear relationship of TSH to free T4 (fT4), deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals are the preferred initial test for evaluating thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and interpreting TSH results is essential for practicing high-quality cost-effective medicine. TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, the turnaround time from specimen collection to patient follow-up is a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement can vary significantly. Patient age is an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns less than 3 days old are challenging to interpret due to the postnatal TSH surge.

- **Recommendations**:

	- The monitoring of L-T4 treatment should be based on periodic measurements of serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations. Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration (1|⊕⊕○). We recommend maintaining TSH in the age-specific reference range, but avoiding undetectable TSH levels below 0.05 mU/L, and ensuring serum concentrations of TT4 or FT4 are in the upper half of the age-specific reference range (1|⊕⊕○). If necessary, treatment should be adjusted according to the hormone concentrations measured, but decreases in L-T4 dose should not be based on a single high FT4 concentration during treatment (1|⊕⊕○). Clinicians should be familiar with the reference ranges used by the laboratory carrying out the tests (1|⊕○○).

	- We recommend performing the first follow-up examination 1 to 2 weeks after the start of L-T4 treatment, with intense follow-up over the first year of life. This involves evaluations every 2 weeks until TSH levels are completely normalized, and every 1 to 3 months thereafter until the age of 12 months. Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations every 2 to 4 months, with regular evaluations every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. Measurements should occur more frequently if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained, and 4 to 6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or formulation, such as a switch from brand to generic L-T4 (1|⊕○○).

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111T3dJh]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The quality assessment of analytical methods for TSH and TH remains a critical concern in the field. While studies from the C-STFT date back to 2017, information about the accuracy and quality of fT4 and TSH assays is very limited. Some data can be obtained from accuracy-based external quality assessment or proficiency testing programs. Additional insights can be derived from outpatient data, such as the Noklus Percentiler, or from anonymized electronic patient records. More research using different data sources is needed to monitor the accuracy of thyroid function tests.

A prerequisite for valid quality assessment is the commutability of the materials used. This means that the materials used for quality assessment should behave exactly as any patient sample in any given assay. Commercially available proficiency testing materials and quality control samples rarely replicate clinically relevant matrices and their variability. This has been demonstrated in a study for TSH reference materials, comparing TSH extracted from human pituitary tissue with recombinantly expressed (glycoengineered) TSH, both of which do not precisely match the sialylated TSH of hypothyroid patients.

Similarly, fT4 reference material matrices are distinct from those of the serum or plasma of patients with nonthyroidal illness, disturbed lipid metabolism, or renal disease. Differences in matrix composition may require normalization procedures, which will limit within- or between-comparability of test results.

The continuing use of non-SI units (e.g. ng/dL) in clinical practice instead of correct SI terminology (mol/L) frequently creates discrepancies in measurement standards and complicates the harmonization of test results across different laboratories. More standardized approaches and adherence to international measurement units are necessary for improving the reliability of thyroid function assessments.

### Different FT3/TSH correlation in acquired and congenital hypothyroid patients reveals a different hypothalamic set-point [^112gjToM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Several pieces of evidence indicate that maternal thyroid balance during pregnancy is important for the setup of the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis: excessive functioning of thyroid hormones during pregnancy may alter axis feedback, resulting in central hypothyroidism in infants. On the other hand, an increased TSH secretion is present in 43% of congenital hypothyroid (CH) infants and persists in 10% of late infants, suggesting hypothalamus–pituitary resistance in these subjects.

Studies evaluating the effect of either T4 or T3 on peripheral tissues did not find any difference between total peripheral (TP) and CH adult patients in terms of cholesterol, triglycerides, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Hence, it is reasonable to suppose that exposure to inappropriately low or high levels of thyroid hormones, before the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis maturation, may alter its set point, leading to either increased or decreased sensitivity to thyroid hormone feedback, respectively.

Although studies evaluating the correlation between FT4 and TSH in CH at different ages are numerous, studies evaluating FT3 and TSH are scanty. In this report, similar to a retrospective survey of the young Japanese population, we observed a lower FT3/FT4 ratio in CH than in euthyroid (EU) patients; nevertheless, we also found higher FT3 levels and FT3/FT4 ratios in CH than in TP patients. These data suggest that CH patients may have different regulation of biochemical thyroid parameters under replacement therapy than TP patients. Several in vivo studies suggest that the lower FT3/FT4 ratio in TP patients may be due to a "dissociation" of type two deiodinase (Dio2) activity.

### We all know we need them, we hope they are coming, but when [^111dptHL]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

A number of mechanisms modify thyroid hormone (TH) signaling at the cellular level. To restore TH signaling in patients with hypothyroidism or in patients with the syndrome of TH resistance, it is necessary to quantify the action of THs in a tissue-specific manner. The development of biomarkers that are tissue-specific and respond to TH is a significant first step toward understanding and possibly modifying TH signaling in health and disease states.

### Clinical review: The thyroid in mind: cognitive function and low thyrotropin in older people [^113xy1xT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a serum TSH concentration below the reference range, with normal free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3) levels. SH can be divided into two groups: patients with a mildly reduced TSH (0.1–0.4 mU/liter) are classified as having grade I SH, whereas those with a serum TSH of less than 0.1 mU/liter, including a completely suppressed TSH level (< 0.01 mU/liter), are classified as having grade II SH. Epidemiological studies report the prevalence of SH to range from 0.63 to 2.1%.

Most individuals with SH do not exhibit symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and it is relatively rare for them to develop specific complications attributable to SH, such as atrial fibrillation or osteoporosis. Many people with SH have only a transient thyroid function abnormality, with resolution of biochemical abnormalities found in 25–75% of those with grade I SH upon repeat testing. Consequently, the majority of individuals with grade I SH do not have intrinsic thyroid disease; their low TSH reflects nonthyroidal illness or drug effects.

However, approximately 1–2% of patients over the age of 60 with SH progress to overt hyperthyroidism. This progression is more likely in patients with grade II SH, reflecting the indolent nature of multinodular goiter as the dominant cause in this age group, with mild thyroid autonomy developing slowly. A small number of individuals with SH have early Graves' disease, and progression to overt hyperthyroidism is more probable in these cases. Conversely, 1–2% of elderly individuals have a persistently and stably low serum TSH.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^111yC7gv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

True biochemical hyperthyroidism with nonsuppressed TSH can present as genuinely raised (free) T4 levels.

Thyroxine therapy, especially with poor compliance, is a significant factor in this biochemical pattern. Variable compliance with T4 therapy in hypothyroidism can cause a scenario of normal or elevated FT4 and raised TSH concentrations. In such cases, an increase in thyroxine dosage to a potentially supraphysiological level can normalize TSH levels, but it may also lead to elevated circulating thyroid hormones (THs), suggesting the possibility of underlying resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ). Distinguishing this condition from true coincidence of RTHβ with autoimmune hypothyroidism, which is rare, requires further discussion.

A subset of hypothyroid patients, compliant with thyroxine therapy in physiological dosages, can exhibit raised circulating FT4 while maintaining normal FT3 and TSH concentrations. This phenomenon has been linked to reduced activity of type 2 deiodinase, which diminishes the conversion of T4 to T3, inhibiting pituitary TSH secretion.

Deficiency in selenocysteine-containing proteins, such as deiodinase enzymes, is another contributing factor. Over 25 human proteins, including thyroid deiodinase enzymes, incorporate the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). The incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins during their translation depends on a unique cellular pathway involving its specific transfer RNA (Sec-tRNA (Ser)Sec, encoded by TRU-TCA1–1) and a binding protein (SECIS binding protein 2, encoded by SECISBP2), which interacts with a specific sequence known as the Selenium Cysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS).

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^1154V4yy]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

- **Comparability and quality assessment of fT4 and TSH assays**: The results of hormone assays must be reliable given the high clinical impact on diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring of patients' health and disease. Thus, the guarantee of their specificity, accuracy, and precision requires external reference points, standardized and certified reference materials, and regular documented proficiency testing. Compliance of the methods used in each laboratory with the International Guideline ISO 17511:2020 on harmonization should be sought, as this will guarantee that the result for the patient samples is traceable to the SI units or the highest available standards.

- **Comparability of results: The need for standardization/harmonization**: Thyroid hormone laboratory results ideally should be comparable over time, location, and independent of the method used. In 2017, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Committee of Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests (IFCC C-STFT) documented the status of comparability of results for both fT4 and TSH assays from 13 of 15 assay manufacturers. Depending on the selected assay reagents and equipment, laboratory results may differ by up to 50% for both fT4 and TSH. If method-specific reference intervals are not employed, the classification of a numerical test result may be different depending on the assay used.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice among young and middle-aged individuals, as well as the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems.

The treatment and management of SCTD and population screening remain controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease. There is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk.

In this review, we critically examine the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also explore the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^113gSBLf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) in pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies. We sought to quantify the diagnostic consequences of these recommendations.

- **Methods**: We included cohorts participating in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Different approaches were used to define RIs: a TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L (fixed limit approach), a fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L (subtraction approach), and using nonpregnancy RIs. Outcome measures were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) of women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 52,496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with the use of trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches had low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) to detect women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR to detect a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar between the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approach (0.77–0.11 vs 0.74–0.16 vs 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance to detect overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism mainly varied between FT4 RI approaches, while the diagnostic performance to detect subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approach.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

After excluding confounding causes, such as measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities, or drug therapies as outlined above, genuinely raised circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic condition (RTHβ) or an acquired condition (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma). Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different, approximately 230 known, heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, as well as the magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations, do not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing for RTHβ and pituitary imaging for TSHoma should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ, and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically proven RTHβ cases.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^116uLLpr]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and to determine the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations, also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval. This allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and thyroid hormone measurement: Clinical algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

- **Clinical utility of TH measurements complementing interpretation of the primary parameter TSH**: TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations, such as pregnancy and illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome). It is also necessary during the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed following a change in thyroid status.

- **Common physiological and pharmacological effects**: While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis.

2.0 Criteria for diagnosis

- **Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration**:

	- **Recommendations**:

		We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal.

		When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis. If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment.

	- **Evidence**:

		L-T4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: An ignored clinical syndrome [^1145Vhf8]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Low credibility.

Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency is infrequent in the early stage and is difficult to recognize because of associated nonspecific features. Low T3 and T4 levels with normal TSH levels in the early stage can be due to the injury itself and can persist for 2–3 weeks. This low-T3-syndrome-like state cannot reliably identify secondary hypothyroidism due to pituitary dysfunction. TSH deficiency is less frequent, occurring in 4.1–6.2% of patients 12 months after injury.

In a long-term follow-up study of children with severe TBI, approximately 13% of patients exhibited pituitary dysfunction (10% growth hormone deficiency, 3% TSH deficiency, and 2% adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency) when followed for 1–7 years post-TBI. Experimental studies indicate that thyroid hormones play a role in reducing brain edema and stimulating neural regeneration.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as having an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) while free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels remain within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients; however, screening is advised for high-risk populations.

There is good evidence indicating that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, although evidence for other associations is lacking. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: When to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g. in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodine-deficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable TSH levels.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density with an increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear.

The possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with a TSH level…

### TSH and FT4 reference intervals in pregnancy: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^116PV6eR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

A notable observation from the results of the systematic review is the large variation in reference limits within the same assays, as can be observed in Figures 2–4. Furthermore, while no formal test for differences between reference intervals has been performed, it can be noted that the Beckman assay has relatively lower FT4 reference intervals than the other assays. This demonstrates the impact of preanalytical factors as well as determinants of thyroid function tests on the variation between populations and highlights the importance of locally derived reference intervals for TSH and FT4 in pregnancy.

Regarding iodine status, iodine deficiency is associated with a higher risk of thyroid dysfunction, and the inclusion of participants with iodine deficiency might lead to unreliable reference intervals. However, two recently published studies show no significant differences in reference limits when including mild to moderate iodine-insufficient participants (urinary iodine concentration: 50–149 μg/L), which calls for a more lenient recommendation regarding the iodine status of the reference population. On the other hand, chronic excessive iodine intake may lead to hypothyroidism, while a sudden increase in iodine intake may lead to transient hyperthyroidism. For instance, the Chilean population has a history of chronic high iodine intake following the iodine fortification program initiated in 1979, which resulted in a reduction of fortification in 2000. These fluctuations might explain the relatively high upper reference limits for TSH in the Chilean cohort in the IPD meta-analysis.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111qDnSc]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Alternatively, the state-of-the-art APS can be derived from the evaluation and comparison of laboratory methods or through peer comparison data from proficiency testing programs. In general, the TSH assays in clinical practice meet the desirable APS (based on biological variation) for imprecision; this may not be true for fT4 assays. Importantly, large intermethod biases are observed for both TSH and fT4, which prevents the adoption of universal reference intervals and medical decision limits for thyroid tests. Moreover, the relationship between TSH and fT4 varies depending on the specific assay method used.

- **Biological variability of TSH and TH concentrations**: The log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship illustrates both within- and between-subject biological variability in healthy individuals. This variability increases with both thyroid and nonthyroidal illnesses. Results from systematic studies in healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins, repetitive sampling studies, and the testing of individuals or (sub-)populations in different regions have shown markedly narrower within-subject variability (e.g. during monthly sampling) than between-subject variations. Such studies reveal that heritability accounts for 30% to 65% of the variance in TSH, fT4, fT3, and the fT4 × TSH product. Consequently, population-based reference intervals for thyroid test variables are much broader than the rather narrow within-subject variance and are less useful for monitoring an individual patient.

### Thyroid function, body mass index, and metabolic risk markers in euthyroid adults: a cohort study [^111JYPaj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

In the present study, a high concentration of fT3 and a low concentration of fT4 were associated with a high risk of overweight. Furthermore, a high concentration of TSH and fT3/fT4 were associated with a higher risk of obesity, implying that the differences in the HPT axis in obesity do not purely represent an exacerbation of the differences present in overweight. In the underweight group, the serum TSH concentration was similar to that of normal weight participants, but fT3 concentration and fT3/fT4 were lower, and fT4 was higher. In addition, patients in the first quartile of fT4 had a lower risk of being underweight than the other participants.

Leptin has been reported to be a key component of the complex physiologic regulation of the HPT axis, and serum leptin is associated with TSH concentration. In obesity, the leptin concentration increases, and it crosses the blood-brain barrier to regulate the endocrine system through actions in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Leptin signaling has also been shown to be required for the maintenance of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Several epidemiologic studies have found a positive relationship between serum TSH and leptin concentrations in humans. However, conversely, TSH receptors located on adipose cell membranes regulate adipocyte proliferation, which may partly explain the association between high TSH concentration and a higher risk of overweight or obesity. Greater secretion of TRH and TSH from the hypothalamus and pituitary leads to the secretion of more thyr.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JY1Hu]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

We believe this is the first systematic review studying TSH and thyroid hormone associations with various clinical parameters. The results indicate that, contrary to the paradigm, thyroid hormone levels are associated more strongly with clinical parameters than TSH levels. Any relationship of clinical parameters with TSH levels can be explained by the strong population relationship between thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, such that TSH levels are merely indirect measures of thyroid hormone levels.

In our sample, we found no indication of, or reference to, any work that suggested that TSH levels consistently indicate thyroid status of any organ or tissue more strongly than thyroid hormone levels.

As our goal was not to estimate the effect size for one treatment, our meta-analysis methodology differed from some other meta-analysis methodologies in that we did not use a weighted technique or pool all original patient data. In addition, it would not have been appropriate to combine all of these factors by using such meta-analysis methodology, as our analysis encompassed multiple studies covering various clinical outcomes, using different methodologies, different assays, and statistical methods.

Theoretically, one could use such other methodology to do a meta-analysis of each clinical parameter, but these individual meta-analyses would still need to be combined by using a method akin to ours (i.e. summing the meta-analyses in some way) to determine whether levels of thyroid hormones or TSH are more likely to be associated in general with clinical parameters.

### Is thyroid status associated with cognitive impairment in elderly patients in China [^1159KBBm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone measurement and evaluation of thyroid dysfunction

Fasting samples were collected from participants using standard precautions. Serum fT3, fT4, and TSH levels were measured via a chemiluminescent immunoassay performed on an automated assay system (ADVIA Centaur XP, Siemens, Germany). The interassay coefficients of variation (CV %) for fT3, fT4, and TSH were 3.0, 4.0, and 6.4 (level one), and 2.5, 6.0, and 7.1 (level three), respectively. All analyses were conducted using standardized laboratory procedures.

Thyroid dysfunction was assessed based on measurements of fT3, fT4, and TSH levels. According to our laboratory-verified reference ranges, normal serum TSH, fT3, and fT4 intervals were 0.55–4.78 mIU/l, 3.50–6.50 pmol/l, and 11.50–22.70 pmol/l, respectively. Cut-off levels for TSH were 4.78 mIU/l for hypothyroidism, while cut-off levels for fT4 and fT3 were 22.70 and > 6.50 pmol/l for hyperthyroidism. Based on hormone levels, patients were classified into four categories: subclinical hyperthyroidism (low serum TSH with normal fT3 and fT4 levels), euthyroidism (normal TSH, fT3, and fT4), subclinical hypothyroidism (high TSH with normal fT3 and fT4), and clinical hypothyroidism (high TSH combined with low fT3 and/or fT4 levels).

Neuropsychological assessment

All participants were given neuropsychological tests by a certified professional who was unaware of the cause or diagnosis. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery incorporating memory, language, attention, and executive functions was administered.

### Current utility of first-line FT4 and TSH in screening for central hypothyroidism [^1151bGme]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid testing strategies vary across laboratories. First-line combined thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (FT4) have historically been preferred by many laboratories, as this detects individuals with undiagnosed central hypothyroidism who can be missed with a first-line TSH-only strategy. However, an up-to-date evaluation of the utility of this approach is lacking.

- **Objectives**: We investigated the clinical utility of first-line TSH and FT4 in the detection of central hypothyroidism in day practice.

- **Design, patients, and measurements**: The All-Wales laboratory information system was queried to identify thyroid function tests in patients aged ≥ 16 years with decreased FT4 and inappropriate TSH (low-FT4). The 1-year incidence of low-FT4 was determined using mid-year population data. Clinical information of patients with low-FT4 was reviewed to determine causes of low-FT4 and the incidence of central hypothyroidism.

- **Results**: The incidence of low-FT4 varied according to the FT4 assay method (range: 98–301 cases/100,000 population/year). Fifteen new cases of central hypothyroidism were detected in two health boards, equivalent to 2 cases/100,000 population/year. The positive predictive value of low-FT4 for central hypothyroidism was 2%-4%. In a cross-section of primary care patients, low-FT4 was detected in 0.5% of all thyroid tests with assay-related differences in detection rates.

- **Conclusions**: Although low-FT4 is a common laboratory finding, the incidence of central hypothyroidism remains rare. With the currently increased rates of thyroid testing, further evaluation and context-specific guidelines may be necessary.

### The TSH upper reference limit: Where are we at [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered due to the inclusion of such individuals.

- **The opposite suggestion**: The TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women, and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals.

This review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the controversy surrounding the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex, and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this heterogeneous disorder. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in early neurodevelopment, so untreated severe CH results in neurological and psychiatric deficits, including intellectual disability, spasticity, and disturbances of gait and coordination. CH is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation.

Screening programs in most industrialized countries, operational over the last 30 years, have led to the successful early detection and treatment of infants with CH and have eliminated the severe neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from late diagnosis. Studies on cognitive function in patients with CH treated soon after birth have shown that normal development can be achieved in most patients, although some may have subtle neurocognitive deficits.

Estimates of the prevalence of CH vary according to the method of ascertainment: about 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in countries with neonatal screening versus about 1 in 6700 live births before the screening era. Recent reports indicate that the incidence of primary CH may be increasing in some countries, particularly for cases with a normally located (eutopic) thyroid gland and milder dysfunction. The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to changes in screening thresholds.

The results from neonatal screening programs have also helped to identify a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions with different underlying etiologies. CH can be classified according to site.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113g3Xto]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

At the time of writing and to the best of our knowledge, the information from individual studies showing the superiority of thyroid hormone levels in terms of associations with individual clinical parameters has not been synthesized into a formal conclusion regarding the biochemical assessment of thyroid function in general.

It has been suggested that, despite TSH being considered a more sensitive indicator of thyroid status, fT4 may be a more sensitive indicator of "cardiac" or "tissue" thyroid status. Our study strengthens and generalizes these propositions, indicating that fT4 is the more sensitive indicator of thyroid status because it better indicates tissue and organ effects.

The superior association of clinical parameters with fT4, as compared to TSH levels, has more often been attributed to a putative disturbance of set point physiology, to a significant difference between pituitary and peripheral sensitivity to fT4, or to statistical or other factors, including reverse causation.

Explanations related to set points are challenged by evidence that relatively stable thyroid hormone levels seen in individuals are better explained by a model of "balance points" (or "equilibrium points") rather than "set points". Nonetheless, it has been suggested that in older adults, there is an alteration of what is termed "set point physiology", in that TSH may be less suppressed by any given rise in fT4. However, in this situation, though the range of TSH may change, any physiological association with greater or lesser TSH remains uncertain.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine therapy, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating L-thyroxine in female patients of childbearing age who are planning a pregnancy in the immediate future (including assisted reproduction) and in pregnant patients with serum TSH levels greater than 2.5 mIU/L in the presence of or past positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Thyroid function testing is based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function. Thus, subclinical thyroid dysfunction, as currently defined, is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction, with a population prevalence of approximately 5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple. Its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accurate diagnostic criteria are needed.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^117Uf2Sh]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend monitoring free T4 and TSH during childhood at least every two years, and annually thereafter, in patients under follow-up for hypothalamic-pituitary disease. Central hypothyroidism should be suspected when serum free T4 falls in the lower quartile of the normal range, particularly when a free T4 decrease greater than 20% of previous values is observed. This is applicable provided that the variables are measured by the same assay, despite a low or normal TSH.

### Clinical review: Central hypothyroidism: Pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges [^115D3Sp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Central hypothyroidism is a condition that can be associated with a variety of symptoms and complications. These include diabetes insipidus, sweating, pituitary apoplexy, adrenal insufficiency, decreased serum free T4, weight gain, and traumatic brain injury. Additionally, hypothyroidism may be linked to low thyrotropin-releasing hormone levels, muscle cramps, hemochromatosis, and stroke. Further associations include radiation therapy to the head area, hypopituitarism, headaches, Sheehan's syndrome, pituitary tumors, decreased serum TSH, hypogonadism, fatigue, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), acromegaly, cold intolerance, decreased serum free T3, and pituitary mass.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Genuinely raised (free) T3 and T3/T4 ratio with nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal or high circulating FT3 and low-normal or low FT4 concentrations. This results in a raised T3/T4 ratio, despite normal TSH levels.

- **Dyshormonogenesis**: Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to the preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations. Chronic deficiency can cause goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio have been reported in the context of mild dyshormonogenic congenital hypothyroidism due to partial loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects. The hypersecretion of T3 is attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

- **Resistance to thyroid hormone α**: Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism. This is associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal or low FT4, high-normal or high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

- **Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency**: Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for the transport of thyroid hormones into the central nervous system, cause a disorder known as Allan–Herndon.

### Use of the free thyroxine index to refine the lower limit of a free thyroxine immunoassay for detection of secondary hypothyroidism [^1137Lksb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

To determine the utility of measuring free T4 index (FT4I) in patients with low free T4 (FT4) levels using immunoassay and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone for the evaluation of secondary hypothyroidism, we performed a retrospective medical chart review. This involved patients seen at a single institution as outpatients who had a simultaneously normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level, low FT4 level, and any FT4I measured between June 2014 and October 2016. Demographic, laboratory, and imaging data were collected. Using FT4I as the reference for diagnosis of hypothyroidism, the sensitivity and specificity of the FT4 immunoassay's lower-limit thresholds were determined. Within each threshold group, available brain imaging and biochemical evaluation were categorized according to the presence or absence of pituitary disease.

A total of 155 sets of result pairs (FT4 and FT4I) performed on 118 subjects were analyzed. The lower limit of a normal FT4 level by immunoassay at this institution was 0.93 ng/dL, though all pairs with FT4 ≥ 0.89 ng/dL had a normal FT4I. All pairs with FT4 ≤ 0.67 ng/dL had a low FT4I. No pituitary macroadenomas were identified in any subject, though the rates of pituitary imaging in this patient sample were low.

Patients with a borderline low FT4 level by immunoassay often have normal FT4I. In such patients at our center, significant structural and biochemical pituitary pathology was uncommon.
