## Question

Rationale for lung segmentectomy for lung cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the rationale for lung segmentectomy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical context and how guidelines have evolved. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial data that changed practice. Next, I will examine oncologic equivalence and where it breaks down, followed by functional advantages and patient selection criteria. After that, I need to check technical quality requirements and how they influence outcomes. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the historical baseline so I don't jump to conclusions: for decades, lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was the gold standard for resectable early-stage NSCLC, supported by the 1995 LCSG randomized trial showing higher local recurrence and worse survival with limited resections that mixed wedge and segmentectomy, which established lobectomy as the default for medically fit patients [^111WJoF8] [^112LaBbV].

> Wait, let me verify the modern randomized evidence that challenged that dogma. The JCOG0802/WJOG4607L phase 3 trial in peripheral clinical stage IA NSCLC ≤ 2 cm with CTR > 0.5 demonstrated that segmentectomy achieved superior 5-year overall survival (94.3% vs 91.1%) with similar relapse-free survival, albeit with higher locoregional recurrence (10.5% vs 5.4%), which fundamentally shifted the conversation toward segmentectomy as a standard option in this phenotype [^114ErD6C] [^111eMUzt].

> Hold on, I should also review the Western counterpart. The CALGB 140503/Alliance trial in patients with peripheral tumors ≤ 2 cm showed that sublobar resection (mostly segmentectomy) was noninferior to lobectomy for disease-free and overall survival, reinforcing the concept that appropriately selected sublobar resection can match lobectomy in outcomes while preserving lung tissue [^111zSiEu] [^112HNG3i].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about oncologic equivalence. Meta-analyses and contemporary reviews generally show no significant difference in overall or disease-free survival between segmentectomy and lobectomy for stage IA disease, though some analyses still signal higher local recurrence with segmentectomy and emphasize the importance of rigorous nodal assessment and margins to mitigate that risk [^116rCwYf] [^111dnfdj] [^111PE9H6].

> Let me consider functional advantages next. Segmentectomy preserves more lung parenchyma than lobectomy, and while the absolute FEV1 advantage at 12 months in JCOG0802 was modest (~3.5%), it reached statistical significance and may be clinically meaningful in patients with limited reserve or multimorbidity, aligning with physiologic guidance that sublobar resection reduces perioperative risk and long-term disability in high-risk patients [^114ErD6C] [^111yo9Fa] [^113Vn6qe].

> I should double-check patient selection because outcomes hinge on it. The strongest evidence supports segmentectomy for peripheral, node-negative tumors ≤ 2 cm, particularly with solid-predominant features (CTR > 0.5), while subsolid lesions with low CTR often have excellent biology and are ideal for limited resection. Conversely, larger solid tumors (> 3 cm), central location, or suspected nodal disease favor lobectomy, and emerging data suggest segmentectomy may still be reasonable up to 3 cm in select patients, though this remains investigational for some groups [^114ErD6C] [^114SZwLw] [^1153hfDU] [^111V42Nx].

> But wait, what if the real driver of equivalence is technical quality rather than extent alone? I need to check that. Segmentectomy must include anatomic division of the segmental bronchus and vessels with adequate parenchymal margins (ideally ≥ 2 cm or ≥ tumor diameter) and systematic nodal evaluation, because inadequate margins and insufficient nodal sampling are linked to higher recurrence and worse survival; quality audits show many so-called segmentectomies fail these standards, underscoring the need for adherence to oncologic principles [^116GjDmJ] [^113rxGQ8] [^116wce3D] [^115qhEFC].

> Next, I should review guideline convergence so I don't overstate any single position. ACCP 2025 recognizes segmentectomy as an equivalent alternative for peripheral ≤ 2 cm clinical stage I NSCLC in medically fit patients, NCCN supports sublobar resection for T1ab N0 tumors with adequate margins and nodal sampling, ESMO endorses segmentectomy for pure GGO or minimally invasive adenocarcinomas, and AATS expert consensus highlights the JCOG0802 results and emphasizes careful selection and quality execution [^114EPXE5] [^116GjDmJ] [^11411fWp] [^111eMUzt].

> Hold on, I should verify the balance of benefits and tradeoffs. Segmentectomy offers comparable or slightly superior overall survival in JCOG0802, better functional preservation, and lower perioperative risk in selected patients, but it carries a higher risk of locoregional recurrence and demands greater technical expertise and meticulous nodal assessment. Therefore, center experience and quality metrics matter, and patients must be counseled about recurrence risks and the importance of margins and nodal evaluation [^114ErD6C] [^113Vn6qe] [^116wce3D].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a peripheral clinical T1a–b N0 NSCLC ≤ 2 cm, segmentectomy with ≥ 2 cm margins and systematic nodal sampling/dissection is a reasonable first-line option in experienced hands, with lobectomy remaining appropriate if anatomy is unfavorable, margins are inadequate, or nodal risk is higher. For subsolid lesions with low CTR, segmentectomy is particularly attractive. For tumors 2–3 cm, segmentectomy may be considered in highly selected patients, ideally within trials or at high-volume centers. For patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve, segmentectomy is preferred over lobectomy when technically feasible [^114ErD6C] [^116GjDmJ] [^114SZwLw] [^1153hfDU] [^111V9j35].

> I should confirm special scenarios. In patients with prior lung resection or anticipated second primaries, segmentectomy preserves options for future anatomic resections and has acceptable oncologic outcomes when performed with adequate margins and nodal evaluation, though recurrence risk may be higher in those with prior resections, reinforcing the need for rigorous technique and follow-up [^117WArMt] [^111zSiEu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied segmentectomy is categorically superior to lobectomy; that overstates the evidence. The most defensible conclusion is that in carefully selected patients with small, peripheral, node-negative NSCLC, anatomically executed segmentectomy achieves oncologic outcomes comparable to lobectomy while better preserving lung function, but it requires strict adherence to margins and nodal assessment and should be individualized based on tumor biology, anatomy, and patient physiology [^114ErD6C] [^111eMUzt] [^116GjDmJ].

---

Segmentectomy is indicated for early-stage NSCLC (≤ 2 cm, peripheral, node-negative) [^114ErD6C] because it provides **oncologic equivalence to lobectomy** [^111zSiEu] with **superior preservation of lung function** [^111yo9Fa] and fewer complications [^113Vn6qe]. It is also preferred for patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve [^115SRGTq] or multiple comorbidities [^111V9j35], and for subsolid lesions with low invasive potential [^114SZwLw] [^11411fWp]. Segmentectomy is not recommended for tumors > 3 cm, central location, or suspected nodal disease due to higher recurrence risk [^116GjDmJ] [^111eMUzt]. Proper patient selection and adherence to oncologic principles — including adequate margins and lymph node assessment — are essential for optimal outcomes [^116GjDmJ] [^116wce3D].

---

## Oncologic rationale

### Tumor size and location

For tumors ≤ 2 cm, peripheral, and node-negative, **oncologic outcomes are comparable to lobectomy** [^114ErD6C] [^111zSiEu]. In contrast, larger (> 3 cm) or centrally located tumors carry a higher recurrence risk and are **not ideal for segmentectomy** [^111spnea].

---

### Histological subtype

Subsolid lesions (AIS, MIA) have low invasive potential, and **segmentectomy is effective** [^114SZwLw] [^11411fWp]. In contrast, solid-predominant or micropapillary tumors are more aggressive and may require **lobectomy for adequate control** [^111spnea].

---

### Lymph node involvement

Node-negative disease is essential; occult nodal disease increases recurrence risk and may **require lobectomy** [^114ErD6C] [^117ERDtf].

---

## Functional rationale

Segmentectomy preserves more lung parenchyma than lobectomy, resulting in **better postoperative pulmonary function** [^111yo9Fa] and fewer complications, particularly in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve [^114DWKRz].

---

## Patient selection criteria

| **Factor** | **Favorable for segmentectomy** | **Unfavorable for segmentectomy** |
|-|-|-|
| Tumor size | ≤ 2 cm | > 3 cm |
| Tumor location | Peripheral | Central |
| Lymph node status | Negative | Positive |
| Histology | Subsolid (AIS, MIA) | Solid-predominant, micropapillary |
| Pulmonary function | Limited reserve | Normal reserve |
| Comorbidities | Multiple | Minimal |

## Clinical evidence supporting segmentectomy

- **JCOG0802**: Segmentectomy showed superior overall survival (94.3% vs 91.1%) and similar relapse-free survival compared to lobectomy in tumors ≤ 2 cm [^114ErD6C] [^111eMUzt].
- **CALGB 140503**: Sublobar resection was non-inferior to lobectomy for overall and disease-free survival in peripheral tumors ≤ 2 cm [^111zSiEu] [^112HNG3i].
- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple studies confirm comparable survival and better pulmonary function with segmentectomy in early-stage NSCLC [^116rCwYf] [^111dnfdj].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

- **Tumor size**: > 3 cm increases recurrence risk and is a contraindication [^notfound].
- **Central location**: Higher recurrence risk, less suitable for segmentectomy [^116GjDmJ].
- **Lymph node involvement**: Requires lobectomy for adequate control [^116TyFQu].
- **Aggressive histology**: Solid-predominant or micropapillary tumors may need lobectomy [^111V42Nx].

---

## Technical considerations

- **Margins**: Adequate parenchymal margins (≥ 2 cm or ≥ tumor size) are critical [^116GjDmJ] [^117JmU5a].
- **Lymph node assessment**: Systematic lymph node sampling or dissection is essential [^116GjDmJ] [^116wce3D].
- **Minimally invasive techniques**: VATS or robotic approaches reduce morbidity and improve recovery [^116GjDmJ] [^116dTLvA].

Segmentectomy is a **valuable alternative to lobectomy** for early-stage NSCLC, especially in small, peripheral, node-negative tumors and in patients with limited pulmonary reserve. It offers comparable oncologic outcomes with better preservation of lung function, but requires careful patient selection and adherence to oncologic principles [^114ErD6C] [^111zSiEu].

### Meta-analysis of segmentectomy versus lobectomy for radiologically pure solid or solid-dominant stage IA non-small cell lung cancer [^1117SEt8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well established that GGO-dominant early lung NSCLC is associated with a good prognosis and that patients with these tumors are considered feasible candidates for limited surgical resection. However, radiologically determined solid-dominant tumors have a higher malignant potential than GGO-dominant tumors. At present, the use of segmentectomy for solid-dominant tumors as a radical procedure is controversial. Two randomized clinical trials evaluating sublobar resection for the treatment of solid lung cancer are ongoing in Japan and the United States. However, it is not clear whether these two trials will determine the role of segmentectomy for solid nodules because the clinical trial in Japan included tumors with GGO, and the other trial retains the sublobar treatment arm as the comparator to lobectomy rather than subdividing the patients into two groups of segmentectomy and wedge resection.

Most previous studies believe that segmentectomy can obtain similar survival outcomes as lobectomy even in stage IA NSCLC patients with a solid-dominant or pure solid appearance on radiology. However, we made efforts to extract all detailed information to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of lobectomy and segmentectomy for radiologically pure solid or solid-dominant stage IA non-small cell lung cancer and suggested a significant benefit of lobectomy over segmentectomy in terms of RFS in these patients. As Fig. 1 demonstrates, patients in the segmentectomy group had a risk of recurrence 1.46 times greater than those in the lobectomy group. Furthermore, the hazard ratio (HR) of RFS was higher in the subgroup of patients with stage IA (≤ 2 cm). In other words, lobectomy applied to a solid-dominant or pure solid tumor less than 2 cm in size had a greater survival advantage than segmentectomy. Two studies suggested that lobectomy had slightly worse survival outcomes than segmentectomy when the tumor was larger than 2 cm. One possible explanation for the inferior outcomes after lobectomy in these two studies was that distant recurrence was the first recurrence in many of these patients with solid-dominant or pure solid tumors larger than 2 cm, and even if the tumor was locally controlled by lobectomy, the survival outcomes for these patients may be poor because of distant recurrence. Solid or micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma, which may present radiographically as a solid tumor, was associated with a significantly poor prognosis. This finding may also be why the advantage of lobectomy was reduced in the pure solid subgroup analysis. The same results were reported in these articles.

### Lung-sparing surgery effective for early-stage lung cancer… [^111zSiEu]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

In the trial, people with early-stage NSCLC who had the more limited surgery lived as long without their cancer coming back as those who had an entire lobe of the lung removed. In addition, the portion of people still living after 5 years was about 80% in both groups. Results of the new study were reported February 9 in the. Together, the two trials show that carefully selected patients "can benefit from having less of their lung tissue removed to give them the same chance of a cure, " Dr. Cooke said. And removing less lung tissue "might mean better lung function long term". In 1995, results from a key clinical trial showed that, for people with early-stage NSCLC, removing a lobe was better than removing part of a lobe. Trial participants who had only part of the affected lobe removed were three times more likely than those who had a lobectomy have their cancer come back. To participate in the trial, people had to meet stringent criteria.

They had to have a single lung tumor that was 2 cm or less in size, was in the outer third of the lung, and had not spread to nearby lymph nodes or elsewhere in the body. Participants also could not have been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the cancer. Also noteworthy, in the Japanese trial all lung-sparing surgeries were done the same way, by removing a whole segment of the lung. Some surgeons think that surgery to take out a segment of the lobe, known as segmentectomy, "is a better operation" than removing a wedge-shaped piece, Dr. Cooke said, because segmentectomy also removes the associated lymph nodes in that portion of lung. "Although all these operations are now safe, lung-sparing surgery is associated with an even lower risk, than lobectomy, " Dr. Rusch wrote. Perhaps most important, removing less lung tissue is believed to preserve lung function.

However, neither trial found clinically meaningful differences in lung function between people who had a lobectomy and those who had lung-sparing surgery. Removing only a segment or a wedge offers another advantage for patients, Dr. Altorki said. People who are cured of their first non-small cell lung cancer are often at high risk of developing a second primary non-small cell lung cancer. And if a second lung cancer is found, people who initially had less lung tissue removed have more treatment options than those who had an entire lobe removed.

### Comparison of pulmonary segmentectomy and lobectomy: safety results of a randomized trial [^115AXnCu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

No definitive comparisons of surgical morbidity between segmentectomy and lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer have been reported.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to confirm the noninferiority of segmentectomy to lobectomy in regard to prognosis (trial No. JCOG0802/WJOG4607L). Patients with invasive peripheral non-small cell lung cancer tumor of a diameter ≤ 2 cm were randomized to undergo either lobectomy or segmentectomy. The primary end point was overall survival. Here, we have focused on morbidity and mortality. Predictors of surgical morbidity were evaluated by the mode of surgery. Segmentectomy was categorized into simple and complex. Simple segmentectomy was defined as segmental resection of the right or left segment 6, left superior, or lingular segment. Complex segmentectomy was resection of the other segment. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network — Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000002317).

Results

Between August 10, 2009, and October 21, 2014, 1106 patients (lobectomy n = 554 and segmentectomy n = 552) were enrolled. No mortality was noted. Complications (grade ≥ 2) occurred in 26.2% and 27.4% in the lobectomy and segmentectomy arms (P = 0.68), respectively. Fistula/pulmonary-lung (air leak) was detected in 21 (3.8%) and 36 (6.5%) patients in the lobectomy and segmentectomy arms (P = 0.04), respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that predictors of pulmonary complications, including air leak and empyema (grade ≥ 2) were complex segmentectomy (vs lobectomy) (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–3.88; p = 0.023), and > 20 pack-years of smoking (odds ratio, 2.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–5.97; p = 0.023).

Conclusions

There was no difference in almost any postoperative measure of intraoperative and postoperative complication in segmentectomy and lobectomy patients, except more air leakage was observed in the segmentectomy arm. Segmentectomy will be a standard treatment if the superior pulmonary function and noninferiority in overall survival are confirmed.

Regarding medical management for non-small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early-stage disease, surgery, technique, ACCP 2025 guidelines recommend to perform lobectomy over sublobar resection (segmentectomy or wedge resection) in medically fit patients with clinical stage II NSCLC.

Segmentectomy vs wedge resection — most reports of sublobar resection combine segmental resection and wedge resection patients together, which may not be appropriate because segmentectomy offers the potential advantage of complete resection of lymphatic and vascular drainage basins and frequently provides a better parenchymal margin; in general, the survival, and in particular, the local recurrence rate, appears to be substantially worse in patients undergoing wedge resection.

### Treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112cHaMc]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Surgical approach for clinical stage I–II NSCLC — medically fit patients: a lobectomy rather than sublobar resection is recommended (Grade1B). For patients with clinical stage I NSCLC who may tolerate operative intervention but not a lobar resection due to decreased pulmonary function or comorbid disease, sublobar resection is recommended over nonsurgical therapy (Grade 1B). Regardless of whether patients undergo wedge or segmentectomy, adequate margins should be achieved, and sublobar resection should involve an anatomic segmentectomy whenever possible.

### Treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111jAcgR]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) — patients unable to tolerate lobectomy or segmentectomy: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and surgical wedge resection are suggested (Grade 2C). Surgical resection has the potential benefit of definitive histologic analysis and pathologic nodal information; in compromised patients for whom such information would not change management SBRT is a preferred option, and SBRT is favored in patients for whom an adequate margin in unlikely with a surgical wedge resection. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may also be considered for peripheral tumors < 3 cm in inoperable patients.

### Survival outcomes of segmentectomy and lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XjXaX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In 1995, the first randomized controlled trial comparing lobectomy and sublobectomy was conducted and the results showed that sublobectomy had a higher mortality rate and three times the local recurrence rate compared to lobectomy, making the latter the gold standard treatment for early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

However, several studies have shown that segmentectomy and lobectomy result in similar overall survival rates and postoperative complications in patients with NSCLC less than 2 cm in size. Additionally, both procedures yield better survival outcomes compared to non-surgical methods such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. The debate about whether segmentectomy should be performed for all patients with early NSCLC, rather than just those with limited cardiopulmonary function, continues.

To clarify this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis that included mostly medium to high quality retrospective studies. However, with only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) included, subgroup analysis was not possible.

Segmentectomy is now considered an alternative to lobectomy for early-stage lung cancer, particularly in cases of restricted lung function or comorbidities that make lobectomy challenging. Our meta-analysis found no significant difference in OS, DFS or RFS between segmentectomy and lobectomy, with low heterogeneity. This finding supports the notion that lung segmentectomy is a reasonable option for early-stage lung cancer patients. Other meta-analyses also support this conclusion. A meta-analysis by Cao et al found no significant difference in OS and DFS between patients with early-stage NSCLC who intentionally opted for segmentectomy and those who underwent lobectomy. Conversely, patients with underlying conditions or limted cardiopulmonary function had significantly worse OS and DFS than patients with lobectomy. The results of a Phase III randomized controlled trial in Japan (JCOG0802 / WJOG4607L), published in April 2022, are encouraging. The segmentectomy is a viable option. The 5-year survival rate for the segmentectomy group was higher than that of the lobectomy group, and the 5-year recurrence-free survival was similar. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated its own Phase III randomized trial (CALGB 140,503) in 2008 to compare lobectomy and sublobectomy for the treatment of small peripheral NSCLC. The results of this trial have yet to be published.

### Surgical intervention for lung cancer in patients aged 75 and above: potential associations with increased mortality rates-a single-center observational study [^112HNG3i]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have challenged the notion that segmentectomy represents a compromise operation, suggesting that it may even be beneficial for lesions less than 2 cm, both in terms of complication rates and long-term survival. Notably, the results of the CALGB 140503 study, which randomised 701 patients with stage IA lung cancer to lobar and sublobar resections, demonstrated that after a 7-year follow-up, sublobar and lobar resections yielded similar disease-free and overall survival rates. The overall survival rates after 5 years were 80.3% for sublobar resection and 78.9% for lobar resection.

In our study, segmentectomy was performed in 19.2% of cases, emerging as the second most common procedure following lobectomy (68.5%). Remarkably, the complication rates did not exhibit significant differences between these two groups. Wedge resection has largely faded from the spectrum of treatment options, as it is no longer deemed radical enough and is reserved for severely ill patients, as previously described. Pneumonectomy is also witnessing a decline in popularity due to the poor tolerance of subsequent hemodynamic and ventilatory changes. In cases where pneumonectomy is being considered, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate the feasibility of sleeve resection, a procedure that necessitates a two-stage approach: first during preoperative planning and subsequently during intraoperative assessment. The open sleeve lobectomy technique should be integrated into the standard practice of every thoracic surgery department that manages lung cancer patients.

### Treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115nrgPA]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Stage I–II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) conclusion — In good-risk patients, treatment is primarily surgical resection. In the seventh edition staging system with size cutoffs for T1a tumors ≤ 2 cm, the application of sublobar resection and nonsurgical therapy is being actively investigated. The role of minimally invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in stage I–II NSCLC has increased since the last edition, while the best approach to high-risk early-stage patients remains controversial. For clinical stage I patients unable to tolerate lobectomy or segmentectomy, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and surgical wedge resection are recommended over no therapy. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II NSCLC appears clear, but the optimal treatment for larger node-negative tumors remains controversial.

Nonresectional treatment for clinical stage I NSCLC unable to tolerate lobectomy or segmentectomy — stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and surgical wedge resection are suggested over no therapy (Grade 2C).

### Sublobar resection or lobectomy for stage Ia non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Zqg3C]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Several international guidelines support the use of sublobar resection in selected patients with early-stage NSCLC. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends sublobar resection for peripheral tumours less than 2 cm in size with a consolidation-to-tumour ratio below 0.5 on CT imaging and no evidence of lymph node involvement. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) adopted a more conservative stance, considering anatomical segmentectomy acceptable primarily for pure ground-glass opacities or minimally invasive adenocarcinomas. In contrast, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence continues to recommend lobectomy as the standard approach for operable disease. The varied recommendations highlight ongoing uncertainty regarding oncological equivalence.

The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis that combined the extended evidence from RCTs and observational studies to determine whether lobectomy or sublobar resection results in improved outcomes for patients with stage Ia NSCLC.

Patient selection for sublobar resection in early-stage NSCLC emphasizes low nodal/locoregional risk and small tumor size, with most studies focusing on tumors of ≤ 2 cm; additional factors that may inform selection include solid versus subsolid radiographic appearance, PET standardized uptake value, cN1 status, solid or micropapillary versus acinar/lepidic histologic subtypes, and histologic evidence of lymphovascular invasion or spread through air spaces, while poor pulmonary reserve or other comorbidities may favor segmentectomy over lobectomy.

### Lobectomy versus segmentectomy in patients with stage T (> 2 CM and ≤ 3 CM) N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matching study [^113UDXxU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Surgery is the first-line treatment for NSCLC, and it is also the only method proven to cure lung cancer. Radical lobectomy resection remains the preferred treatment for early NSCLC. With the popularization of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening, the detection rate for patients with early lung cancer has improved, and segmentectomy is being more widely used as a surgical treatment. Recent studies revealed that patients with NSCLC who underwent segmentectomies for lesions < 2 cm obtained similar oncologic effects compared with those that received lobectomies. Patients receiving segmentectomies also retained more lung function. The NCCN guidelines indicate that the standard recommendation for the treatment of early NSCLC patients is anatomic pulmonary resection. These guidelines further state that sublobar resection (i.e. segmentectomy or wedge resection) can be appropriate in select patients with the following indications if technical conditions permit and do not increase the surgical risk: (1) Poor pulmonary reserve or another major comorbidity that contraindicates lobectomy; (2) Peripheral nodules ≤ 2 cm with at least one of the following, pure ADC in situ (AIS) on histopathology, nodules with ≥ 50% ground-glass appearance on CT scans, and radiologic surveillance confirming an extended doubling time (≥ 400 days).

### Segmentectomy versus wedge resection for non-small cell lung cancer in high-risk operable patients [^113rxGQ8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with early-stage lung cancer and limited pulmonary reserve may not be appropriate candidates for lobectomy. In these situations, sublobar resection (wedge or segmentectomy) is generally performed. Many physicians believe that segmentectomy is superior because it allows for an improved parenchymal margin and nodal sampling.

Methods

We performed an analysis using operative and pathology reports collected as part of planned data collection for American College of Surgeons Surgical Oncology Group (ACOSG) Z4032. This was a prospective trial in which patients with clinical stage I lung cancer and limited pulmonary function were randomized to sublobar resection with or without brachytherapy. The operative approach (video-assisted thoracic surgery [VATS] vs thoracotomy), extent of resection, and degree of lymph node evaluation were at the discretion of the individual surgeon. The primary aim of this analysis was to compare the parenchymal margin achieved between segmentectomy and wedge resection. Secondary aims included the extent of nodal staging and whether the operative approach (VATS vs open) had an effect on margin status and nodal evaluation.

Results

Among 210 patients, 135 (64%) underwent a VATS approach and 75 (36%) a thoracotomy. A segmentectomy was performed in 57 patients (27%) and a wedge resection in 153 patients (73%). There were no significant differences in the degree of nodal upstaging, stations sampled, or parenchymal margin obtained between VATS and thoracotomy. However, significant differences were observed between patients who underwent a segmentectomy and those who underwent a wedge resection with regard to parenchymal margin (1.5 cm vs 0.8 cm, p = 0.0001), nodal upstaging (9% vs 1%, p = 0.006), and nodal stations sampled (3 vs 1, p < 0.0001). Notably, 41% of patients treated by wedge resection had no nodes sampled at the time of operation compared with 2% of those who underwent segmentectomy (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In ACOSG Z4032, wedge resection, regardless of the approach, was associated with a smaller parenchymal margin and a lower yield of lymph nodes and rate of nodal upstaging when compared with segmentectomy.

Background

Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all malignant tumors worldwide, and surgical resection remains the gold standard for early-stage lung cancer. In the late 1990s, the advent of health screening and low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning led to the detection of an increasing number of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with diameter ≤ 2 cm. Since then, some researchers argue that sublobar resection can yield survival outcomes comparable to those of lobectomy in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC, and many studies have explored the optimal surgical procedure for early-stage lung cancer.

The JCOG0201 trial highlighted that imaging diagnosis specificity for non-invasive adenocarcinomas reached 98.7% for tumors ≤ 2 cm in long diameter with a ≤ 0.25 consolidation tumor ratio (CTR). Building upon these findings, the JCOG0804 study suggested that both wedge resection and segmentectomy can achieve radical cure. Further research has indicated that the pathological diagnosis of early lung cancer with nodules ≤ 2 cm in maximum diameter and CTR ≤ 0.5 typically show low invasiveness. The prognosis with wedge resection is not significantly different from that with lobectomy or segmentectomy. Sublobectomy is also recommended for these nodules according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Despite this, most current studies on sublobar resection for early lung cancer have primarily concentrated on traditional clinical outcomes, including postoperative complications, overall survival, and disease-free survival. These studies have consistently found that patients with early-stage NSCLC, especially those with predominantly ground-glass components, generally enjoy an excellent prognosis and tend to exhibit similar clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, traditional clinical outcomes fail to adequately consider the burden of postoperative symptoms. In recent years, as an increasing emphasis has been placed on the "patient-centered" medical approach in clinical practice, there has been a growing focus on patients' self-perception. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have gained prominence in the evaluation of the differences between procedures. PROs offer invaluable insights into patient's health status and treatment effects, enabling the assessment of symptom burden and functional impairment resulting from similar procedures. This information can assist clinicians in selecting the optimal surgical plan for clinical treatment.

### National trends in the quality of segmentectomy for lung cancer [^116wce3D]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Segmentectomy has become an accepted procedure for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Adequate lymph node sampling, sufficient margins, and proper tumor size selection are factors vital for achieving outcomes comparable to lobectomy. Previous studies have demonstrated poor adherence to lymph node sampling guidelines. However, national trends in the quality of segmentectomy and implications on survival are unknown.

Methods

The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with clinical stage I to IIA non-small cell lung cancer surgically treated between 2004 and 2018. Facility-level trends in extent of resection and segmentectomy odds of adherence to (1) 2014 Commission on Cancer guidelines of sampling 10 or more lymph nodes, (2) negative (R0) resection margins, and (3) tumor size 2 cm or less were determined. Propensity score matching was based on segmentectomy adherence to (4) a composite of all measures, and survival was evaluated with Cox models and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.

Results

The study included 249,391 patients with 4.4% (n = 11,006) treated with segmentectomy. The proportion of segmentectomies performed annually increased from 3.3% in 2004 to 6.1% in 2018 (P < .001). Overall, 12.6% (n = 1385) of patients who underwent segmentectomy between 2004 and 2018 were adherent to all measures, and adherence was more likely at academic programs (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–2.15) than nonacademic programs (P < .001, reference). Adherence to all measures was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.79).

Conclusions

As segmentectomy is increasingly established as a valid oncological option for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, it is important that quality remains high. This study demonstrates that continued improvement is needed.

### Survival following lobectomy vs limited resection for stage I lung cancer: a meta-analysis [^112LaBbV]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Limited resection for lung cancer was proposed in the early 1970s. Acceptable results of segmentectomy in a large number of patients were reported by. Since then, several retrospective studies considering efficacy of limited resection have been reported. In 1995, the Lung Cancer Study Group (LCSG) published final results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing local recurrence and survival after limited resection with those after standard lobectomy for stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Representing the only randomised trial worldwide to address the question of whether limited resection truly is comparable to standard lobectomy, that trial showed frequent locoregional recurrences and a tendency toward poorer survival in the limited resection group.

Although the randomised trial concluded that limited resection should not be standard surgery even for small peripheral NSCLC, several surgeons have continued to perform some intentional limited resections. Indeed, results reported from various institutions up to now have been conflicting. Considering recent implementation of minimally invasive surgical techniques such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), efficacy of limited resection in small, node-negative NSCLC needs to be re-evaluated.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to quantitatively review survival data for limited resection of lung cancer in comparison with data for standard lobectomy.

### Comparison of segmentectomy and lobectomy in Stage IA adenocarcinomas [^115uMNCq]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent studies have suggested that segmentectomy may be an acceptable alternative treatment to lobectomy for surgical management of smaller lung adenocarcinomas. The objective of this study was to compare survival after lobectomy and segmentectomy among patients with pathological stage IA adenocarcinoma categorized as stage T1b (> 0 to ≤ 20 mm) according to the new eighth edition of the TNM system.

Methods

In total, 7989 patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Propensity scores generated from logistic regression on preoperative characteristics were used to balance the selection bias of undergoing segmentectomy. Overall and lung cancer-specific survival rates of patients undergoing segmentectomy and lobectomy were compared in propensity score-matched groups.

Results

Overall, 564 patients (7.1%) underwent segmentectomy. Lobectomy led to better overall and lung cancer-specific survival than segmentectomy for the entire cohort (log-rank p < 0.01). After 1:2 propensity score matching, segmentectomy (n = 552) was no longer associated with significantly worse overall survival (5-year survival = 74.45% versus 76.67%, hazard ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 0.90–1.33) or lung cancer-specific survival (5-year survival = 83.89% versus 86.11%, hazard ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 0.86–1.46) compared with lobectomy (n = 1085) after adjustment for age, sex, lymph node quantity, and histological subtype. Similar negative findings were identified when patients were stratified according to sex, age, histological subtype, and number of evaluated lymph nodes.

Conclusions

Patients who underwent segmentectomy may have survival outcomes no different than those of some patients who received lobectomy for pathological stage IA adenocarcinomas at least 10 but no larger than 20 mm in size. These results should be further confirmed through prospective randomized trials.

### Segmentectomy as a safe and equally effective surgical option under complete video-assisted thoracic surgery for patients of stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^112t89J9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% of all lung cancers and the traditional treatment for stage I NSCLC is lobectomy. In 1973, Jensik et al published a study suggesting that segmental resection was equivalent to lobectomy and represented an adequate operation for stage I NSCLC. This publication started a debate regarding the optimal surgical approach for early stage NSCLC. Recently, as a result of an increasing incidence of small lung tumors, there has been renewed interest in the use of anatomic segmentectomy, especially for patients with stage IA NSCLC and those unable to tolerate lobectomy because of compromised medical condition. Several recently published studies have shown that segmentectomy could be performed safely without compromising oncologic results if patient selection for sublobar resection was adequate.

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has been introduced in a variety of thoracic operations, including small-sized lung cancer. VATS is less invasive and provides benefits due to decreased postoperative pain, shorter recovery, decreased inflammatory response and improved tolerance of chemotherapy. VATS can be generally classified into two categories of Hybrid-VATS and Complete-VATS (C-VATS). C-VATS, the pure video-based operation was the procedure we used in our studies.

Despite the growing acceptance of VATS lobectomy, VATS segmentectomy, especially C-VATS segmentectomy has not become widespread and remains highly controversial as a choice for treatment of small lung tumors. In addition to concerns about increased locoregional recurrence, potential arguments against VATS segmentectomy include higher rates of complications and inadequate nodal dissection because of the high complexity of the procedure. To date, there is scanty of data from published studies comparing clinical outcomes between VATS segmentectomy and VATS lobectomy except the data from Japan and US groups on selected patients. The purpose of this study was to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical outcomes of complete VATS segmentectomy compared with VATS lobectomy in stage I NSCLC patients under varying degree of surgical complexity.

### Segmentectomy vs lobectomy for occult N1 in non-small cell lung cancer: is less more? [^117ERDtf]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

With widespread adoption of segmentectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the need to convert segmentectomy to lobectomy for nodal disease comes into question. We aimed to determine whether extent of resection impacts overall survival or locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) in patients with occult N1 NSCLC.

Methods

We identified patients who underwent segmentectomy or lobectomy for NSCLC and were upstaged from cN0 to pN1 in our prospective institutional database from 01/2006–01/2023. Patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment, or parenchymal resection beyond the segment(s) or lobe of interest were excluded. Propensity-score weighting was used to control for potential confounders. Overall survival and LRFS were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios.

Results

Of 185 patients with occult N1 disease: 30 (16.2%) underwent segmentectomy and 155 (83.8%) lobectomy. Patients undergoing lobectomy had larger pathological tumor sizes than those undergoing segmentectomy (3.4cm [IQR:2.30–4.45] vs. 1.95cm [1.43–2.83], p < 0.005). There was no difference in rates of adjuvant therapy between segmentectomy and lobectomy (67% vs. 70%, p = 0.7). Median follow-up was 60 months. There were no differences in 5-year survival or LRFS between segmentectomy and lobectomy before or after propensity weighting (weighted overall survival:79.69% vs. 66.22%, log-rank p = 0.401). In multivariable analysis of survival and recurrence, procedure type was not a predictor of outcome.

Conclusions

Segmentectomy is associated with similar overall survival and LRFS to lobectomy for patients with occult N1 NSCLC.

### Segmentectomy as a safe and equally effective surgical option under complete video-assisted thoracic surgery for patients of stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^115pPScd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

VATS segmentectomy is a safe and equally effective option for selected patients of stage I NSCLC if performed by experienced thoracoscopic surgeons. With experience accumulated, minimally invasive strategies can be applied to more challenging operations, such as bilateral segmentectomy or in patients with compromised lung function where lobectomy is not an option.

### Segmentectomy versus wedge resection for stage I non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis [^114CR4Nk]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Segmentectomy and wedge resection have been recommended as appropriate surgical treatments for patients with poor pulmonary function or major comorbidities. However, for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is still undecided whether survival is better with segmentectomy or with wedge resection.

Methods

A meta-analysis was performed of studies examining survival outcomes after sublobar resection in patients with stage I NSCLC. Three electronic databases were searched to identify studies that investigated overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and disease-free survival between patients receiving segmentectomy versus wedge resection. A total of 19 relevant studies published before 31 April 2018 that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis.

Results

The 19 studies involved a total of 14,197 patients with stage I NSCLC. Overall survival was significantly better after segmentectomy than after wedge resection (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–0.88; P < 0.00001). This was also true of cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64–0.79; P < 0.00001) and disease-free survival (HR = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.54–0.98; P = 0.04). A fixed-model was applied for the analysis as there was no significant heterogeneity between the studies.

Conclusions

Survival after lobar resection for stage I NSCLC is significantly better with segmentectomy than with wedge resection.

### Segmentectomy versus lobectomy in small-sized peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (JCOG0802 / WJOG4607L): a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^114ErD6C]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lobectomy is the standard of care for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The survival and clinical benefits of segmentectomy have not been investigated in a randomised trial setting. We aimed to investigate if segmentectomy was non-inferior to lobectomy in patients with small-sized peripheral NSCLC.

Methods

We conducted this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial at 70 institutions in Japan. Patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC (tumour diameter ≤ 2 cm; consolidation-to-tumour ratio > 0·5) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either lobectomy or segmentectomy. Randomisation was done via the minimisation method, with balancing for the institution, histological type, sex, age, and thin-section CT findings. Treatment allocation was not concealed from investigators and patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival for all randomly assigned patients. The secondary endpoints were postoperative respiratory function (6 months and 12 months), relapse-free survival, proportion of local relapse, adverse events, proportion of segmentectomy completion, duration of hospital stay, duration of chest tube placement, duration of surgery, amount of blood loss, and the number of automatic surgical staples used. Overall survival was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a non-inferiority margin of 1·54 for the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) and estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. This study is registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000002317.

Findings

Between Aug, 10, 2009, and Oct 21, 2014, 1106 patients (intention-to-treat population) were enrolled to receive lobectomy (n = 554) or segmentectomy (n = 552). Patient baseline clinicopathological factors were well balanced between the groups. In the segmentectomy group, 22 patients were switched to lobectomies and one patient received wide wedge resection. At a median follow-up of 7·3 years (range 0·0–10·9), the 5-year overall survival was 94·3% (92·1–96·0) for segmentectomy and 91·1% for lobectomy (95% CI 88·4–93·2); superiority and non-inferiority in overall survival were confirmed using a stratified Cox regression model (HR 0·663; 95% CI 0·474–0·927; one-sided p < 0·0001 for non-inferiority; p = 0·0082 for superiority). Improved overall survival was observed consistently across all predefined subgroups in the segmentectomy group. At 1 year follow-up, the significant difference in the reduction of median forced expiratory volume in 1 sec between the two groups was 3·5% (p < 0·0001), which did not reach the predefined threshold for clinical significance of 10%. The 5-year relapse-free survival was 88·0% (95% CI 85·0–90·4) for segmentectomy and 87·9% (84·8–90·3) for lobectomy (HR 0·998; 95% CI 0·753–1·323; p = 0·9889). The proportions of patients with local relapse were 10·5% for segmentectomy and 5·4% for lobectomy (p = 0·0018). 52 (63%) of 83 patients and 27 (47%) of 58 patients died of other diseases after lobectomy and segmentectomy, respectively. No 30-day or 90-day mortality was observed. One or more postoperative complications of grade 2 or worse occurred at similar frequencies in both groups (142 [26%] patients who received lobectomy, 148 [27%] who received segmentectomy).

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this study was the first phase 3 trial to show the benefits of segmentectomy versus lobectomy in overall survival of patients with small-peripheral NSCLC. The findings suggest that segmentectomy should be the standard surgical procedure for this population of patients.

### Segmentectomy vs lobectomy for patients with 2-to 3-CM non-small cell lung cancer [^1153hfDU]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

JCOG0802 and CALGB 140503 recently demonstrated the noninferiority of sublobar resection to lobectomy in patients with T1a-bN0M0 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It remains unknown, however, whether segmentectomy is associated with similar oncologic outcomes to lobectomy for patients with node negative T1c tumors (i.e., those 2–3 cm in size).

Research Question

The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of patients undergoing segmentectomy vs. lobectomy for T1cN0M0 NSCLC.

Study Design and Methods

Patients in the National Cancer Database (2010–2020) who underwent segmentectomy or lobectomy for clinical T1cN0M0 NSCLC were identified for analysis. Only patients with no comorbidities were included in an effort to minimize selection bias. Overall survival of patients undergoing segmentectomy vs. lobectomy was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling and propensity-score matched analysis. These analyses were then repeated among a subset of patients with pathologic T1cN0M0 NSCLC.

Results

Of the 12,814 patients with cT1cN0M0 NSCLC identified, 526 (4.1%) underwent segmentectomy and 12,288 (95.9%) underwent lobectomy. Among patients with clinical T1c disease, there was no difference in overall survival among patients undergoing segmentectomy versus lobectomy in multivariable-adjusted (aHR 1.13, 95% CI [0.92–1.39], p = 0.23) or propensity-score matched analysis (5-year survival: 70.1% [95% CI: 63.8%-75.6%] vs 72.0% [95% CI: 65.6%-77.3%], p = 0.85). Similarly, among a subset of 8,502 patients with pathologic T1cN0M0 NSCLC, there was no difference in overall survival between patients undergoing segmentectomy or lobectomy in multivariable-adjusted (aHR 1.23, 95% CI [0.96–1.59], p = 0.11) or propensity-score matched analysis (5-year survival: 74.1% [95% CI: 66.7–80.2] vs 74.0% [95% CI: 66.4–80.2], p = 0.73).

Interpretation

In this national analysis, segmentectomy was noninferior to lobectomy for patients with clinical or pathologic T1c NSCLC. These findings suggest that future prospective studies comparing lobectomy and sublobar resection should consider including patients with larger tumors up to 3 cm as these patients may also benefit from parenchymal-sparing approaches.

### Survival outcomes of segmentectomy and lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112gkAjh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The question of whether segmentectomy and lobectomy have similar survival outcomes for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a matter of debate.

Methods

A cohort study and randomized controlled trial were included, comparing segmentectomy and lobectomy, by utilizing computerized access to the Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up until July 2022. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to evaluate the randomized controlled trials, while the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the cohort studies. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out.

Results

The analysis incorporated 17 literature studies, including one randomized controlled trial and 16 cohort studies, and was divided into a segmentectomy group (n = 2081) and a lobectomy group (n = 2395) based on the type of surgery the patient underwent. Each study was followed up from 27 months to 130.8 months after surgery. Over survival (OS): HR = 1.14, 95%CI(0.97,1.32), P = 0.10; disease-free survival (DFS): HR = 1.13, 95%CI(0.91,1.41), P = 0.27; recurrence-free survival (RFS): HR = 0.95, 95%CI(0.81,1.12), P = 0.54.

Conclusion

The results of the study suggest that the survival outcomes of the segmentectomy group were not inferior to that of the lobectomy group. Segmentectomy should therefore be considered as a treatment option for early stage NSCLC.

### Thoracoscopic segmentectomy compares favorably with thoracoscopic lobectomy for patients with small stage I lung cancer [^115x821z]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

As thoracoscopic lobectomy becomes widely applied for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, thoracoscopic segmentectomy remains controversial for patients with small stage I lung cancers. Questions remain regarding safety, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rate. This study compared outcomes between thoracoscopic segmentectomy and lobectomy.

Methods

Retrospective review was undertaken of patients who underwent thoracoscopic segmentectomy or lobectomy for clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer between January 2002 and February 2008. Indications for segmentectomy were tumor smaller than 3 cm, limited pulmonary reserve, comorbidities, and peripheral tumor location.

Results

Thirty-one patients underwent segmentectomy and 113 underwent lobectomy. Patients after segmentectomy had worse mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second than after lobectomy (83% vs 92%, P = 0.04). There were no differences in mean number of nodes (10) and nodal stations (5) resected. Segmentectomy and lobectomy groups had similar median chest tube durations (2 vs 3 days, P = 0.18), stays (both 4 days), total complications, recurrence rates, and survivals at mean follow-ups of 22 and 21 months, respectively. Lobectomy group had 1 30-day death; segmentectomy group had none. There were 5 (17.2%) recurrences after segmentectomy and 23 (20.4%) after lobectomy (P = 0.71), with locoregional recurrence rates of 3.5% and 3.6%, respectively.

Conclusion

Thoracoscopic segmentectomy is a safe option for experienced thoracoscopic surgeons treating patients with small stage I lung cancers. No significant difference in oncologic outcome was seen between thoracoscopic segmentectomy and thoracoscopic lobectomy. Lymph node dissection could be performed as effectively during segmentectomy as lobectomy.

### Lung cancer resection in patients with underlying usual interstitial pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^115hmGAE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The role of limited resection

Limited surgical resection in lung cancer has been increasingly adopted in recent years, for early stage solid and subsolid lesions, particularly in light of the findings from the recent JCOG0802 randomised controlled trialwhich assessed the 5-year outcomes following segmentectomy (sublobar) (n = 552) or lobectomy (n = 554) for stage Ia NSCLC less than or equal to 2 cm. Overall survival was 94.3% and 91.1%, respectively (p = 0.0082), yet there was no significant difference in disease-free survival; 88% and 87.9%, respectively. The proportion of locoregional recurrence in the segmentectomy arm was significantly higher than the lobectomy arm, 10.5% vs 5.4% (p = 0.0018), respectively. In this particular field, there is limited scope to delineate between segmentectomy and lobectomy hence the discussion will also compare sublobar (wedge resection and segmentectomy combined) to lobar resection, which is a reflection of the paucity of large-scale robust data.

### Sublobar resection or lobectomy for stage Ia non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PE9H6]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

In our study, we included both segmentectomy and non-anatomical wedge resection in the sublobar group. This decision was made to reflect the inclusion criteria of high-profile RCTs in this research area. However, many would argue that a segmentectomy is superior to a wedge resection in terms of oncological resection given the anatomical resection boundaries. Still, including wedge resections with segmentectomies may reflect a more realistic and pragmatic surgical approach. So far, two RCTs have randomised patients to segmentectomy specifically for comparison with lobectomy and they have reached differing conclusions. Meta-analyses that have included only segmentectomies and compared with lobectomy for early stage NSCLC have shown similar results to our study and subgroup analysis for segmentectomy onlywith similar findings for survival and disease recurrence.

Our findings also contribute to ongoing debate around international guideline recommendations. While both the ESMO and NCCN recommend sublobar resection for selected patients with early-stage NSCLC with favourable tumour characteristics, these guidelines are nuanced and not universally adopted. For instance, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence does not currently recommend sublobar resection as a first-line option. The comparable overall and DFS demonstrated in this meta-analysis, particularly within rigorously staged cohorts, supports a reassessment of these recommendations and suggests that sublobar resection may be a valid alternative to lobectomy in appropriately selected patients.

### Is lobectomy actually worse than segmentectomy for all stage I non-small cell lung cancer? [^116noXvU]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recent results of the JCOG 0802 and CALGB 140503 studies suggest that segmentectomy should be considered instead of lobectomy for patients with peripheral < 2 cm node-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to test this hypothesis in a retrospective analysis of a larger dataset of patients with stage I NSCLC recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.

Methods

Patients with all stage I NSCLC (≤ 4 cm in size) who underwent either segmentectomy or lobectomy from 2000 to 2017 were analyzed. The primary endpoints were overall survival and lung cancer-specific survival, while the secondary endpoints were the 30-day and 90-day mortality.

Results

Overall, 32,673 patients treated by lobectomy and 2166 patients treated by segmentectomy were included in the initial data collection. After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 2016 patients in each group were enrolled in the final analysis with well-balanced baseline characteristics. After PSM, there was no difference between segmentectomy and lobectomy for all stage IA NSCLC (≤ 3 cm in size) in both overall survival and lung cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0.87 [0.74–1.02], P value: 0.09 and hazard ratio: 0.81 [0.4–1.03], P value: 0.09, respectively). Furthermore, lobectomy had higher 30-day mortality than segmentectomy: 1.1% versus 2.1%, P value: 0.01. However, this difference was not significant for 90-day mortality, even after PSM (3.9% versus 3.0%, P value: 0.17).

Conclusions

We found no evidence to support the use of lobectomy rather than segmentectomy in stage IA NSCLC in terms of either overall or lung cancer-specific long-term survival. The choice of lobectomy may also be detrimental to early postoperative recovery.

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 1.

1 General introduction Despite recent major improvements in diagnosis, staging and treatment, lung cancer remains to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Since the demonstration of superiority over sublobar lung resection, the current standard-of-care for small lung cancer is a lobectomy. In a lobectomy, one of the three or two lobes is excised. Albeit effective with respect to the radical excision of the tumour, the substantial loss in lung tissue may be clinically relevant, especially in combination with frequently co-existing lung diseases. This is made possible due to high resolution medical imaging that enables surgeons to precisely locate small tumors. This paved the way for segmentectomy. Thoracoscopic segmentectomy is a combination of adequate oncological resection with lung-tissue-sparing properties and is being increasingly used because of its several advantages compared with lobar resections.

Local recurrences after surgical resection are correlated to the length of the safety margins. These margins are defined by guidelines. By defining the segment that has to be excised pre-operatively, the key to successful pulmonary segmentectomy is to subsequently intraoperatively recognize the intersegmental planes correctly. Although the intersegmental plane is regulated by intersegmental veins, it would be impossible to detect and follow these veins in the distal lung parenchyma, therefore, it is mandatory to identify the intersegmental plane before dividing the lung parenchyma.

### Lobectomy versus segmentectomy in patients with stage T (> 2 CM and ≤ 3 CM) N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matching study [^115bVyc1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer accounts for 11.6% of all cancers and 18.4% of cancer deaths. Malignant tumors are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality rates. The most recent estimate predicts 228,820 new cases and 135,720 deaths in 2020, demonstrating the tremendous global impact of this disease, which has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 19%. Surgery is the preferred treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and it is also the only proven method to cure lung cancer. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend lobectomy as the first-line treatment for early NSCLC. High-resolution computed tomography has increased the detection rate of early lung cancer. Compared with traditional lobectomy, segmentectomy fulfills the oncological requirements and also reduces some loss of lung function. However, there is controversy regarding whether segmental resection is more appropriate than lobectomy for surgical treatment of early NSCLC. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of patients with NSCLC after segmentectomy compared to those after lobectomy. We used a population-based national registry, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognoses of patients with T (> 2 and ≤ 3 cm) N0M0 NSCLC who received either segmentectomy or lobectomy. Based on the survival analysis results, we created forest plots using the Cox proportional hazards model.

### Wedge resection versus lobectomy in T1 lung cancer patients: a propensity matched analysis [^117764tL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer has one of the poorest 5-year survival rates amongst all cancers. This has not improved much in the last three decades and remains around 15%. Surgery can often be curative however the majority of patients present at a late stage where surgery has no role to play. Early detection has been studied over the last two decades and the need for lung cancer screening has been piloted in the UK. Surgery is offered to stage I and II lung cancer patients and lobectomy has been the gold standard surgical procedure in the management of early stage lung cancer based upon the only randomised control trial comparing the two procedures in 1995. Non-anatomical wedge resection was found to be associated with a higher rate of recurrence at 5 years. Historically, non-anatomical wedge resection has been offered based on clinical judgment taking into consideration the patient's performance status, lung function and comorbidities. The last decade witnessed massive adoption of video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) procedures, initiating revolution in the surgical management of lung cancer with some units in the UK achieving 90% of total resections by VATS surgery.

Recent published data showed no survival advantages for non-anatomical wedge versus lobectomy in octogenarian patients in early stage lung cancer. As a result of this emerging evidence and smaller tumours being picked up by screening, the choice between sub-lobar and anatomical resection is very much influenced by the surgeon and institutions experience. Segmentectomy is considered to be superior to wedge resection due to improved lymph node clearance and larger tumour margin which leads to higher survival rates. Data from the National Lung Cancer Audit classifies segmentectomy and wedge resection under a 'sub-lobar' category which does not distinguish them as separate entities, although many thoracic surgeons would not class them as oncologic equivalent procedures.

European guidelines recommend that anatomical resection should be performed over wedge resection and that lobectomy should still be the standard of care in patients with tumour size of 2 cm or greater. American guidelines suggest that parenchymal sparing procedures may infer benefit to those who are aged over 75 years. In contrast, British guidelines advise that age over 80 alone should not be a contraindication to lobectomy. It is worth noting that a number of these guidelines have not been updated for some time and surgical techniques, as well as adjuvant therapy have vastly improved. In the UK, lobectomy is the mainstay of treatment, accounting for around 77% of surgeries, followed by wedge resection at around 19%.

Sublobar resection in stage I–II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is framed with lobectomy as the standard extent of resection and the gold standard based on the Lung Cancer Study Group trial published in 1995 noting lower local recurrence and trends toward improved survival; most comparative evidence is limited because many sublobar series lack a lobectomy control and nonrandomized cohorts are subject to substantial confounding, while thoracotomy data suggest better tolerability for sublobar resection and the impact with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is undefined; Figure 6 compiles comparative outcomes across randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective studies, large database comparisons, case-matched studies, and selected uncontrolled cohorts, and illustrates results such as Kondo 2003 (stage Ia ≤ 2cm) showing 5-year survival 90 for lobectomy versus 89 for wedge and segmentectomy (W/S, NS) and local recurrence 1 versus 3; the rationale for sublobar resection is divided into three patient groups: those not able to tolerate lobectomy, good-risk patients who could tolerate lobectomy, and specific subgroups who could tolerate lobectomy but may have tumors for which lobectomy may not be necessary.

### Operative techniques in early-stage lung cancer [^111v2iSP]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of death by malignancy, responsible for more deaths than the next 4 causes combined and predicted to account for nearly 220,000 new cancer diagnoses and 160,000 deaths in 2009. The cornerstone of therapy for early-stage lung cancer is lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Although lobectomy is considered the standard procedure, segmentectomy may be appropriate for selected patients. Conventional approaches to resection may be used, including posterolateral and muscle-sparing thoracotomy. However, minimally invasive lobectomy and segmentectomy procedures are now commonly used with superior outcomes.

### Anatomic segmentectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer in the elderly [^114DWKRz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Anatomic segmentectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) offers the potential of surgical cure with preservation of lung function. This may be of particular importance in elderly NSCLC patients with declining cardiopulmonary status and a limited life expectancy.

Methods

The study compared outcomes of 78 elderly patients (aged > 75 years) with stage I NSCLC undergoing segmentectomy and 106 undergoing lobectomy for stage I NSCLC from 2002 to 2007. Primary outcome variables included perioperative morbidity and mortality, hospital course, recurrence patterns, and survival.

Results

Age, gender, tumor histology, and surgical approach were similar between groups. Comorbidities were similar except for a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes in segmentectomy patients. The tumors in the lobectomy group were significantly larger (3.5 vs 2.5 cm, p = 0.0001). Operative mortality was 1.3% for segmentectomy and 4.7% for lobectomy. Segmentectomy patients had fewer major complications (11.5% vs 25.5%, p = 0.02). There were no differences in median hospitalization (7 vs 6 days). The estimated overall survival at 2, 3, and 5 years was 76%, 69%, and 46% for segmentectomy patients and 68%, 59%, and 47% for lobectomy patients (p = 0.28). The 5-year disease-free survival was equivalent (segmentectomy, 49.8%; lobectomy, 45.5%; p = 0.80).

Conclusions

Anatomic segmentectomy can be performed safely in elderly patients with early-stage NSCLC. This approach is associated with reduced perioperative complications and comparable oncologic efficacy compared with lobectomy in older patients with a limited life expectancy.

### Pulmonary segmentectomy: results and complications [^112FZXS4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Segmentectomy is an anatomic pulmonary parenchymal-sparing resection performed for certain benign lesions and on selected patients with lung cancer. We reviewed our experience with segmentectomy in this highly select group of patients.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 61 patients (5% of all anatomic resections) undergoing 62 segmentectomies from 1991 to 2001. Wedge resections were excluded. The operative indications were suspected or known lung cancer (43), benign disease (12), and metastatic cancer to the lung (7). Median follow-up for patients with malignancy was 28 months (range 1 to 89 months). Actuarial survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

Segmentectomy was performed in 43 lung cancer patients with pathologic stages of Ia-22, Ib-14, IIa-2, IIb-1, IIIa/IIIb-2, and IV-2. All resection margins were negative for malignancy. Segmentectomy for benign diseases included granulomatous disease (5), pulmonary abscess (2), plasmacytoma (1), and others (4). Complications occurred in 39% (24/62) of patients, including atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy (10/62, 16%), pneumonia (9/62, 14%), air leak more than 7 days (5/62, 8%), and supraventricular dysrhythmias (6/62, 10%). In-hospital mortality was 3% (2 patients). Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (range 4 to 66 days). In the lung cancer patients the locoregional recurrence rate was 0% and the distant recurrence rate was 20%. The 4-year actuarial survival for patients with lung cancer was 72%.

Conclusions

Pulmonary segmentectomy has acceptable morbidity and mortality in selected patients with both benign and malignant lung disease and remains a useful procedure in a thoracic surgeon's armamentarium. Distant, not locoregional recurrence, was responsible for the cancer deaths.

### Pattern of metastasis outside tumor-bearing segments in primary lung cancer: rationale for segmentectomy [^1175J8o6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patterns of intrapulmonary metastasis, particularly metastasis outside tumor-bearing segments, were investigated in lung cancer patients to address the rationale for segmentectomy.

Methods

In a consecutive series of patients who underwent resection of two or more pulmonary segments for primary lung cancer, intrapulmonary spread patterns, such as segmental/intersegmental node metastasis and pulmonary parenchymal metastasis, were pathologically examined.

Results

Eligible 244 lesions included 167 adenocarcinomas, 66 squamous cell carcinomas, and 11 large cell carcinomas. Pathologic stages included 0 to IA (n = 111), IB (n = 56), IIA (n = 31), IIB (n = 20), IIIA (n = 23), and IIIB to IV (n = 3); and N1 (n = 26) and N2 (n = 22). Intrapulmonary spread was observed in 24 cases (9.8%). Of these, metastasis outside tumor-bearing segments was only observed in 4 cases (1.6%), and such cancer spread was more frequently seen in cases with extrapulmonary (hilar to mediastinal) nodal metastasis (7.9%) than in cases without extrapulmonary metastasis (0.5%; p = 0.01). Metastasis outside tumor-bearing segments was not observed in 64 tumors with pure or mixed ground glass opacity features on computed tomography. Although tumor location (peripheral or central/intermediate) was not related to the incidence of metastasis outside tumor-bearing segments, intrapulmonary spread was observed in only 1 of 52 peripheral small (≤ 20 mm) tumors.

Conclusions

Metastasis outside tumor-bearing segments is rarely observed in cases with tumors (1) without extrapulmonary nodal metastasis and (2) with ground glass opacity or peripheral small (≤ 20 mm) features.

### Sublobar resection or lobectomy for stage Ia non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dnfdj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Lung resection surgery is the standard management approach for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); traditionally, this has been in the form of a lobectomy. Survival following lobectomy for stage I NSCLC can be as high as 80% at 10 years. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards the use of sublobar resections which limit the resection of normal lung tissue, especially in small, early stage tumours. Segmentectomy offers an anatomical lung cancer resection while sparing more tissue than a lobectomy. A wedge resection is not an anatomical resection but removes the tumour and a margin of normal lung tissue. The preservation of normal lung tissue is thought to result in preserved lung function and improved postoperative physical function. However, there are concerns about oncological outcomes following a more limited resection, particularly regarding the incidence of local disease recurrence.

The choice between lobectomy and sublobar resection remains a key consideration in the surgical management of early-stage NSCLC. Previous meta-analyses have examined this comparison but reached conflicting conclusions about whether one approach offers superior outcomes. Two major randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2022 significantly added to the evidence base. The JCOG0802 trialrandomised patients with clinical stage Ia NSCLC to lobectomy or segmentectomy and reported a modest overall survival benefit with segmentectomy, alongside higher loco-regional recurrence but better preservation of postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). The CALGB/Alliance trialcompared lobectomy with either segmentectomy or wedge resection and concluded that sublobar resection was non-inferior to lobectomy in terms of both overall and disease-free survival (DFS). While some recent meta-analyses have incorporated these two RCTs, they were restricted to randomised evidence alone and did not consider lymph node sampling strategies.

### Segmentectomy versus lobectomy in small-sized peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer with radiologically pure-solid appearance in Japan (JCOG0802 / WJOG4607L): a post-hoc supplemental analysis of a multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial [^1172SK1Y]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

Although segmentectomy was better than lobectomy in terms of overall survival for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a pure-solid tumour appearance on thin-section CT in the open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 JCOG0802/WJOG4607L trial, the reasons why segmentectomy was associated with better overall survival were unclear. We aimed to compare the survival, cause of death, and recurrence patterns after segmentectomy versus lobectomy in trial participants with NSCLC with a pure-solid appearance METHODS: We conducted a post-hoc supplemental analysis of the JCO0802/WJOG4607L randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial for the patients (aged 20–85 years) with small-sized NSCLC with radiologically pure-solid appearance on thin-section CT (≤ 2 cm, consolidation tumour ratio 1·0). The primary aim was to compare the overall and relapse-free survival, cause of death, and recurrence patterns associated with segmentectomy and lobectomy for patients with radiologically pure-solid NSCLC to determine why the overall survival of segmentectomy was superior to that of lobectomy, even for oncologically invasive lung cancers. JCO0802/WJOG4607L is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000002317, and is complete.

Findings

Between Aug 10, 2009, and Oct 21, 2014, 1106 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either lobectomy or segmentectomy. Of these participants, 553 (50%) had radiologically pure-solid NSCLC and were eligible for this post-hoc supplemental analysis. Of these 553 participants, 274 (50%) patients underwent lobectomy and 279 (50%) underwent segmentectomy. Median patient age was 67 years (IQR 61–73), 347 (63%) of 553 patients were male and 206 (37%) were female, and data on race and ethnicity were not collected. As of data cutoff (June 13, 2020), after a median follow-up of 7·3 years (IQR 6·0–8·5), the 5-year overall survival rate was significantly higher after segmentectomy than after lobectomy (86·1% [95% CI 81·4–89·7] in the lobectomy group, with 55 deaths vs 92·4% [88·6–95·0] in the segmentectomy group, with 38 deaths; hazard ratio (HR) 0·64 [95% CI 0·41–0·97]; log-rank test p = 0·033), whereas the 5-year relapse-free survival was similar between the groups (81·7% [95% CI 76·5–85·8], with 34 events vs 82·0% [76·9–86·0], with 52 events; HR 1·01 [95% CI 0·72–1·42]; p = 0·94). Deaths after a median follow-up of 7·3 years due to lung cancer occurred in 20 (7%) of 274 patients after lobectomy and 19 (7%) of 279 after segmentectomy, and deaths due to other causes occurred in 35 (13%) patients after lobectomy compared with 19 (7%) after segmentectomy (lung cancer death vs other cause of death, p = 0·19). The locoregional recurrence was higher after segmentectomy (21 [8%] vs 45 [16%]; p = 0·0021). In subgroup analyses, better 5-year overall survival after segmentectomy than after lobectomy was observed in the subgroup of patients aged 70 years or older (77·1% [95% CI 68·2–83·8] with lobectomy vs 85·6% [77·5–90·9] with segmentectomy; p = 0·013) and in male patients (80·5% [73·7–85·7] vs 92·1% [87·0–95·2]; p = 0·0085). By contrast, better 5-year relapse-free survival after lobectomy than after segmentectomy was observed in the subgroup younger than 70 years (87·4% [95% CI 81·2–91·7] with lobectomy vs 84·4% [77·9–89·1] with segmentectomy; p = 0·049) and in female patients (94·2% [87·6–97·4] vs 82·2% [73·2–88·4]; p = 0·047).

Interpretation

This post-hoc analysis showed improved overall survival after segmentectomy in patients with pure-solid NSCLC compared with lobectomy. However, survival outcomes of segmentectomy depend on the patient's age and sex. Given the results of this exploratory analysis, further research is necessary to determine clinically relevant indications for segmentectomy in radiologically pure-solid NSCLC.

### Summary report of the standards, options and recommendations for the management of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (2000) [^114UKZh8]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Surgical limitations related to patient characteristics

In strictly selected patients, age is not an absolute contra-indication for surgical excision for lung cancer (standard, level of evidence: B2). A previous malignancy outside the lung is not a contra-indication for planned curative excision (standard).

Surgery should be the treatment of choice for patients with metachronous cancers, as for patients with primary lung cancer (standard, level of evidence: D).

Cancer in a single lung after pneumonectomy can be treated by conservative resection in patients with the following criteria (option): initial cancer with a good prognosis (stage I or II), no metastases detected, no nodal involvement at mediastinoscopy, good performance status, and absence of cardiovascular disease.

In elderly patients, conservative excision techniques should be undertaken (lobectomy, segmentectomy) (recommendation). Severe vascular disease should be treated prior to lung surgery (recommendation). Lung function should be evaluated by VO₂ max determination. The threshold for operability is a VO₂ max of about 15 mL kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ (recommendation).

### Survival after segmentectomy and wedge resection in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer [^112cpZUr]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although lobectomy is considered the standard surgical treatment for stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), wedge resection or segmentectomy are frequently performed on patients who are not lobectomy candidates. The objective of this study was to compare survival among patients with stage IA NSCLC, who are undergoing these procedures.

Methods

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry, we identified 3525 patients. We used logistic regression to determine propensity scores for patients undergoing segmentectomy, based on the patient's preoperative characteristics. Overall and lung cancer-specific survival of patients treated with wedge resection versus segmentectomy was compared after adjusting, stratifying, or matching patients based on propensity score.

Results

Overall, 704 patients (20%) underwent segmentectomy. Analyses, adjusting for propensity scores, showed that segmentectomy was associated with significant improvement in overall (hazard ratio: 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.69–0.93) and lung cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.59–0.88) compared with wedge resection. Similar results were obtained when stratifying and matching by propensity score and when limiting analysis to patients with tumors sized less than or equal to 2 cm, or aged 70 years or younger.

Conclusions

These results suggest that segmentectomy should be the preferred technique for limited resection of patients with stage IA NSCLC. The study findings should be confirmed in prospective studies.

### The impact of segmentectomy versus lobectomy on pulmonary function in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis [^111yo9Fa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgical resection for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the standard treatment that leads to the best chance of a cure. For the 100-year history of surgery, lobectomy has remained the gold standard for operable NSCLC. In recent years, segmentectomy has been reported as an alternative to lobectomy for small-sized NSCLC without detriment in survival. Theoretically, segmentectomy has an advantage over lobectomy on anatomical functional. However, the long-term benefits of segmentectomy over lobectomy on pulmonary function have not been firmly established. Reports related to the utility of segmentectomy in preserving lung function are conflicting. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to compare postoperative changes in pulmonary function in NSCLC patients undergoing segmentectomy or lobectomy.

### Lobectomy versus segmentectomy in patients with stage T (> 2 CM and ≤ 3 CM) N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matching study [^116EMPSQ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Compared with lobectomy, a major advantage of segmentectomy is the preservation of lung function. In theory, segmentectomy remove less lung tissue; however, preservation depends on the residual lung function after surgery. Therefore, the impact of the two procedures on lung function remains uncertain. Harada et al. reported that segmentectomy preserved more lung function than lobectomy, with segmentectomy exhibiting less lung function losses after surgery. Gu et al. indicated that segmentectomies could help minimize forced vital capacity (FVC) loss, but not forced expiratory volume in 1 min (FEV₁) or the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). For a single lung segment resected after segmentectomy, the loss of lung function is twice that after lobectomy. However, for multiple pulmonary nodules, segmentectomy can potentially reduce the loss of lung function even further. Waller et al. reported that for multiple primary lung cancer types, segmentectomy is recommended, and lung resection should be avoided; segmentectomy can also allow the performance of future lobectomies. Therefore, compared with lobectomy, segmentectomy could have more advantages for the retention of lung function over the short-term. The advantages of long-term lung function retention after segmentectomy requires further exploration. In the current study, we were unable to compare the differences in lung function concerning long-term survival after lobectomy vs. segmentectomy because of database limitations.

Limitations

As our data were collected from the SEER database, some biases and errors exist despite our PSM analysis. Limitations included (1) lack of detailed information regarding pre-, peri-, and postoperative patient details and outcomes; (2) none or unknown variables (such as tumor component) were grouped together, which could have led to data biases; (3) the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system was used, which possessed some inconsistencies in the data transformation process compared with earlier versions; and (4) the SEER database lacked information on imaging, smoking history, tumor markers, previous target therapy or immunotherapy, as well as several other parameters; therefore, our study could not address the impact of these factors on patient prognoses after segmentectomy or lobectomy, although they could have played significant roles.

Subsolid lung nodules — biopsy versus upfront resection: For a patient with near-certain adenocarcinoma risk, a growing, ≥ 8 mm peripheral lesion "should very likely undergo wedge resection without preliminary needle biopsy when that lesion becomes threatening", and "segmentectomy may also be reasonable for a lesion nearing 100% diagnostic certainty on pretest probability that it is a cancer". In contrast, patients not at high risk and/or with lesions requiring larger anatomic resection "should likely undergo an attempt at bronchoscopic or transthoracic needle biopsy in order to try to establish a diagnosis presection", recognizing that a nonspecific negative biopsy requires caution and that "resection or continued radiographic surveillance is required".

### Survival outcomes of segmentectomy and lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TQNYP]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. With growing public awareness and rapid advancements in imaging technologies and devices, early-stage NSCLC is being detected more frequently. Since 1995, lobectomy with lymph node dissection has been considered the gold standard for stage I NSCLC surgery This decision was based on a randomized controlled study conducted by the Lung Cancer Study Group (LCSG), which reported that patients who underwent limited resection, including wedge resection and segmentectomy, had lower overall survival (OS) and higher recurrence rates compared to those who underwent lobectomy. However, one limitation of this trial was that wedge section and segmentectomy were not performed separately. The lower OS and higher recurrence rates in the limited resection group may have been related to the failure of wedge section to effectively remove the lymph nodes.

More recently, in April 2022, researchers published the results of a multicenter, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial that compared segmentectomy and lobectomy in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC. The results showed that the 5-year survival and 5-year recurrence rates were comparable between the segmentectomy and lobectomy groups, with the latter group retaining more lung function. As a result, segmentectomy is now recommended as a standard procedure for patients with small-peripheral NSCLC.

To further evaluate the survival outcomes of patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent segmentectomy or lobectomy, we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies. Our review analyzed the available data quantitatively and compared the survival rates of patients who underwent these two surgical procedures.

### Lobectomy versus segmentectomy in patients with stage T (> 2 CM and ≤ 3 CM) N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matching study [^112DpQvR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

However, the more appropriate surgical treatment for patients with early-stage NSCLC remains debatable. As a minimally invasive procedure, lobectomies do not retain as much normal lung tissue as possible under the premise of ensuring efficacy. Segmentectomy involves more anatomic complexity and variation than lobectomy, and requires precise lesion positioning during surgery and the identification of lung boundaries. Therefore technically, segmentectomy is a more difficult and demanding procedure than lobectomy. However, TS is an influencing factor for early NSCLC prognoses. The results of an ongoing Randomized Controlled Trial (JCOG0802), have not reached a conclusion. However, Dai et al. reported that patients with NSCLC with tumors < 1 cm or between 1 and 2 cm receiving segmentectomies had worse OS and LCSS than patients receiving lobectomies. Veluswamy et al. demonstrated that in patients with ADC tumors < 2 cm, the OS and LCSS after segmentectomy were similar to those of lobectomy. For SCCs, the OS and LCSS after segmentectomy were inferior to those of lobectomy. In our study, regarding the surgical procedure, we observed that before PSM, for OS and CSS, lobectomy achieved better outcomes than segmentectomy in early T (> 2 cm and ≤ 3 cm) N0N0 NSCLC lung cancer. However, similar to recent studies, after PSM, our results revealed no significant differences in patient survival between those receiving lobectomy vs. segmentectomy. Our research shows that for the T (> 2 cm and ≤ 3 cm) N0N0 stage, segmentectomy and lobectomy achieved the same clinical benefit and prognoses regarding OS and LCSS in patients with NSCLC. Nevertheless, further studies are required focusing on the solid component effects and pathologic tumor types with respect to segmentectomies. In addition, age has been identified as a prognostic factor for OS and LCSS. With expanded cancer screening and the wide use of low-dose computed tomography, more patients are being diagnosed at an earlier age. Recently, researchers suggested that postoperative complications are similar between the two procedures. Therefore, whether segmentectomy can be safely and effectively applied in early NSCLC requires further research. This study provides a clinical basis for further investigation by the JCOG0802/WJOG4607L, JCOG1211, JCOG0804/WJOG4507L clinical trials.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to patients with additional pulmonary nodules (same lobe), ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend to perform resection via a lobectomy in patients with NSCLC and an additional focus of cancer within the same lobe (and no mediastinal or distant metastases).

Compromised patients and nonsurgical comparators — the available studies show that the perioperative mortality is around 5% even though the resection involved a thoracotomy, and that long-term survival is quite good; comparing across studies, the outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy appear to be worse than what is reported for segmentectomy or wedge resection in compromised patients, and at this time it appears that sublobar resection is favored over nonsurgical therapy in compromised patients.

### Outcomes with segmentectomy versus lobectomy in patients with clinical T1cN0M0 non-small cell lung cancer [^11562VRC]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We hypothesize that segmentectomy is associated with similar recurrence-free and overall survival when compared with lobectomy in the setting of patients with clinical T1cN0M0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; > 2–3 cm), as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition staging system.

Methods

We performed a single-institution retrospective study identifying patients undergoing segmentectomy (90) versus lobectomy (279) for T1c NSCLC from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2016. Univariate, multivariable, and propensity score-weighted analyses were performed to analyze the following endpoints: freedom from recurrence, overall survival, and time to recurrence.

Results

Patients undergoing segmentectomy were older than patients undergoing lobectomy (71.5 vs 68.8, respectively, P = 0.02). There were no differences in incidence of major complications (12.4% vs 11.7%, P = 0.85), hospital length of stay (6.2 vs 7 days, P = 0.19), and mortality at 30 (1.1% vs 1.7%, P = 1) and 90 days (2.2% vs 2.3%, P = 1). In addition, there were no statistical differences in locoregional (12.2% vs 8.6%, P = 0.408), distant (11.1% vs 13.9%, P = 0.716), or overall recurrence (23.3% vs 22.5%, P = 1), as well as 5-year freedom from recurrence (68.6% vs 75.8%, P = 0.5) or 5-year survival (57.8% vs 61.0%, P = 0.9). Propensity score-matched analysis found no differences in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.034; p = 0.764), recurrence-free survival (HR, 1.168; p = 0.1391), or time to recurrence (HR, 1.053; p = 0.7462).

Conclusions

In the setting of clinical T1cN0M0 NSCLC, anatomic segmentectomy was not associated with significant differences in recurrence-free or overall survival at 5 years. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to corroborate the expansion of the role of anatomic segmentectomy to all American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition Stage 1A NSCLC.

Non-small cell lung cancer — management when two lesions are present: It is reasonable to proceed with a resection of each lesion if an R0 (microscopically negative) resection can be obtained for each tumor and there is no N2 nodal disease, and a sublobar resection (segmentectomy or wedge) of one or both lesions may be necessary depending on pulmonary reserve; if an R0 resection cannot be achieved, then only a diagnostic biopsy of the lesions should be performed.

### Anatomical lung resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [^113rPpJx]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The critical role for anatomical lung resection — segmentectomy, lobectomy, pneumonectomy — in the treatment of Stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer is undisputed. In contrast, the primacy of surgery in the management of Stage III disease is not established. Increasingly, however, the multimodality approach to locally advanced lung cancer has gained acceptance, and the integration of surgery into the treatment algorithms for Stage III cancers, particularly N2 spread, has evolved. Herein, the important steps in this evolution are defined. The concept of induction or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by resection is emphasized, and evidence supporting surgery's therapeutic value in this schema is provided. Our center's strategy for the successful and safe delivery of trimodality care is comprehensively outlined.

### Choice of surgical procedure for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ≤ 1 CM or > 1 to 2 CM among lobectomy, segmentectomy, and wedge resection: a population-based study [^111NgZhz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

According to the lung cancer staging project, T1a (≤ 2 cm) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should be additionally classified into ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm groups. This study aimed to investigate the surgical procedure for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm.

Methods

We identified 15,760 patients with T1aN0M0 NSCLC after surgery from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) were compared among patients after lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection. The proportional hazards model was applied to evaluate multiple prognostic factors.

Results

OS and LCSS favored lobectomy compared with segmentectomy or wedge resection in patients with NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. Multivariable analysis showed that segmentectomy and wedge resection were independently associated with poorer OS and LCSS than lobectomy for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. With sublobar resection, lower OS and LCSS emerged for NSCLC > 1 to 2 cm after wedge resection, whereas similar survivals were observed for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm. Multivariable analyses showed that wedge resection is an independent risk factor of survival for NSCLC > 1 to 2 cm but not for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm.

Conclusion

Lobectomy showed better survival than sublobar resection for patients with NSCLC ≤ 1 cm and > 1 to 2 cm. For patients in whom lobectomy is unsuitable, segmentectomy should be recommended for NSCLC > 1 to 2 cm, whereas surgeons could rely on surgical skills and the patient profile to decide between segmentectomy and wedge resection for NSCLC ≤ 1 cm.

### Open thoracotomy versus VATS versus RATS for segmentectomy: a systematic review&Bayesian network meta-analysis [^112n6dyN]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis compares open versus VATS versus RATS segmentectomies based on 11 studies with 7280 patients. The key findings are as follows: (i) RATS is associated with a significantly higher rate of readmission compared to VATS and open thoracotomy; (ii) VATS is associated with a lower incidence of post-operative pneumonia relative to open thoracotomy; (iii) All other modalities, including 30-day mortality, show no significant differences between the three approaches.

For lung cancer resection, the first robotic approach was described in 2001 for a robotic assisted lobectomy. Since the application of RATS in centres across the world, surgeons are now able to operate without being in the same room as the patient. RATS approach for lobectomy and segmentectomy has shown to have a shorter operating time, shorter hospital stays, reduced scarring, and some authors report a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared to open thoracotomy.

By resecting less of the healthy tissue, lung segmentectomy offers better pulmonary function preservation compared to lobectomy or pneumonectomy surgical resections. These are especially recommended for patients with minimal lung reserves, while not compromising the rate of malignancy recurrence as do wedge resections if performed for lung cancer. Since having first been reported in 1939, segmentectomy surgery is now commonly performed for cases of tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and congenital lung malformations. Pulmonary resection for malignant lesions through segmentectomy has increased in popularity with recent technological advances and refined surgical techniques, allowing for both increased precision and outcomes of the segmentectomy technique, as well as earlier detection of malignancy, thus enabling a greater proportion of tumours to be small enough for parenchymal-sparing segmentectomy resection. While lobectomy is still standard care for most malignant lesions, segmentectomy surgery can be performed for early-stage lung cancer, especially if these patients have impaired lung function. This has been further reinforced with the recent CALGB 140503 and JCOG 0802 trials. These declare sub-lobar resections as non-inferior to lobectomy for small-sized non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), defining sub-lobar resections as the new standard of care for peripheral, non-metastatic, < 2 cm NSCLC. Considering the increasing opportunities and indications for sub-lobar resections, the necessity of determining the most optimal approach for this surgical procedure is evident.

Surgical intervention for peripheral subsolid lesions (Statement 12): In patients medically suitable for and amenable to surgery, sublobar resection (wedge resection or segmentectomy) may be considered for peripheral subsolid lesions < 2 cm (COR: IIa, LOE: B: randomized). Trial data informing practice include JCOG0802/WJOG4607L in peripheral non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 2 cm, where the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 94.3% for segmentectomy and 91.1% for lobectomy; Cox regression showed noninferiority and superiority for segmentectomy (hazard ratio, 0.663; 95% confidence interval, 0.474–0.927; one-sided P < .0001 for noninferiority), and 5-year relapse-free survival was 88.0% for segmentectomy and 87.9% for lobectomy, with inclusion requiring consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) > 0.5. In CALGB 140503, patients with peripheral NSCLC ≤ 2 cm were randomized to sublobar resection versus lobectomy, wedge resections were included, and the 5-year OS was 80.3% for sublobar resection and 78.9% for lobectomy.

### Meta-analysis of segmentectomy versus lobectomy for radiologically pure solid or solid-dominant stage IA non-small cell lung cancer [^111spnea]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Whether segmentectomy can be used to treat radiologically determined pure solid or solid-dominant lung cancer remains controversial owing to the invasive pathologic characteristics of these tumors despite their small size. This meta-analysis compared the oncologic outcomes after lobectomy and segmentectomy regarding relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with radiologically determined pure solid or solid-dominant clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

A literature search was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases for information from the date of database inception to March 2019. Studies were selected according to predefined eligibility criteria. The hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted or calculated as the outcome measure for data combining.

Results

Seven eligible studies published between 2014 and 2018 enrolling 1428 patients were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with lobectomy, segmentectomy had a significant benefit on the RFS of radiologically determined pure solid or solid-dominant clinical stage IA NSCLC patients (combined HR: 1.46; 95% CI, 1.05–2.03; P = 0.024) and there were no significant differences on the OS of these patients (HR: 1.52; 95% CI, 0.95–2.43; P = 0.08).

Conclusions

Segmentectomy leads to lower survival than lobectomy for clinical stage IA NSCLC patients with radiologically determined pure solid or solid-dominant tumors. Moreover, applying lobectomy to clinical stage IA NSCLC patients with radiologically determined pure solid or solid-dominant tumors (≤ 2 cm) could lead to an even bigger survival advantage. However, there are some limitations in the present study, and more evidence is needed to support the conclusion.

### Segmentectomy as a safe and equally effective surgical option under complete video-assisted thoracic surgery for patients of stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^111bbnyY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The limitations of this study lie in the retrospective nature of the study where the selection of patients was not random and patient selection bias is likely. As a consequence, the inherent differences in the tumor size and follow-up period between VATS segmentectomy and VATS lobectomy are difficult to address objectively. Relatively short follow up periods and thus small number of recurrences and mortalities may reduce the power to detect difference if any between the two procedures. We plan to continue to closely follow up on these patients.

### Physiologic evaluation of the patient with lung cancer being considered for resectional surgery: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1168oDTG]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Predicted postoperative (PPO) pulmonary function — calculation and thresholds for lung cancer resection — uses the lobectomy anatomic method "PPO FEV₁ = preoperative FEV₁ × (1 − [y/z])"; preoperative FEV₁ is the best measured postbronchodilator value, and the total number of segments for both lungs is 19 (10 in the right lung; three in the upper, two in the middle, five in the lower) and nine in the left lung (five in the upper and four in the lower). In a study of > 1,400 lung resections, the odds of postoperative respiratory complications increased as PPO FEV1 and PPO DLCO decreased, with a 10% increase in risk for every 5% decrement in PPO lung function. Prior guidance recommended estimation of PPO pulmonary function for all patients with an abnormal FEV1 (< 60% predicted), and historically operative risk has been considered acceptable for subjects with a PPO FEV1 and PPO DLCO > 40% predicted; for those who do not meet these criteria, recommendations included either assessment of exercise capacity or consideration for alternate and/or limited therapies.

### When a segmentectomy is not a segmentectomy: quality assurance audit and evaluation of required elements for an anatomic segmentectomy [^115qhEFC]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The advent of lung cancer screening and detection of smaller nodules amplifies the need to clarify the oncological quality of sublobar resections. Furthermore, studies comparing sublobar resections to lobectomies offer conflicting conclusions. We hypothesize that this is driven, in part, by inconsistency in reporting; that is, variable interpretation of what constitutes an operative segment. Without an established standard, 2 very different operations may be reported as segmental resections, leaving the data on sublobar approaches subject to interpretative variability.

Methods

A retrospective audit was performed on all segmental resections from May 2016 to December 2019 at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Pathology and operative reports were reviewed, with particular attention to the dissection of the component artery, vein, and bronchus. Resections with dissection and division of at least 1 major vascular structure (the segmental artery or vein), as well as the segmental bronchus, met operative criteria for anatomic segmentectomy. Surgical quality metrics were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

There were 271 segmental resections: 219 (80.8%) were anatomic segmentectomies and 52 (19.2%) were nonanatomic segmentectomies. For the entire cohort, nonanatomic segmentectomies had smaller margins (1.0 vs 1.5 cm; p = 0.02), fewer lymph nodes (2.0 vs 6.0; P < .001), and fewer mediastinal lymph node stations sampled (1.0 vs 2.0; P < .001). Similarly, there were smaller margins (1.5 vs 1.8 cm; p = 0.03), fewer lymph nodes (2.0 vs 6.0; P < .001), and fewer mediastinal lymph node stations sampled (1.0 vs 2.0; P < .001) in nonanatomic segmentectomies for non-small cell lung cancer.

Conclusions

Nearly 20% of reported segmentectomies may not meet criteria for true segmental resection. Therefore, prior studies may need further scrutiny to clarify outcomes and results. Establishing a professional standard may help mitigate ambiguity in published data on this subject.

Identification of Specimen and Nodule

The specimen is removed and carefully inspected. Confirmation of the nodule within the specimen is required. An adequate 2-cm bronchial margin is demonstrated by identifying the relationship between the bronchial stump and the nodule. There are currently no consensus guidelines for what constitutes an adequate parenchymal margin for carcinoid tumor in sublobar anatomical resections. For central tumors, the ability to obtain a negative parenchyma margin is achievable and we therefore recommend a resection margin to tumor ratio ≥ 1 when possible. For more peripheral carcinoid tumors, a negative margin including the staple line has been shown to be adequate but optimally, we would prefer a margin of at least 5 mm from the parenchymal staple line especially in cases with atypical carcinoid histology. Cases of stage I non–small cell lung cancer should adhere to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines to achieve a margin to tumor ratio > 1 (Video 12).

### Thoracoscopic segmentectomy for lung cancer [^116dTLvA]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Lobectomy has long been considered the standard procedure for early-stage lung cancer, and minimally invasive techniques have been demonstrated to be associated with superior outcomes compared with lobectomy by thoracotomy. The use of segmentectomy is under investigation for selected patients with small tumors, and the use of minimally invasive strategies is applicable as well. In this review, we analyzed studies that have compared (1) thoracoscopic segmentectomy versus the open approach, (2) thoracoscopic segmentectomy versus thoracoscopic lobectomy, and (3) thoracoscopic segmentectomy versus thoracoscopic lobectomy versus thoracoscopic wedge resection. When compared with open segmentectomy, preliminarily, thoracoscopic segmentectomy was found to have equivalent oncologic results, with shorter hospital length of stay, reduced rates of morbidity, and lower cost. When compared with thoracoscopic lobectomy, thoracoscopic segmentectomy had equivalent rates of morbidity, recurrence, and survival. Preliminarily, thoracoscopic segmentectomy was found to result in greater preservation of lung function and exercise capacity than the thoracoscopic lobectomy.

### Anatomic segmentectomy for the solitary pulmonary nodule and early-stage lung cancer [^116R5CXA]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anatomic segmentectomy is a versatile sublobar resection approach that can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in the setting of the indeterminate pulmonary nodule (IPN), metastasectomy, as well as small, peripheral cancers. We analyzed the clinical indications and perioperative outcomes after anatomic segmentectomy and explored its utility in the diagnosis and treatment of IPNs and small stage IA lung cancers.

Methods

This study is a retrospective review of 785 consecutive patients undergoing anatomic segmentectomy from 2002 to 2010. Primary outcome variables include perioperative course, morbidity, mortality, recurrence patterns, and survival.

Results

Surgical indications included IPN (62.4%), known lung cancer (27.6%), suspected metastasis (4.1%), bullous disease (3.7%), or other (2.2%). Video-assisted thoracic surgery was employed in 468 (59.6%) and open thoracotomy in 317 (40.4%) patients. Median length of stay was 6 days. Overall complication rate was 34.9%. Thirty-day mortality was 1.1%. Among 490 patients with an IPN, 381 (77.7%) were found to have lung cancer, 41 (8.4%) metastatic cancer, and 68 (13.9%) benign disease. Among patients with pathologic stage IA lung cancer, there was no difference in recurrence rates (14.5% vs 13.9%) or 5-year freedom from recurrence estimates (78% in each group, p = 0.738) when comparing segmentectomy and lobectomy.

Conclusions

Anatomic segmentectomy provides acceptable morbidity and mortality when approaching the IPN. Cancer is identified in 86% of lesions. Complete surgical resection can be achieved with generous parenchymal margins and thorough nodal staging for small, peripheral stage IA non-small cell lung cancer. The use of anatomic segmentectomy should be considered in this era of competing image-guided diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to peripheral lung pathology.

### Definition and assessment of high risk in patients considered for lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer: the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert panel consensus document [^113yn5ZW]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

High-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) for pulmonary risk in non–small cell lung cancer lobectomy candidates — HRCT-derived measures correlate with spirometry and may clarify risk in emphysema. Regression-based forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) derived from HRCT data correlated with physiologically measured FVC and FEV1 suggesting that HRCT imaging could be used to estimate preoperative pulmonary function in patients unable to perform spirometry. Postoperative pulmonary morbidity has been reported to be greater in patients who undergo lobectomy or segmentectomy with larger volumes of emphysema and patients with lower lung density measured using preoperative HRCT. Additionally, using the standard calculation of postoperative FEV1 might be misleading in patients with concomitant emphysema; in one series, anatomic lobectomy was performed in 14 patients with a postoperative predicted FEV1 < 40% whose emphysematous target lobe received < 10% of overall perfusion, and no significant reduction in postoperative FEV1 was observed 3 months after lobectomy.

### Segmentectomy for ground-glass-dominant lung cancer with a tumour diameter of 3 CM or less including ground-glass opacity (JCOG1211): a multicentre, single-arm, confirmatory, phase 3 trial [^114SZwLw]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Although segmentectomy is a widely used surgical procedure, lobectomy is the standard procedure for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of segmentectomy for NSCLC up to 3 cm in size, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and predominant GGO.

Methods

A multicentre, single-arm, confirmatory phase 3 trial was conducted across 42 institutions (hospitals, university hospitals, and cancer centres) in Japan. Segmentectomy with hilar, interlobar, and intrapulmonary lymph node dissection was performed as protocol surgery for patients with a tumour diameter of up to 3 cm, including GGO and dominant GGO. Eligible patients were those aged 20–79 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1 and clinical stage IA tumour confirmed by thin-sliced CT. The primary endpoint was 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS). This study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials (UMIN000011819), and is ongoing.

Findings

A total of 396 patients were registered from Sept 20, 2013, to Nov 13, 2015, of whom 357 underwent segmentectomy. At a median follow-up of 5·4 years (IQR 5·0–6·0), the 5-year RFS was 98·0% (95% CI 95·9–99·1). This finding exceeded the 87% of the pre-set threshold 5-year RFS and the primary endpoint was met. Grade 3 or 4 early postoperative complications occurred in seven patients (2%), but no grade 5 treatment-related deaths occurred.

Interpretation

Segmentectomy should be considered as part of standard treatment for patients with predominantly GGO NSCLC with a tumour size of 3 cm or less in diameter, including GGO even if it exceeds 2 cm.

Sublobar resection — segmentectomy and wedge resection should be strongly considered for peripheral T1ab, N0 tumors, and should achieve parenchymal resection margins ≥ 2 cm; sublobar resection should also sample appropriate N1 and N2 lymph node stations unless not technically feasible without substantially increasing the surgical risk. Segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection is appropriate in selected patients with poor pulmonary reserve or other major comorbidity that contraindicates lobectomy. Minimally invasive surgery (VATS or robotic-assisted approaches) should be strongly considered for patients with no anatomic or surgical contraindications, as long as there is no compromise of standard oncologic and dissection principles of thoracic surgery, and robotic surgery should only be initiated by surgeons who have completed and maintained proficiency in the technique. In high-volume centers with significant VATS experience, VATS lobectomy in selected patients results in improved early outcomes (ie, decreased pain, reduced hospital length of stay, more rapid return to function, fewer complications) without compromise of cancer outcomes, and studies of robotic-assisted pulmonary resection show non-inferiority to traditional VATS approaches when performed by experienced robotic surgeons. Lung-sparing anatomic resection (sleeve lobectomy) is preferred over pneumonectomy if anatomically appropriate and margin-negative resection is achieved. T3 (invasion) and T4 local invasion tumors require en-bloc resection of the involved structure with negative margins, and if a surgeon or center is uncertain about potential complete resection, consider obtaining an additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Regarding medical management for non-small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early-stage disease, surgery, technique, ACCP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing sublobar resection (segmentectomy or wedge resection) over lobectomy in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC considered high risk for lobectomy.

### Parenchymal preserving anatomic resections result in less pulmonary function loss in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^113A9BHZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Arguments over the extent of parenchymal resection for the small peripheral lung cancer have been waged since the earliest attempts at surgical management of this disease. The primary concern of oncologic adequacy of resection between sublobar resection and lobectomy or pneumonectomy has always been the primary point of contention. However, preservation of vital pulmonary function has also been a major consideration in choosing less than lobectomy for the small peripheral lung cancer. There are conflicting reports in the surgical literature related to the utility of sublobar resection, particularly anatomic segmentectomy, in preserving precious lung function compared to lobectomy for early stage lung cancer. These conflicting reported outcomes led us to retrospectively review our experience with anatomic segmentectomy and lobectomy for disease-free, stage I peripheral NSCLC patients to assess the long-term impact of resection on pulmonary function.

### Advances in imaging to aid segmentectomy for lung cancer [^1147BsBn]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary segmentectomy has become a widely accepted technique for resection of early-stage lung cancers. Intraoperative identification of small nodules within the lung parenchyma and definition of segmental anatomy are essential for oncologic segmental resection and significantly enhanced by recent advances in imaging techniques. Advances in imaging for nodule localization, using preoperative markers and three-dimensional computed tomography, delineation of segmental anatomy, and sentinel lymph node mapping have become important components of planning and performing minimally invasive anatomic segmentectomies and are particularly well suited for the evolving robotic-assisted platform.

### Survival outcomes of segmentectomy and lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QrCRU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Most trials demonstrating the superiority of lobectomy were not fully randomized and did not account for other variables that may affect survival. The lymph node yield with anatomical segmentectomy, a minimally invasive procedure, is notably lower compared to lobectomy. This disparity could stem from differences in the number of inter-segmental and intra-segmental lymph nodes extracted, as well as the preference for lymph node sampling over lymph node dissection during anatomical segmentectomy. The extent of lymph node dissection serves as a prognostic factor in the surgical management of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, a finding that holds significance in segmentectomy as well. Evaluation of the SEER database by Qu et al revealed that differences in survival between segmentectomy and lobectomy dissipated after stratifying patients based on the extent of lymph node dissection. Notably, this systematic lymph node dissection is not feasible in nonoperative modalities such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, highlighting a distinct advantage of surgical treatment. Tumor histology stands as another determinant of lung cancer prognosis.

In discussions concerning the role of segmentectomy, consideration of the consolidation-to-tumor ratio (C/T ratio) is warranted. Tumors with a higher C/T ratio have been demonstrated to exhibit greater invasiveness, and consequently, limited resection yields inferior overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to noninvasive tumors. Furthermore, a higher C/T ratio serves as an independent risk factor for local-regional RFS, rendering such tumors unsuitable for limited resection.

It should be noted that this review has some limitations, including a reliance on retrospective studies and potential bias that may influence the results. The results of the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective nature of most studies and heterogeneity between studies. Further evidence, particularly from prospective randomized controlled trials, is needed to definitively compare the survival outcomes of segmentectomy and lobectomy in treating early NSCLC.

### Comparison of the oncologic outcomes of anatomic segmentectomy and lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^112NsGcq]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Interest has been renewed in segmentectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, whether the oncologic outcomes are comparable with lobectomy is conflicting. To assess the evidence base, a systematic search identified 31 comparative studies for meta-analysis. No higher local or distant recurrence in segmentectomy compared with lobectomy. Nevertheless, worse outcomes in overall and recurrence-free survival for patients treated with segmentectomy were found. Lobectomy conferred a significant survival advantage compared with segmentectomy for stage I. However, segmentectomy was more suitable for stage IA NSCLC, with survivals equivalent to lobectomy. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the results.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^117JmU5a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer — anatomic resection and sublobar criteria are described as follows: Lung-sparing anatomic resection (sleeve lobectomy) is "preferred over pneumonectomy" when anatomically appropriate and margin-negative resection can be achieved, and "lobectomy or pneumonectomy should be done if physiologically feasible". Sublobar resection — segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection — "is appropriate in select patients" who are not eligible for lobectomy and for those "with a peripheral nodule 2 cm or less with low-risk features". For sublobar resections, margins "should" be "2 cm or more" or at least the nodule size, and "Resection (including wedge resection) is preferred over ablation" with the note that "Wide wedge resection may improve outcomes".

### Segmentectomy for lung cancer [^1116Y8ji]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Experience reported in the literature increasingly supports the notion that segmentectomy is comparable with lobectomy for small tumors (≤ 2 cm), provided that the lesion is located centrally and affords a 2-cm parenchymal surgical margin. In a recent retrospective study that compared video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy to VATS segmentectomy, the authors concluded that segmentectomy yields excellent oncological results with comparable morbidity, mortality, locoregional recurrence, and 3-year survival. Moreover, patients in both surgical groups were discharged after similar length hospital stays although patients undergoing VATS segmentectomy had worse pulmonary function before surgery. Perceived difficulties with new applications of minimally invasive surgeries disappear as experience increases, permitting application to technically more challenging operations. A technical description of VATS segmentectomy is provided, including 2 new methods for ensuring the exact delineation of the fissure.

### Recurrence and survival after segmentectomy in patients with prior lung resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^117WArMt]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lobectomy is the standard of care for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the treatment of choice for patients with prior lung resection and a second primary NSCLC has not been established. We compared rates and patterns of recurrence and survival in patients with and without prior lung resection treated by segmentectomy and determined predictors of recurrence.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of 90 patients who underwent 91 consecutive segmentectomies for early-stage NSCLC between April 2004 and December 2014. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of recurrence, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to determine survival.

Results

Of the 91 segmentectomies, 21 (23%) had a prior lung cancer resection and 70 (77%) were primary resections. There were 18 recurrences (20%): 9 of 21 (43%) in those with prior lung resection and 9 of 70 (13%) in those without. The 90-day mortality was 0%. The recurrence-free survival and 5-year survival were 61% and 55% in those with prior lung resection (p = 0.09) and 84% and 65% in those without (p = 0.4). Close parenchymal margin and number of lymph nodes examined were significant modifiable predictors of recurrence.

Conclusions

Segmentectomy is a reasonable option for patients with early-stage NSCLC who have had a prior lung resection. It results in similar survival but trends toward lower recurrence-free survival compared with patients undergoing primary resection.

### Sublobar resection in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma [^114Qp2FQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Though lobectomy remains the standard of care for resection of nonsmall cell lung cancer, a number of studies have been published in the last 24 months exploring the role of sublobar resection in the treatment of stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer.

Recent Findings

Large retrospective studies comparing lobar and sublobar resection show similar overall and disease-free survival. Survival and local control for sublobar resections are best for tumors smaller than 2 cm and with margins greater than 2 cm. Importantly, sublobar resections commonly have less thorough nodal dissection and incomplete pathologic staging; this may have important therapeutic consequences. No formal comparison of segmentectomy to wedge resection has been performed although bias towards segmentectomy resulting in better outcomes than nonanatomic wedge resection continues. Sublobar resection is especially interesting for patients with prior resection, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and the elderly. Radiologic criteria for selecting candidates appropriate for sublobar resection are evolving.

Summary

Sublobar resection is an alternative therapy for stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer for patients with physiologic impairment unable to undergo lobectomy. The literature also suggests a role for patients with prior lung resection, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, peripheral tumors less than 2 cm, and for the elderly.

### Role of segmentectomy in treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^114r5KBE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose and Design

Standard treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer has traditionally involved lobectomy. Historical data that demonstrates suboptimal results for sublobar resection compared to lobectomy have been challenged in recent years with retrospective data for patients with T1a disease. For patients who are not candidates for lobectomy, options for sublobar resection include wedge resection or anatomic segmentectomy. Segmentectomy has long been held to be a better cancer operation than wedge resection, and its role in treating early-stage lung cancer remains controversial in patients who are candidates for lobectomy. A review of available literature involving segmentectomy and possible predictors of failure for segmentectomy was performed in an attempt to clarify the role of segmentectomy for early-stage lung cancer.

Results and Conclusions

Current evidence is conflicting regarding the optimal scenario for sublobar resection with segmentectomy. Two large-scale randomized trials are currently addressing the question. In the meantime, certain preoperative and intraoperative considerations should be taken into account when considering segmentectomy for the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

Risk thresholds for curative-intent lung cancer surgery — risks related to standard surgical resection include perioperative morbidity and mortality and long-term functional disability; patient preference as to the maximal acceptable surgical risk should also be explored; the use of minimally invasive thoracic surgery and sublobar anatomic resections (segmentectomy), whenever technically and oncologically feasible, needs to be taken into account, as both techniques have been shown to substantially reduce the perioperative risk and the physiologic impact and to provide comparable or even superior oncologic results; the responsible physician should also keep in mind and discuss nonsurgical treatment alternatives, such as conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation, if the risk of surgery is deemed unacceptably high by both surgeon and patient.

Regardless of whether patients undergo wedge or segmentectomy, adequate margins should be achieved, and sublobar resection should involve an anatomic segmentectomy whenever possible.

Central Message

Anatomical segmentectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection should be standard surgery for NSCLC ≤ 2 cm with a C/T ratio > 0.5, ie, solid predominant features, on HRCT images.

See Article page.

One definitive answer to the clinical question as to whether patients with early-stage, non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 2 cm should be treated by segmentectomy or lobectomy has transpired from a prospective randomized trial conducted by the Japanese Clinical Oncology Group 0802 (JCOG0802)/West Japan Oncology Group 4607L (WJOG4607L). The results of this clinical trial indicated that radical anatomical segmentectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection should be the standard surgical procedure for peripherally located NSCLC ≤ 2 cm with a consolidation to tumor ratio > 0.5, eg, solid predominant features on high-resolution computed tomography images. Moreover, the ongoing JCOG1211 and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 140503 trial will disclose additional information about segmentectomy for patients with early-stage NSCLCs. Thus, segmentectomy is a key surgical procedure that general thoracic surgeons will need to master as the frequency of detecting small NSCLC continues to increase.
