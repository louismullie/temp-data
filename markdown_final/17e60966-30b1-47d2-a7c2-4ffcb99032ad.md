## Question

Do patients with allergy to sunflower typically react to sunflower oil

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with sunflower allergy typically react to sunflower oil. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and mechanism of a sunflower seed IgE-mediated allergy versus contact or pollen-related issues. Then, I should review how oil processing alters protein content and allergenicity. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence for reactions to refined versus unrefined sunflower oil. After that, I need to stratify risk for different patient phenotypes, and finally, I will translate this into practical, patient-centered recommendations with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I don't mix mechanisms. We're discussing IgE-mediated reactions to sunflower seed proteins with ingestion, which is distinct from contact dermatitis to Compositae sesquiterpene lactones and distinct from pollen-food syndrome due to aeroallergen cross-reactivity; I need to keep those entities separate to avoid misattributing risk from one mechanism to another, especially since contact allergens and inhalant cross-reactivity don't predict ingestion reactions to seed oils in a straightforward way [^113rVHF6] [^114osWi7] [^113tMoRi].

> Next, I should review what is actually in sunflower oil; wait, let me verify the impact of refining on residual proteins. A classic JACI study measured a marked drop in total protein from crude pressed oil to fully refined oil (about 13.6 µg/mL down to 0.22 µg/mL, approximately a 98% reduction), yet trace bands including a predominant 67-kDa protein persisted and were IgE-reactive in an oil-sensitized patient, indicating that refined oil can still contain allergenic protein at very low levels [^notfound]. Mechanistically, I should consider that lipophilic seed proteins such as oleosins can survive processing and are underrepresented in aqueous diagnostic extracts, supporting a plausible route for rare oil-mediated reactions in highly sensitized individuals [^1177Ntz9] [^113aZaSi].

> I will now examine clinical evidence of reactivity to oil, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single study. The 2000 JACI paper concluded refined sunflower oil may pose a threat to people highly sensitized to sunflower seeds, but the data were limited to protein analyses and immunoblotting with one patient serum; large-scale ingestion studies are lacking, so population risk remains uncertain despite biological plausibility [^1123Eqk5]. To contextualize severity of seed allergy itself, a recent pediatric cohort of 235 children with sunflower seed allergy reported about one quarter met criteria for anaphylaxis to seed ingestion, underscoring that seed allergy can be severe even if oil-specific outcomes were not systematically recorded [^116hbYxu]. A broader review of edible seed hypersensitivity also notes that data for seed oils are sparse and often limited to case reports, which tempers any strong inferences about typical oil reactivity rates [^notfound].

> But wait, what if we're conflating topical safety with oral safety; I need to check the dermatology literature. Contemporary patch-testing work in more than 500 patients, including those with nickel and Compositae allergy, shows no contact sensitization to refined sunflower oil, supporting overall topical safety, yet that does not answer the ingestion question given different immune pathways and exposure doses; I should be careful not to extrapolate cutaneous tolerance to oral tolerance [^115idnUz] [^1123Eqk5]. Therefore, the absence of contact sensitization does not negate the possibility of rare ingestion reactions in highly sensitized seed-allergic patients, especially with unrefined oils that carry higher residual protein burdens [^1123Eqk5].

> Let me think about what is "typical". Most commercially available culinary sunflower oil is highly refined, with protein content reduced to trace levels that are generally below thresholds that trigger reactions for the majority of seed-allergic patients; thus, typical clinical experience is that refined sunflower oil is tolerated by most sunflower seed–allergic individuals, whereas unrefined, cold-pressed, or "virgin" oils carry a higher theoretical risk due to greater protein content [^1123Eqk5] [^112zv8Aq]. However, I should confirm that my conclusion aligns with the principle that some patients react to very low doses; severe reactions can occur at a range of exposure levels, so I must avoid declaring zero risk, particularly for those with a history suggestive of reactions to trace exposures [^115yTvJw] [^116j6Ehv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost tried to assign numeric risk percentages, but I should double-check whether such figures are evidence-based. The dose–severity relationship is highly variable, and meta-analytic data show that severe reactions can occur across exposure levels with considerable interindividual variability; therefore, I will avoid unvalidated quantitative risk estimates for oil tolerance and instead emphasize individualized risk assessment based on history, phenotype, and controlled testing where appropriate [^116j6Ehv] [^115yTvJw].

> Next, I should review diagnostic and management tools. A detailed, allergy-focused history remains the first step, including form of oil exposure and any prior tolerance to refined oils; when uncertainty persists and the result would change management, a supervised oral food challenge to the specific refined oil can resolve ambiguity, given the limitations of standard extracts for lipophilic allergens; BAT can be considered in specialized centers to support clinical relevance when multiple cross-reactivities or lipophilic proteins are suspected [^113rVHF6] [^114dYJZn] [^114y7MUx]. I initially thought about ordering component-resolved diagnostics for a "67-kDa sunflower oil allergen", but hold on, I should verify availability; such targeted sunflower oil components are not validated or routinely available, so that earlier impulse needs correction in favor of challenge-based confirmation when safe and indicated [^112zv8Aq] [^113rVHF6].

> I need to ensure management advice distinguishes refined from unrefined products and aligns with food allergy safety principles. For most sunflower seed–allergic patients, continued consumption of highly refined sunflower oil can be reasonable if there is a documented history of tolerance or a negative supervised challenge; by contrast, those with prior anaphylaxis to sunflower seed or reactions to trace exposures should strictly avoid cold-pressed or unrefined oils and consider a supervised challenge to refined oil only if the dietary impact justifies the risk; prescribing or maintaining an epinephrine autoinjector is appropriate for patients with a history of anaphylaxis or those at nontrivial risk where avoidance cannot be guaranteed [^112RATHC] [^1123Eqk5] [^115FckNG].

> Let me reconsider labeling and patient counseling, and I should confirm the evidence gaps. Terms like "high-oleic" refer to fatty acid composition rather than protein content and generally still reflect refined products, but since explicit protein thresholds are rarely disclosed on labels, counseling should acknowledge uncertainty and rely on the refining status of the oil; if manufacturing is unclear, shared decision-making and, when needed, a supervised challenge offer a safer path than blanket avoidance for all patients [^1123Eqk5] [^112zv8Aq]. I should confirm patients understand that topical tolerance to refined sunflower oil in cosmetics does not guarantee oral tolerance, given different exposure routes and mechanisms, to avoid false reassurance from dermatologic data alone [^115idnUz].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Typical reactions to refined sunflower oil among sunflower seed–allergic patients are uncommon because modern refining markedly reduces residual protein, but rare reactions remain biologically plausible, especially in highly sensitized individuals and with unrefined oils; therefore, a nuanced, history-driven approach with consideration of supervised oral challenge is appropriate, while maintaining strict avoidance of unrefined oils in higher-risk patients and ensuring emergency preparedness where indicated [^1123Eqk5] [^116hbYxu] [^112RATHC].

Most patients with sunflower seed allergy **do not react to highly refined sunflower oil** because refining removes proteins to below detectable levels [^notfound]. Rare reactions have been reported to **minimally processed or cold-pressed oils** that retain protein [^1123Eqk5], so these should be avoided by sunflower-allergic patients [^112RATHC]. Highly refined sunflower oil is generally safe, but patients with severe allergy should use caution and consult their allergist.

---

## Allergenic proteins in sunflower seeds

Sunflower seed allergy is typically mediated by **IgE antibodies** against seed proteins, including storage proteins (2S albumins, 7S vicilins, 11S legumins) [^112Lim17] and oleosins [^113aZaSi], which are heat- and digestion-stable and can cause severe reactions [^112zv8Aq]. These proteins occur in seeds and minimally processed oils but are largely removed during refining [^1123Eqk5].

---

## Protein content in sunflower oil

The refining process (degumming, neutralization, bleaching, deodorization) **reduces protein levels** from ~13.6 µg/mL in crude oil to ~0.22 µg/mL in refined oil, often to below detection limits. Highly refined oils therefore contain negligible protein and are unlikely to trigger reactions in most sunflower-allergic patients.

---

## Clinical evidence of allergic reactions to sunflower oil

Allergic reactions to sunflower oil **are rare** and usually linked to minimally processed or cold-pressed oils that retain protein [^112zv8Aq]. Highly refined oils are generally safe [^111YB3ng]; however, rare reactions have been reported in highly sensitized individuals [^1123Eqk5].

---

## Diagnostic methods for sunflower oil allergy

Diagnosis is based on clinical history, skin prick testing, serum-specific IgE, and oral food challenges [^111U1tmh] [^1179ybNF]. Skin prick testing and serum IgE can detect sensitization to sunflower proteins, but **oral food challenges are the gold standard** for confirming clinical reactivity.

---

## Cross-reactivity with other allergens

Cross-reactivity can occur between sunflower proteins and other seeds or plant foods due to homologous proteins such as **2S albumins and oleosins** [^112Lim17] [^113aZaSi]. However, refined sunflower oil contains minimal protein; therefore, cross-reactivity is unlikely unless the oil is minimally processed [^111YB3ng].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with confirmed sunflower seed allergy **avoid minimally processed or cold-pressed sunflower oils**, as these may retain allergenic proteins [^112RATHC] [^113qBGWX]. Highly refined sunflower oil is generally considered safe [^111YB3ng]; however, patients with severe allergy should consult their allergist before consumption [^1123Eqk5].

## Summary of evidence

| **Factor** | **Highly refined sunflower oil** | **Minimally processed sunflower oil** |
|-|-|-|
| Protein content | Negligible (< 0.22 µg/mL) [^1123Eqk5] | Higher (~13.6 µg/mL) [^1123Eqk5] |
| Allergenic potential | Low [^111YB3ng] | High [^112zv8Aq] |
| Clinical reactions | Rare | More common [^112zv8Aq] |
| Recommended for sunflower-allergic patients | Generally safe | Avoid [^112RATHC] |

---

Highly refined sunflower oil is **generally safe** for sunflower-allergic patients because it contains **negligible protein** [^111YB3ng]. Minimally processed or cold-pressed oils should be avoided due to higher protein content [^112zv8Aq]. Patients with severe allergy should consult their allergist before consuming any sunflower oil [^113rVHF6].

### Influence of refining steps on trace allergenic protein content in sunflower oil [^1123Eqk5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Although allergy to sunflower seed and oil is relatively rare, several cases of sunflower seed allergy have been observed. We have already described one case of anaphylaxis after eating sunflower oil and margarine.

- **Objective**: The aim of our study was to determine and characterize the allergens from sunflower oil at the different steps of the refining process: crude pressed oil (step A), acidification and neutralization (step B), pregumming by centrifugation (step C), washing (step D), bleaching (step E), gumming by filtration (step F), and deodorization (step G).

- **Methods**: A sample of oil from each step of the process (steps A to G) was heat extracted with PBS. The protein concentration of each extract was evaluated using the micro-Bradford assay. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE. The immunoblot was performed with the serum of a patient sensitized to sunflower seed and oil.

- **Results**: The extracts obtained after each step reveal a decrease in total protein concentration from 13.6 microg/mL to 0.22 microg/mL. The result of SDS-PAGE shows 5 bands, from 67 kD to 145 kD, with the most abundant being the 67-kD protein. The amount of this protein decreases after each step of the process. However, it is still present in trace amounts in the refined oil. The 67-kD protein, which is mainly present in the crude oil and slightly in the refined oil, has been shown to be allergenic.

- **Conclusion**: Because of the presence of allergenic proteins, refined sunflower oil may pose a threat to people highly sensitized to sunflower seeds.

### Pollen-food syndromes associated with weed pollinosis: An update from the molecular point of view [^114osWi7]. Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

Pollinosis patients often display adverse reactions upon the ingestion of plant-derived foods as a result of immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactive structures shared by pollen and food allergen sources. The symptoms of such pollen-food syndromes (PFS) or class 2 food allergies range from local oral allergy syndrome to severe systemic anaphylaxis. Two clinical syndromes, the celery-mugwort-spice syndrome and the mugwort-mustard-allergy syndrome, have been described in association with weed pollinosis. However, other associations between weed pollinosis and hypersensitivity to certain kinds of food have also been observed, including the mugwort-peach, the ragweed-melon-banana, the plantain-melon, the pellitory-pistachio, the goosefoot-fruit, the Russian thistle-saffron, and the hop-celery association.

The number of allergen sources involved, as well as the specific allergens and influencing factors like geography, diet, and food preparation, contribute to the high clinical complexity of PFS. Known causative cross-reactive allergens include profilins, lipid transfer proteins, and high-molecular-weight allergens and/or glycoallergens. The use of nonstandardized allergen extracts poses additional problems for both diagnosis and therapy of PFS patients. Further identification and characterization of the involved allergens are essential for a better understanding of PFS and vaccine development. Panels of recombinant allergens and/or hypo-allergens are promising tools to improve both PFS diagnostics and therapy.

### Genome-wide association study reveals a causal relationship between allergic rhinitis and hazelnut allergy [^11148jo7]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of FA also adds to the complexity. In addition to directly triggering allergic reactions through food consumption, cross-reactivity between certain foods and inhaled aeroallergens can lead to allergic reactions. The categorization of FA into primary and secondary types is based on the mechanism triggering allergic reactions: primary FA directly results from food allergens, while secondary FA (also called pollen food allergy syndrome) results from a cross-reactivity between tree/grass pollen and food allergens. Currently, it remains uncertain whether the genetic factors associated with primary and secondary FA are identical, as secondary FA is more prevalent in adults than in children.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the genetic risk factors related to likely FA as well as allergen-specific FA in a large population-based adult Dutch cohort and to assess the (causal) relation between AR and FA.

### Cross-reactive aeroallergens: Which need to cross our mind in food allergy diagnosis [^115kkHGC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Secondary food allergies due to cross-reactivity between inhalant and food allergens are a significant and increasing global health issue. Cross-reactive food allergies predominantly involve plant-derived foods resulting from a prior sensitization to cross-reactive components present in pollen (grass, tree, weeds) and natural rubber latex. Primary sensitization to allergens found in fungi, insects, and both nonmammalian and mammalian meat might also induce cross-reactive food allergic syndromes. Correct diagnosis of these associated food allergies is not always straightforward and can pose a difficult challenge. Cross-reactive allergens might hamper food allergy diagnosis by causing clinically irrelevant positive tests to cross-reacting foods that are safely consumed. This review summarizes the most relevant cross-reactivity syndromes between inhalant and food allergens. Particular focus is paid to the potential and limitations of confirmatory testing such as skin testing, specific IgE assays, molecular diagnosis, and the basophil activation test.

### Sensitization to sunflower pollen and lung functions in sunflower processing workers [^113L9PfB]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate whether exposure to sunflower pollen (Helianthus annuus) increases both sensitization and respiratory symptoms, and whether it affects lung functions in sunflower processing workers.

- **Methods**: The largest sunflower processing factories in the Thrace region of Turkey participated in this study. Workers from the units directly exposed to sunflower seed enrolled as the study group (n = 102), and workers who were not directly exposed to Helianthus annuus pollen (n = 102) were the control group. Detailed questionnaires covering respiratory and allergic symptoms were completed, and skin prick tests and lung function tests were performed.

- **Results**: We found a very high rate (23.5%) of sensitization to Helianthus annuus in the study group compared to the controls (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of sensitization to H. annuus was increased 4.7-fold (odds ratio = 4.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.3–16.7) if subjects were exposed to sunflower pollen in the workplace. While asthmatic symptoms and allergic skin diseases were not different between the two groups, workers in the study group had a higher rate of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis (P < 0.05). We found that pulmonary function was significantly impaired in the study group (P < 0.01). Using a multivariate analysis model, inclusion in the study group was found to be a predictive factor for impairment of lung function (P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that sunflower pollen has high allergenic potential, especially when there is close contact.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^116j6Ehv]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Dose**: The relationship between dose/level of exposure and severity is complex and unclear. For accidental reactions in the community setting, it can be very difficult to accurately determine the degree of allergen exposure associated with an event, particularly those associated with fatal outcomes. Most individuals experience mild symptoms at food challenge prior to developing more significant (and less mild) symptoms to a dose sufficient to meet challenge stopping criteria — after all, the basic premise of food challenges is the assumption that incremental dosing effectively dose-limits severity.

In a small study of 27 children reacting to peanut at food challenge, 21 had anaphylaxis but only three as initial presenting symptoms; 13 children presented with initial non-anaphylaxis symptoms but then developed anaphylaxis with further peanut ingestion. This pattern has been reproduced elsewhere, where individuals often show a dose-response between symptoms and level of allergen exposure, at least for the occurrence of any anaphylaxis, but this may not be apparent in larger datasets. In an analysis of 734 double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges from The Netherlands, dose predicted only 4.4% of the variance in reaction severity — in other words, dose was not an important factor. Within a population, there will be a mixture of different allergic phenotypes, with some individuals showing a dose-response but others not. Most datasets show that severe reactions can occur at all levels of allergen exposure, further obscuring the dose-severity relationship.

### Clinical presentations of food allergy [^1145zwnR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food allergies are immune-mediated responses to food proteins. Due to differences in the underlying immunologic mechanisms, food allergies can manifest in various clinical presentations. This article discusses the manifestations of IgE-mediated disorders, including urticaria and angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, gastrointestinal anaphylaxis, generalized anaphylaxis, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome.

- **Mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders**: This section reviews presentations such as atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.
- **Cell-mediated food allergies**: The article discusses manifestations such as dietary protein-induced proctitis and proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, celiac disease, and food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis.

### A systematic review of allergen cross-reactivity: Translating basic concepts into clinical relevance [^1153UMGi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Computational approaches for predicting allergenicity and cross-reactivity were increasingly reported, with some tools already available on the web.

- **Therapeutic advances**: Taken together, clinical evaluation of cross-reactive molecules and individual sensitization patterns affect AIT prescription, efficacy, and monitoring; they help evaluate novel approaches such as apple oral AIT for birch pollinosis and extend protection through cross-blocking reactivity.

The study of host immune cross-recognition contributed to further insight into Bet v 1 cross-reactivity at the IgG and IgE levels after allergen vaccination or AIT, and B-cell memory at mucosal allergen exposure sites. Finally, intervention-directed approaches, such as identification of apple cultivars with low clinical cross-reactivity, could be considered for birch-allergic patients with pollen-related food allergy to apple.

### Is pea our hidden allergen? An American pediatric case series [^11751VHY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

The importance of our case series lies in the fact that it highlights anaphylactic reactions to pea protein, which is typically considered safe and usually an alternative for those with other food allergies, as shown with patients 1 and 4. Our case series reiterates the need for more studies to define cross-reactivity between peas and peanuts, particularly as 3 of 6 of our patients had a concomitant peanut allergy, and a fourth patient had a concomitant legume allergy. We were not able to exclude cross-contamination in the case of patient 5, as he has a peanut allergy which could very well have caused his reaction; however, given our experience with pea allergies and his serum IgE level, it was decided not to challenge pea and opt for a safer option instead.

Our case series is too small to answer such questions, but we encourage allergists to be more mindful of pea protein as a relevant allergen and to evaluate pea allergy through skin testing or serum IgE testing if the patient presents with a concerning history. This is especially relevant in light of the popularity that pea protein is gaining. Further studies with a bigger sample size and more rigorous challenges are necessary to evaluate cross-reactivity within the legume family and, more importantly, whether the presence of a pea allergy should trigger evaluation for a peanut allergy and vice versa.

### Cosmetics and herbal remedies with Compositae plant extracts - are they tolerated by Compositae-allergic patients [^112QRWgg]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Compositae-sensitive patients are routinely warned against the topical use of Compositae-containing cosmetics and herbal remedies. However, the risk of elicitation of dermatitis in presensitized persons is unknown.

- **Objectives**: The main aim of this study was to assess the significance of direct plant allergen contact via Compositae-derived cosmetics and herbal remedies in Compositae-allergic patients, with special reference to arnica (Arnica montana) and German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita).

- **Methods**: Eight of 12 chamomile-sensitive patients tested positive to chamomile-containing preparations, including tea, creams, ointments, and oil. Five of six arnica-sensitive persons tested positive to arnica-based products.

- **Results**: When the group was patch tested with cosmetic and/or herbal product ingredients, plant allergens elicited positive reactions most frequently, but fragrances, emulsifiers, and preservatives tested positive as well. Plant allergens were mainly derived from Compositae, but avocado oil and Hamamelis virginiana tincture were unexpectedly detected as sensitizers too. Chemical analyses indicated that the Compositae allergens were both sesquiterpene lactones and other naturally occurring compounds.

- **Conclusion**: In conclusion, Compositae-allergic persons should be warned against the topical use of Compositae-containing products, not only because of the plant allergens, but also because of allergenic cream constituents that may cause reactions in patients who have multiple contact allergies besides the Compositae allergy.

### Epitope specificity determines cross-protection of a SIT-induced IgG4 antibody [^116a3ybm]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Referring to the WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature, allergens are listed according to their origin and annotated to the individual allergen sources. However, it has turned out to be useful to group allergens into families related by sequence, three-dimensional structure, and immunological cross-reactivity. This grouping is extremely useful to explain clinical syndromes based on the cross-reactivity of patients' IgE antibodies and/or T-cell receptors with structurally related allergens from different sources. For example, cross-reactivity of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 with counterparts in various plant foods is responsible for oral allergy syndrome and exacerbations of atopic eczema in birch pollen-allergic patients upon ingestion of food containing cross-reactive allergens.

Other highly cross-reactive plant allergens include profilins, which are ubiquitous cytoskeletal proteins, and polcalcins, a family of calcium-binding allergens causing clinical reactions to multiple plant pollens due to a high degree of sequence similarity. Polcalcins from grass pollen appear to be the most potent primary sensitizers. Sensitized patients show extensive cross-reactivity of their IgE antibodies with related allergens in pollens of various grasses, trees, and weeds. Although there is extensive cross-reactivity of allergic patients' IgE antibodies towards allergens from the Bet v 1, profilin, and polcalcin families, the text appears cut off and does not continue.

### Road map for the clinical application of the basophil activation test in food allergy [^114dYJZn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Do we need improved diagnostic testing for IgE-mediated food allergy?

The diagnostic performance of skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE to whole extracts can vary depending on the food sources and the quality of the allergen extracts. Allergen extracts usually contain the major and minor allergens relevant for the food's ability to elicit allergic reactions. However, allergen extracts obtained from certain food sources, such as soya, wheat, and certain nuts and seeds, may miss some important allergens (e.g. lipophilic proteins such as oleosins and other proteins lost during the production of the extracts). This can impair their diagnostic utility.

Generally, when interpreting SPT and specific IgE as positive at low limits of detection, they exhibit high sensitivity but poor specificity. Without a clinical history suggestive of allergy, the mere detection of sensitization by SPT or specific IgE leads to high false-positive rates and low positive predictive values (PPVs). When using 95% PPV value cut-offs (e.g. 8 mm for SPT to peanut and 15 kU/L for specific IgE to peanut), the specificity of these tests is enhanced but their sensitivity is reduced, resulting in many false negatives and low negative predictive value (NPV).

As a result, a large proportion of patients tested, particularly when the pre-test probability is low (e.g. no or remote history of known ingestion), have intermediate-range results for SPT and specific IgE and require oral food challenges (OFC) to clarify whether they have a food allergy.

### Characterization and incidence of sunflower seed allergy in a pediatric allergy clinic [^116hbYxu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Sunflower seeds are a popular allergen-free peanut alternative. This study aims to describe sunflower seed allergy incidence and characteristics. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with sunflower seed allergy from 1995 to 2021 in a pediatric allergy clinic. We described demographic characteristics, testing results, atopic comorbidities, and reaction histories of patients with sunflower seed allergy, and calculated the annual cumulative incidence of the allergy. Logistic regression was used to estimate the increase in odds of sunflower seed allergy diagnosis for each year from 1995 to 2021.

From 1995 to 2021, we identified 235 patients with sunflower seed allergy. Among the patients, the median age at diagnosis was 3.9 years. More than three-quarters of patients had another atopic condition. Half of the reactions consisted of mild urticaria or rash, and a quarter met criteria for anaphylaxis. The cumulative incidence ranged from 0% (1995–1999, 2001–2004, and 2006) to 0.38% (2021). From 1995 to 2021, the odds of sunflower seed allergy diagnosis increased annually by 21% (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25).

In conclusion, in our single-center cohort of children with sunflower seed allergy, most children were diagnosed in early childhood, had high rates of comorbid atopic conditions, and had high rates of cutaneous reactions to sunflower seed products. Moreover, in our cohort, the incidence of sunflower seed allergy increased.

### Nothing new under the sun? Sunflower oil shows no cross-reactivity with nickel or Compositae allergens [^111YB3ng]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). High credibility.

Despite its widespread use, sunflower oil has rarely been studied as a potential allergen. Our data show no contact sensitization in over 500 patients, including those allergic to nickel or Compositae, suggesting it is not a clinically relevant allergen.

Though sunflower is a member of the Compositae family, allergenic sesquiterpene lactones are typically confined to secretory plant structures like trichomes, found on leaves and flowers — not seeds. Solvent extracts of seeds may show trace allergen presence, but oil pressed from dehulled seeds contains only minute quantities.

Additionally, sunflower seeds rank high among nickel‐containing foods, which may prompt concern for nickel‐allergic patients. However, refined sunflower oil contains undetectable nickel levels even when derived from plants irrigated with nickel‐contaminated water. Refining removes metal residues to improve stability and product quality.

Only one case report has implicated sunflower oil in contact allergy, and the case involved a lip balm with multiple constituents. Our findings support its overall safety for topical use, even among populations sensitive to related allergens. This study is limited by its single‐centre design and use of only one commercially available sunflower oil. Broader testing across formulations would further support these findings.

### Poppy seed allergy: Molecular diagnosis and cross-reactivity with tree nuts [^111z3orL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Poppy seed (PS) can be a cause of severe allergic reactions, especially in individuals with conallergy to tree nuts and other seeds, but diagnostic criteria and sensitization patterns are lacking. The objective of the study is to assess the role of PS extract and individual allergens in diagnosing PS allergy and their cross-reactivities with tree nuts and buckwheat.

- **Methods**: Our retrospective study included 36 PS-sensitized patients; 10 with a positive and 26 with a negative oral food challenge (OFC). We identified individual PS allergens and compared the diagnostic performance of specific IgE (sIgE) to PS extract with its allergens. Cross-reactivities between PS and related allergens from other seeds were assessed by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

- **Results**: Four novel PS allergens were identified: Pap s 1 (vicilin), Pap s 1 (27–424) (α-hairpinin), Pap s 2 (legumin), and Pap s 3 (small hydrophilic seed protein). A positive OFC correlated with higher PS-sIgE levels and elevated sIgE levels for the PS allergens, except for Pap s 3. PS and α-hairpinin-sIgE effectively differentiated allergic from tolerant patients, with area under the curve values of 0.95 and 0.94. PS-sIgE > 10.00 kU A /L exhibited 90% sensitivity and 73% specificity, whereas α-hairpinin-sIgE > 2.60 kU A /L showed 100% sensitivity and 77% specificity. PS vicilin and legumin highly cross-reacted with hazelnut and buckwheat homologs, whereas α-hairpinin-sIgE cross-reacted with the related almond allergen.

- **Conclusions**: This study is the most extensive on PS allergy at the time of writing. PS and α-hairpinin-sIgE effectively differentiate between allergic and tolerant patients.

### Tree nut allergies: Allergen homology, cross-reactivity, and implications for therapy [^115rpZA3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Tree nut allergy is a potentially life-threatening disease that is increasing in prevalence, now affecting 1% of the general population in the United States. While other food allergies often resolve spontaneously, tree nut allergies are outgrown in less than 10% of cases. Due to the likelihood of cross-sensitization to multiple tree nut allergens, the treatment guideline is strict avoidance of all nuts once one tree nut allergy has been diagnosed. For example, walnut and pecan are highly cross-reactive, along with cashew and pistachio. However, the extent of clinical, IgE-mediated cross-reactivity among other tree nuts remains unclear, making avoidance of all tree nuts a safe approach.

There have been recent advances in immunotherapy for food allergies. For instance, investigational immunotherapies for milk, egg, and peanut allergies, specifically oral immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy, and epicutaneous immunotherapy, have been developed. However, there are no large randomized controlled clinical trials for tree nut allergies. Although there has been less research into tree nut allergy immunotherapies, evidence of T-cell cross-reactivity among tree nuts exists in animal models and in T cells from allergic patients, indicating that immunotherapeutic interventions may be possible. Here, we review the literature regarding epidemiology, allergen homology, and cross-reactivity among tree nuts and explore how findings can be employed for effective therapy.

### Use of "natural" oils for moisturization: Review of olive, coconut, and sunflower seed oil [^112UCYD4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of effective medications for the management of atopic dermatitis and xerosis, patients may use nonconventional therapies such as topical oils. Patients choose these treatments due to the perceived lower risk of natural products and the fear of potential adverse effects of topical steroids. This review examines the use of topical olive, coconut, and sunflower seed oil in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and xerosis, with a focus on children. Currently available evidence suggests that olive oil may exacerbate xerosis and atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to make definitive recommendations regarding the use of coconut and sunflower seed oil.

### Molecular insight into IgE-mediated reactions to sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed proteins [^113uHaWu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Food allergy is becoming a major public health concern in recent times. Several sesame seed allergenic proteins have been identified; however, sensitization toward these proteins does not follow a common and unique pattern of clinical reactivity, as shown by the differential geographic recognition of single proteins.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the sensitization profiles of 18 Italian individuals who experienced clinical symptoms after sesame seed consumption, including 4 anaphylactic reactions.

- **Methods**: Using an in vitro approach, we adopted a 2-dimensional electrophoretic technique combined with immunoblotting analyses by using sera from 18 Italian sesame-allergic patients.

- **Results**: We showed the prevalent and almost exclusive reactivity of the sesame 11S globulin. We shed light on the active role of the basic subunit of this globulin family. The limited accessibility of this polypeptide chain, unless the interchain disulphide bonds are cleaved, may be one of the reasons for its structural/functional stability and, thus, great potential for induction of IgE reactivity.

- **Conclusions**: These results confirmed previous findings on the reactivity of the basic subunit of 11S globulin in various legume species. Moreover, this experimental approach proved to be useful for the noninvasive screening of specific reactivities in sensitized patients.

### Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant-specific IgE obscures true atopy and exhibits ⍺-1,3-fucose epitope-specific inverse associations with asthma [^111qUpaJ]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, IgE to standard allergen extracts is a risk factor for, and mediator of, allergy-related diseases, including asthma, and defines "atopic" allergy-related disease phenotypes. In tropical low-income countries (LICs), allergen extract-specific IgE levels are often elevated but are rarely associated with allergy-related disease. Host immune responses to common allergen sources exhibit important parallels with responses to parasite, insect, and other environmental exposures that have related molecular targets. For example, the *Onchocerca volvulus* tropomyosin protein is structurally homologous to house dust mite (HDM) tropomyosin and can induce basophil histamine release. Some *Schistosoma mansoni* (Sm) venom allergen-like (SmVAL) proteins (with orthologues in wasps) and tegumental allergen-like (SmTAL) proteins have allergenic properties. Recognition of such phenomena has provided insights regarding epidemiological trends of allergy in the tropics.

The role of carbohydrate cross-reactivity in the epidemiology of allergic sensitization and disease is less understood. Among the most common sources of cross-reactivity between natural allergens and other environmental exposures are specific asparagine (N) linked glycan modifications found on some helminth, insect, and plant proteins (termed cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants, CCDs). The N-glycan trimannosyl-chitobiose core (Man 3 GlcNAc 2) is conserved in eukaryotes. "Classical" CCD N-glycans are expressed by invertebrate and plant proteins and on antigenic surfaces and in secretomes of schistosome.

### Low-affinity but high-avidity interactions may offer an explanation for IgE-mediated allergen cross-reactivity [^114Y3rbv]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

The graphical abstract combines the findings and extrapolates our insights for low-affinity antibodies to a defined original antigen (Fel d 1) to potential low-affinity antibodies against cross-reactive allergens. The figure indicates that cross-reactive IgE antibodies bind to the allergy-inducing allergen with high affinity and only with low affinity to the cross-reactive allergen. Upon exposure to the cross-reactive allergen, low-affinity IgE antibodies will be stabilized on the mast cell surface by the cross-reactive allergen and consequently may activate mast cells despite low affinity.

Taken together, we demonstrate here that IgE antibodies with low affinity can bind allergens with high avidity by interacting with multiple epitopes on the allergen. Thus, avidity rather than affinity drives IgE-mediated allergic reactions for low-affinity IgE antibodies. These findings may offer an explanation for the unexpected cross-reactivity between different allergens. Therefore, allergen cross-reactivity may be driven by low affinity but high-avidity interaction.

### Advances and novel developments in molecular allergology [^117DN8Lf]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Understanding cross-reactivities among allergens from various sources is crucial for designing efficient diagnostic or immunotherapy strategies. Recent studies have highlighted this issue, finding that major tree nut allergens are often highly cross-reactive. While investigating the natural Jug r 2, researchers discovered another walnut vicilin, Jug r 6, which serves as an IgE cross-reactive marker between walnut, hazelnut, pistachio, and sesame. Examining purified natural allergens is essential for detecting native post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as glycosylation, which may significantly impact IgE cross-reactivity.

Concomitant sensitization to hazelnut and peanut starts early in life, possibly dominated by T-cell epitopes of the 7S vicilins Cor a 11 and Ara h 1. Recent reviews discuss examples of nonhomologous proteins that cross-react on the IgE and T-cell levels. The structure of Can f 6 has been resolved, contributing to the understanding of its cross-reactivity with the cat allergen Fel d 4. However, conformational epitopes that selectively recognize these allergens are yet to be discovered, necessary for diagnosing genuine dog or cat sensitization.

Red meat allergy is induced by IgE specific for galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal), structurally similar to the blood group B-antigen. A study of red meat allergic patients indicated that blood group B individuals had almost no IgE to α-Gal, suggesting that self-tolerance reduces the risk of developing allergies.

### Eaaci guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^112RATHC]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Table 1 summarises the recommendations about the management of IgE‐mediated food allergy, which are presented and discussed below.

- **Dietary management**: In patients with confirmed IgE‐mediated food allergy, avoidance of the food (or form of the food) to which the patient is allergic is recommended.

- **Reason for recommendation**: The complete avoidance of a known trigger food is the only option for many individuals with a confirmed IgE‐mediated food allergy to one or more foods. However, for food allergies such as pollen‐food syndrome, where it is known that cooked or processed versions of the food may be tolerated, individuals may be able to only avoid the raw or unprocessed version of the trigger food. This is also true for children allergic to cow's milk or hen's egg where baked forms of the food can be tolerated, even while still reacting to the fresh or raw form of the food. For other foods, processing can increase allergenicity (e.g. roasting of nuts and seeds).

- **Strength of recommendation**: The evidence base is low as there have been no RCTs evaluating and comparing outcomes for patients with a food allergy who continue to eat small amounts or an altered form of the food (e.g. baked) and those who completely avoid it — clinical trials are underway. However, the panel formulated a strong recommendation, placing a high value on the risk of a severe allergic reaction upon exposure to food that can be fatal.

- **Practical implications**:

### Eaaci food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: diagnosis and management of food allergy [^113rVHF6]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for food allergy, EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend eliciting a detailed clinical history to evaluate patients with suspected food allergy. This includes inquiring about allergens, timing and chronicity, symptoms, severity and signs, reproducibility, known risk factors, family history, and coexisting medical problems, including other allergic diseases. Use structured questions on symptoms, foods, and other background information.

### Clinical relevance of cross-reactivity in food allergy [^117PxF4g]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of food allergy is complicated by an abundance of homologous, cross-reactive proteins in edible foods and aeroallergens. This results in patients having allergic sensitization (positive tests) to many biologically related foods. However, many are sensitized to foods without exhibiting clinical reactivity. Although molecular diagnostics have improved our ability to identify clinically relevant cross-reactivity, the optimal approach to patients requires an understanding of the epidemiology of clinically relevant cross-reactivity, as well as the food-specific (degree of homology, protein stability, abundance) and patient-specific factors (immune response, augmentation factors) that determine clinical relevance.

- **Examples of food families with different rates of cross-reactivity**: High rates of cross-reactivity are seen in mammalian milks, eggs, fish, and shellfish. Conversely, low rates are noted for grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. Rates of cross-reactivity are variable for most other foods.

This review discusses clinically relevant cross-reactivity related to the aforementioned food groups as well as seeds, legumes (including peanut, soy, chickpea, lentil, and others), tree nuts, meats, fruits and vegetables (including the lipid transfer protein syndrome), and latex. The complicating factor of addressing co-allergy, for example, the risks of allergy to both peanut and tree nuts among atopic patients, is also discussed. Considerations for an approach to individual patient care are highlighted.

### Sunflower seeds as eliciting agents of Compositae dermatitis [^113tMoRi]. Contact Dermatitis (2015). Low credibility.

Sunflowers may cause dermatitis because of allergenic sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). Contact sensitization to sunflower seeds has also been reported, but the allergens are unknown.

- **Objectives**: To analyze sunflower seeds for the presence of SLs and to assess the prevalence of sunflower sensitization in Compositae-allergic individuals.

- **Patients/materials/methods**: Sunflower-sensitive patients were identified by aimed patch testing. A dichloromethane extract of whole sunflower seeds was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography.

- **Results**: The prevalence of sensitivity to sunflower in Compositae-allergic individuals was 56%. A solvent wash of whole sunflower seeds yielded an extract containing SLs, the principal component tentatively being identified as argophyllin A or B, with other SLs being present in minute amounts.

- **Conclusions**: The concentration of SLs on the sunflower seeds is considered high enough to elicit dermatitis in sensitive persons, and it seems appropriate to warn Compositae-allergic subjects against handling sunflower seeds.

### Is oral isotretinoin treatment contraindicated for patients with known peanut allergies [^1112pgwi]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The criterion standard for the treatment of severe nodular cystic acne, oral isotretinoin, contains soybean oil, which is contraindicated in patients with a soy immunoglobulin E–mediated allergy. Given the possibility of soy–peanut cross-reactivity, isotretinoin leaflets in the United Kingdom and Australia indicate that the drug is contraindicated in patients who have allergies to peanut or soy. This has been discussed in European dermatologic literature. We recently had a patient who was initially denied access to isotretinoin because of his peanut allergy, and we briefly report our findings in the American dermatologic literature.

### Xolair [^1153Rg96]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Xolair for the reduction of allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 year and older with IgE-mediated food allergy. Use of Xolair for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study that included a total of 165 pediatric patients; 61 patients aged 1 year to less than 6 years of age and 104 patients aged 6 to less than 18 years of age. A significantly greater percentage of Xolair-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients was able to consume a single dose of food (peanut, cashew, milk, egg) without dose-limiting symptoms [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with IgE-mediated food allergy below 1 year of age have not been established.

- **Chronic spontaneous urticaria**: The safety and effectiveness of Xolair for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), in patients who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment, have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Use of Xolair in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies. Adolescent patients with CSU were evaluated in 39 patients aged 12 to 17 years (Xolair 29, placebo 10) included in three randomized, placebo-controlled CSU trials. A numerical decrease in weekly itch score was observed, and adverse reactions were similar to those reported in patients 18 years and older.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with CSU below the age of 12 have not been established.

### Eaaci guidelines on allergen immunotherapy: IgE-mediated food allergy [^113zK7Mg]. Allergy (2018). High credibility.

For the medical management of food allergy, specifically focusing on specific immunotherapy, the EAACI 2018 guidelines recommend:

- **Specific IgE levels and skin prick testing**: Conduct a careful evaluation of specific IgE levels and skin prick testing.
- **Concomitant asthma control**: Ensure that asthma is controlled concomitantly before initiating food allergen immunotherapy, as high levels of specific IgE, skin reactivity, and uncontrolled asthma are risk factors for adverse events.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^115FckNG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Who should be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector? Although there is some variation, anaphylaxis guidelines typically recommend epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) prescription to any patient with a history of anaphylaxis who cannot easily avoid re-exposure to the causative allergen. Anaphylaxis to medication or radiocontrast media in isolation is not usually an indication for EAI because these allergens are generally easy to avoid outside of healthcare settings. Patients with a latex allergy may find it challenging to avoid accidental exposure, particularly if their exposure is occupationally related.

Guidelines also encourage EAI prescription to patients without prior anaphylaxis but with risk factors considered to raise their risk of anaphylaxis, such as a diagnosis of asthma or a prior reaction to a "trace" amount of allergen. However, the evidence supporting many of these factors is very limited. For example, data suggest that previous mild reactions to "trace" amounts of allergens or a diagnosis of asthma do not increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Although poorly controlled asthma is likely to be a risk factor, supporting evidence is lacking.

Data suggest that at least for peanut allergy, "the absence of prior anaphylaxis [is likely to] reflect insufficient allergen exposure rather than an inherently lower risk of anaphylaxis". Guidelines often flag adolescents and young adults as being at higher risk (albeit still very low) of near-fatal and fatal anaphylaxis, whereas epidemiological studies show that this risk remains elevated well into the fourth decade.

### Eaaci guidelines on the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^111U1tmh]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

When conducting diagnostic investigations for peanut allergy, particularly concerning serum IgE, the EAACI 2023 guidelines advise obtaining serum specific IgE to certain allergens, if available. This should be done in addition to skin prick tests and/or IgE to extracts, in patients with suspected IgE-mediated allergy to respective nuts, to further support a food allergy diagnosis. The specific allergens recommended are:

- **Peanut**: Ara h 2
- **Hazelnut**: Cor a 14
- **Cashew nut**: Ana o 3

### A. Dust [^116fJVSC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Studies indicate that allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to allergens. Subsequent exposure to the allergen results in a combination of the allergen with IgE antibodies fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes. This cross-linking stimulates mast cells, leading to the release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce an immediate hypersensitivity reaction.

The mode of action of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is still under investigation. Subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of allergenic extract into patients with allergic diseases have been shown to result in both humoral and cellular changes. These changes include the production of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, suppression of histamine release from target cells, a decrease in circulating levels of antigen-specific IgE antibodies over long periods of time, and suppression of peripheral blood T-lymphocyte cell responses to antigens.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^115yTvJw]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Evolution of symptoms and clinical reactivity at food challenge reveals that many individuals experience initially subjective symptoms, with objective symptoms appearing with further doses. Anaphylaxis will only develop if the food challenge continues. Some may experience anaphylaxis as their first objective symptom, either at a dose of allergen exposure with no preceding subjective symptoms or with prior subjective symptoms, without evidence of a clear dose-response for symptoms. It is important to note that anaphylaxis can occur at all levels of exposure, both at low levels of allergen exposure and at higher doses.

For any given individual patient, the absence of prior anaphylaxis may be due to insufficient allergen exposure causing previous reactions, rather than the patient being at an inherently lower risk. Therefore, a history (or lack thereof) of anaphylaxis is a poor predictor of future anaphylaxis. Reassuringly, there is no robust evidence that food-allergic individuals who react to very low levels of allergen are at greater risk of anaphylaxis.

A history of reaction to only relatively large exposures (with no or minimal symptoms to smaller doses) may be useful in informing the approach to allergen avoidance for any given individual. This is particularly significant given more recent data suggesting that reaction thresholds for a food-allergic person are fairly reproducible under typical challenge conditions, at least for peanuts.

### Evaluation of food-pollen cross-reactivity by nose-mouth cross-challenge in pollinosis with oral allergy syndrome [^116VVUFy]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is often associated with pollen-induced rhinitis, and there are preferential associations between causative substances. If OAS and rhinitis are both immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated and there are cross-reacting proteins, it is expected that similar reactions can be elicited in the nose and mouth. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed a series of 'cross-challenges' with foods and pollens in both the nose and the mouth.

- **Methods**: Nine patients with ascertained OAS due to vegetables and rhinitis due to pollens were studied. On the first day, a nasal challenge with pollen extracts and an oral challenge with fresh food was carried out. After a week, a washout nasal challenge with food and an oral challenge with pollens were performed. Immediate symptoms, mucosal tryptase, and soluble eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were assessed after each challenge.

- **Results**: The administration of pollen into the nose and food into the mouth elicited symptoms as expected, but the cross-challenge had no clinical effect. In parallel, tryptase and ECP increased after nasal challenge with pollens, whereas foods did not elicit a measurable response.

- **Conclusion**: The cross-reactivity between foods and pollens, when evaluated at the shock organ, was not clinically evident. This data can be explained by a low concentration of cross-reagent epitopes in pollen extracts and food homogenized because of degradation. The different behavior upon challenge suggests that different immunological mechanisms may act in the nose and mouth.

### Peanut allergy: An increasingly common life-threatening disorder [^112jwdLb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to peanuts in children have become a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising incidence of this potentially fatal condition. Peanut allergy represents an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to peanut proteins and is responsible for the majority of cases of food-induced anaphylaxis. Even trace quantities of peanut in a sensitized individual can be fatal, with a rapid onset of symptoms often including the cutaneous findings of urticaria, angioedema, or diffuse nonspecific dermatitis. Peanut allergy is usually a lifelong condition since only about 20% of affected individuals outgrow it. Some schools ban peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, once a common dietary option, as fear of medical and legal consequences is escalating. Children with peanut allergy and their families should be knowledgeable about management strategies, including carrying and properly administering self-injectable epinephrine. New immunotherapeutic options are being investigated and appear promising.

### An allergen from Olea europaea pollen (Ole e 7) is associated with plant-derived food anaphylaxis [^116kK65z]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Several cross-reacting proteins have been identified as responsible for the co-occurrence of pollinosis and plant-derived food allergy. This association has been mainly described in the birch-apple syndrome, but other pollens such as Olea europaea and other fruits may also contain homologous proteins.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the associations between sensitization to allergens of Olea europaea pollen and confirmed plant-derived food allergy. Additionally, the study investigates if any pattern of clinical hypersensitivity of food allergy reaction (oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or anaphylaxis) and/or any fresh fruit or nut allergy is associated with one or several Olea pollen allergen(s).

- **Methods**: One hundred and thirty-four consecutive patients diagnosed with pollinosis by Olea were studied. Of these patients, only 40 reported adverse reactions to plant-derived food. Twenty-one (group A) were classified as OAS, and 19 (group B) as anaphylaxis. Skin tests with six Olea pollen allergens and several groups of fruits were performed. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) confirmed the diagnostics of food allergy, excluding patients who suffered previous anaphylactic reactions.

- **Results**: All patients showed a positive skin prick test (SPT) against one or more of Olea europaea allergens. Sensitization to Ole e 7 was more frequent (P = 0.02) in patients from group B. A total of 84 DBPCFCs were performed, with 44% positive results. The challenge confirmed at least 50% of positive SPT in any case (peach: 68.42%; pear: 50%; melon: 71.42%; and kiwi: 53.84%).

### Fenugreek allergy caused by cross-reactivity with peanut: An analysis [^115wMS76]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), a spice often used in curry and other dishes, belongs to the family Fabaceae, the same family as peanuts and other legumes. Dried fenugreek seeds are roasted, ground into a powder, and used as a spice, dye, and medicine. Spice allergies affect about 0.04% to 0.13% of the general population, mostly owing to cross-reactions with pollen allergens (mainly PR-10 and profilin), resulting in a secondary spice allergy known as celery-birch-mugwort-spice syndrome. Many reported cases of fenugreek allergy include suspected clinical cross-reactivity with peanuts. In vitro cross-reactivity between peanut and legumes other than fenugreek has been reported; however, there have been no reports of in vitro cross-reactivity between peanut and fenugreek based on serum from patients with fenugreek allergy. Here, we report a pediatric case of fenugreek allergy and examine the origin and causative allergen.

We conducted skin prick tests, measurements of allergen-specific IgE levels, and oral food challenge (OFC) to diagnose food allergies. For the skin prick test, a commercial peanut allergen (Torii Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), various spices purchased from a supermarket (10 mg/mL), and causative foods were used. Allergen-specific IgE levels were measured using the ImmunoCAP system (Thermo Fisher Scientific/Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Sensitization to allergens was defined as skin prick tests resulting in a wheal diameter of 3 mm or larger or an IgE level of 0.35 kU A /L or higher. In the OFCs, the peanuts and spices were used in ham.

### Managing food allergy when the patient is not highly allergic [^114GgnAS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Few patients with food allergy are "highly allergic", meaning they always have severe reactions and react to very small amounts of allergen. Standard medical approaches for allergy management have focused on the safety and lifestyle modifications this group truly needs, but consequently, families with food allergy are typically advised to strictly avoid any exposure to their implicated allergens. Most food-allergic subjects are not reactive to very low doses, and many never experience severe reactions.

- **Alternative care plans**: Notable conditions where a different care plan is commonly offered include cases with pollen-related food allergy syndrome, food-associated exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and resolving or mild milk or egg allergy. In these situations, patients might be advised to ingest the allergens in specific circumstances with detailed instructions.

- **Oral immunotherapy and prevention**: Because oral immunotherapy and allergy prevention by early exposure have emphasized alternatives to strict avoidance, there is increasing interest in prospects to forego strict avoidance in those with food allergy. For patients with a high threshold of reactivity (low-dose tolerant, high-dose mildly reactive), there may be options such as allowing the ingestion of products with precautionary allergen labels, allowing dietary indiscretions with small amounts of the allergen, or even encouraging ingestion of subthreshold amounts with therapeutic intent.

These practices have not been extensively studied and could be considered controversial. If these approaches are considered, shared decision-making is needed in discussing them with patients.

### Unveiling unique allergenic properties of rapeseed oil: A clinical case study [^116cuYSM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

After the patient's clinical history had been studied, a molecular analysis of the protein and allergen profiles of the samples was carried out. The Western blot assay detected the presence of different protein bands in the lipid part of the rapeseed extract in both reducing and nonreducing conditions (at molecular weights of ∼37 kDa and ∼70 kDa, respectively). There are no rapeseed allergens with these characteristics described in the literature. It should be noted that the allergens to which our patient is sensitized are found only in the lipid part of the study food, coinciding with the patient's clinical history, as his reactions were triggered by rapeseed oil.

This case study underscores the potential allergenicity of rapeseed oil and suggests the presence within its lipid portion of distinct protein bands that may be responsible for the patient's allergic responses, particularly in the context of the modern diet, in which rapeseed oil is increasingly being used in food products. The processing of canola oil makes it less allergenic than rapeseed oil, as it contains fewer proteins despite both oils having been derived from the same plant. The implications of rapeseed oil allergy are significant, as this oil is widely used in processed foods, restaurant cooking, and even nonfood products such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Patients with confirmed sensitivity may need to adopt strict dietary vigilance and avoid products containing rapeseed oil. Additionally, improved food labeling and allergen testing are necessary to support individuals at risk.

### Clinical implications of cross-reactive food allergens [^112Nq6ex]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

As a consequence of the general increase in allergic sensitization, the prevalence of hypersensitivity reactions to multiple foods that share homologous proteins has become a significant clinical problem. A variety of these allergens conserved among plants (e.g. profilin and lipid transfer proteins) and animals (e.g. tropomyosin and caseins) have been characterized. Although studies with molecular biologic techniques have elucidated the nature of these ubiquitous allergens, clinical studies have lagged behind. Physicians are called on to determine the risk of reaction to related foods among legumes, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, cereal grains, mammalian and avian food products, and a variety of other plant-derived foods that may share proteins with pollens, latex, and each other.

Clinical evaluations require a careful history, laboratory evaluation, and in some cases, oral food challenges. The pitfalls in the evaluation of food allergy, including unreliable histories and limitations in laboratory assessment primarily caused by false-positive skin prick test responses/RAST results, are magnified when dealing with cross-reactive proteins. This review focuses on the clinical data regarding cross-reacting food allergens with the goal of providing a background for improved risk assessment and a framework on which to approach these difficult clinical questions.

### Risk assessment in anaphylaxis: current and future approaches [^116UmPCp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Risk assessment of individuals with anaphylaxis is currently hampered by the lack of (1) an optimal and readily available laboratory test to confirm the clinical diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode and (2) an optimal method of distinguishing allergen-sensitized individuals who are clinically tolerant from those at risk for anaphylaxis episodes after exposure to the relevant allergen. Our objectives were to review the effector mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis; to explore the possibility of developing an optimal laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis of an anaphylaxis episode and the possibility of improving methods to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical reactivity; and to develop a research agenda for risk assessment in anaphylaxis.

Researchers from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology held a PRACTALL (Practical Allergy) meeting to discuss these objectives. New approaches being investigated to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis include serial measurements of total tryptase in serum during an anaphylaxis episode and measurement of baseline total tryptase levels after the episode. Greater availability of the test for mature beta-tryptase, a more specific mast cell activation marker for anaphylaxis than total tryptase, is needed. Measurement of chymase, mast cell carboxypeptidase A3, platelet-activating factor, and other mast cell products may prove to be useful. Consideration should be given to measuring a panel of mediators from mast cells and basophils.

### Peanut can be used as a reference allergen for hazard characterization in food allergen risk management: A rapid evidence assessment and meta-analysis [^1152odjS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

The inclusion of soya as a priority allergen in Codex is under review, with a recent recommendation from an FAO/WHO expert committee for its removal as a global priority allergen based on a low level of prevalence and low frequency as a cause of anaphylaxis. For soybean, five studies were identified in the literature (Table E10, available in this article's online repository). Consistent with data suggesting that soybean is an uncommon cause of anaphylaxis globally, no cases of anaphylaxis to low (< 200 mg of protein) levels of exposure were identified.

### Will oral food challenges still be part of allergy care in 10 years' time [^116m5VbP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The oral food challenges (OFCs) in IgE and non-IgE–mediated food allergy show both similarities and differences. The design of OFCs differs when assessing for possible non-IgE–mediated food allergies. Unlike IgE-mediated food allergies, for food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, there is no broad consensus regarding the framework for dosing. Often, the design of the OFC reflects the timing of reaction ascertained through the clinical history.

Given the length of observation periods in some food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome challenges, a shift toward multiple-step food challenges, in which part of the assessment occurs in the home setting, has been proposed. However, the safety of this approach has yet to be fully assessed.

In other suspected non-IgE–mediated food allergies, such as to cow's milk, the diagnosis is generally based on the elimination of the allergen and its reintroduction over longer periods (typically at least 2–6 weeks). The food of interest is usually administered at home with the support of dietitians when needed, and the patient or family is responsible for observing any time relation between food exposure and symptoms.

Because of the longer interval between exposure and symptoms, the practice is to allow sequential food challenges to occur at home using food ladders. However, there has recently been an expansion toward using the ladder approach to sequential food challenges in the home setting for some IgE-mediated food allergies in low-risk patients. It is acknowledged that a robust safety framework, including patient selection, is needed for this approach.

### Is pea our hidden allergen? An American pediatric case series [^116VUVUd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

- **Patient 4**: A 15-year-old boy who was previously healthy and had no atopic comorbidities other than a known history of cashew food allergy presented to the clinic for evaluation of new reactions occurring immediately after ingestion of different pea-containing food products. He tolerates peanuts without reactions. His first reaction was to Ripple milk (Ripple Foods, Emeryville, Calif), which is a pea-based milk that does not contain any peanuts or tree nuts, as specified on the label. The second reaction was to Beyond Meat chicken nuggets, which had the same ingredients listed as for the burger consumed by patient 1. The packaging also listed an advisory for pea food allergy, as it did on the burger ingested by patient 1. His last reaction was to a pea-based protein powder. The patient was unsure of the name of the product but was certain that it did not contain tree nuts, given his allergy. His reaction to all three ingestions was immediate hives located over his face and neck. He self-treated with Diphenhydramine HCL, with resolution of his symptoms. His pea-specific serum IgE level was 6.10 kU/L.

- **Patient 5**: A 2-year-old boy with a known allergy to peanut and no other atopic diseases presented for evaluation of a new allergic reaction associated with ingestion of a Chloe's Oat Milk Mint Chip Ice Cream bar (Chloe's Fruit, New York, NY). Immediately after ingestion of the ice cream bar, he experienced perioral hives that were followed by throat clearing and lip swelling. The possible allergens listed on the ingredient list were pea protein, tapioca, flaxseed, sunflower lecithin.

### A systematic review of allergen cross-reactivity: Translating basic concepts into clinical relevance [^114y7MUx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Functional tests are mainly represented by the basophil activation test (BAT), which consists of assessing the activating effect of an allergen extract or MA on a patient's basophils collected by venipuncture. In cases of demonstrated IgE binding to multiple cross-reactive allergens, BAT may provide further information on the ability of each allergen to induce basophil degranulation, which in turn predicts a higher likelihood of clinical relevance. An example of potential BAT application for allergen cross-reactivity assessment is the differential diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy in patients sensitized to multiple venoms. BATs are available in specialized clinical laboratories.

Allergen cross-reactivity assessment in the clinical setting relies mostly on in vitro assessment of IgE binding to cross-reactive MA. Using marker allergens as tools for the confirmation of genuine sensitization is straightforward and requires a limited number of MA IgE assays. On the other hand, investigating a suspected cross-reactive sensitization profile may be challenging due to the question of the number of homologs that need to be assayed. The answer to this depends on anamnesis, first-line investigation results with allergen extracts if available, the risk of severe systemic reactions, and whether specific treatments, such as AIT, are available and dependent on the molecular sensitization profile.

The actual use of MA in the daily practice of allergists varies from one country to another.

### Impact of topical applications of sunflower seed oil on neonatal mortality and morbidity in southern Nepal: a community-based, cluster-randomised trial [^115JbtDv]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Neonatal deaths account for almost half of all child deaths; in 2019, there were approximately 2.44 million deaths, with the vast majority occurring in low and middle-income countries. A main cause of death is complications arising from preterm birth (36% of neonatal deaths), and options for appropriately managing babies born early are limited. In the past 20 years, there has been increased recognition of the important role of skin in neonatal survival and protection from infection. One skin-related intervention is the use of emollient therapy with natural vegetable oils, but most studies of this intervention have focused on prevention of infection rather than survival.

Emollient therapy for reducing infection and improving survival of preterm babies has largely focused on improving the care of babies in intensive care units or hospitalized settings. Efficacy appeared mixed; meta-analysis and systematic reviews in some studies showed that nosocomial infection risk was not reduced, while others showed reductions in infection and neonatal mortality.

Further, studies in animal models of the varying impact of commonly used natural vegetable oils in mice suggested that one of the most used oils, mustard seed oil, was perhaps the least appropriate for skin recovery after massage, while exposure to sunflower seed oil appeared to mitigate these effects and possibly accelerate skin barrier function. These observations, in particular, the demonstration of accelerated skin recovery after application of high-linoleic acid sunflower seed oil, and its ability to enhance skin…

### Peanut allergy is common among hazelnut-sensitized subjects but is not primarily the result of IgE cross-reactivity [^115iMwrR]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Hazelnut and peanut are botanically unrelated foods, but patients are often sensitized and allergic to both for reasons that are not well understood.

- **Methods**: To investigate molecular cosensitization and cross-reactivity to peanut in hazelnut-sensitized individuals, children (n = 81) and adults (n = 80) were retrospectively selected based on sensitization to hazelnut. IgE to hazelnut extract, Cor a 1, 8, 9, and 14, to peanut extract, Ara h 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9, and to Bet v 1 was determined by ImmunoCAP. Allergy to hazelnut and peanut was established by DBPCFC and/or detailed clinical history. Patients were either tolerant or displayed subjective or objective symptoms to either food. IgE cross-reactivity between hazelnut and peanut storage proteins was assessed by reciprocal ImmunoCAP inhibition experiments.

- **Results**: Of the 161 hazelnut-sensitized subjects, 109 (68%) were also sensitized to peanut, and 73 (45%) had clinical expression of allergy to peanut that was not associated with the presence or severity of hazelnut allergy. Instead, it was associated with IgE reactivity to peanut storage proteins, in particular Ara h 2. No cross-reactivity could be detected between Ara h 2 and Cor a 14, and 2 of 13 subjects displayed extensive cross-reactivity between 11S globulins; in plasma of both individuals, Ara h 3 almost completely inhibited IgE binding to Cor a 9.

- **Conclusions**: Peanut allergy is not primarily the result of IgE cross-reactivity to hazelnut storage proteins. IgE to Cor a 14 and Ara h 2 may serve as useful markers of primary sensitization to hazelnut.

### Oilseed rape flour: Another allergen causing occupational asthma among farmers [^112bR97C]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Farmers are exposed to a wide variety of sensitizers. Since occupational asthma (OA) can lead to permanent disability, exposure discontinuation is the preferred treatment. When this is not possible, identifying the causative allergen may allow an alternative therapy.

- **Methods**: We present three farmers diagnosed with OA as a consequence of handling fodder. We carried out skin tests with common and occupational allergens and with oilseed rape (OSR) extract. Total and specific serum IgE levels were measured. The patients underwent the OSR-bronchial provocation test (OSR-BPT). The day before and 24 hours after the OSR-BPT, the methacholine (M)-BPT and induced sputum were performed. Eosinophil percentages and ECP levels were measured in the sputum samples.

- **Results**: OSR sensitization (skin tests and specific serum IgE) was detected in all the patients. The OSR-BPT elicited early responses in two subjects. Methacholine sensitivity, sputum eosinophils, and sputum ECP levels increased 24 hours after the OSR-BPT in all the patients.

- **Conclusions**: We have demonstrated that inhalation of OSR flour causes bronchoconstriction, induces an eosinophilic inflammatory bronchial response, and increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness in sensitized asthmatics. OSR flour contained in animal fodder should be considered another potential cause of OA among farmers.

### Hypersensitivities to sesame and other common edible seeds [^112zv8Aq]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Several seeds have been increasingly incorporated into various food items, with consequent risks of hypersensitivity reactions that are often severe. Identification of the specific seed as the culprit is often not explored or is difficult to verify. In this article, we reviewed the English literature from January 1930 to March 2016 using PubMed and Google Scholar, searching for publications relevant to hypersensitivity to common edible seeds, namely sesame, sunflower seed, poppy seed, pumpkin seed, flaxseed, and mustard seed. Considering the worldwide consumption of these seeds, the number of published articles on the subject was relatively small and was mainly in the form of case reports rather than large series. Allergy to sesame was more reported than to other seeds, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1% to 0.2%.

In this review, we summarize the information relevant to each of the six seeds and their oils regarding the manifestations, routes of exposure, identified major allergens, and cross-reactivity with other seeds or other foods. We also addressed the important role of thorough history-taking in suspecting seed allergy, the limited reliability of routine diagnostic procedures, and the importance of verification by appropriate challenge tests. At present, management is primarily dietary avoidance and the use of symptomatic medications, which may include epinephrine auto-injectors. We did not encounter any well-designed studies on immunotherapy for seed allergy, but it is hoped that such a gap will be filled by the development of safe and effective protocols in the near future.

### The importance of the 2S albumins for allergenicity and cross-reactivity of peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds [^112Lim17]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds are among the most critical food-related causes of anaphylaxis. Important clinical questions include: Why is there a variable occurrence of co-allergy among these foods, and is this immunologically mediated? The clinical and immunologic data summarized here suggest an immunologic basis for these co-allergies that is rooted in similarities among the 2S albumins. Data from component-resolved diagnostics have highlighted the relationship between IgE binding to these allergens and the presence of IgE-mediated food allergies. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments provide strong evidence that the 2S albumins are the most significant allergens in peanuts for inducing an allergic effector response.

Although the 2S albumins are diverse, they have a common disulfide-linked core with similar physicochemical properties that make them prime candidates to explain much of the observed co-allergy among peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds. The well-established frequency of cashew and pistachio nut co-allergy (64%-100%) underscores how the structural similarities among their 2S albumins may account for observed clinical cross-reactivity. A complete understanding of the physicochemical properties of the 2S albumins in peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds will enhance our ability to diagnose, treat, and ultimately prevent these allergies.

### The 18 KDA peanut oleosin is a candidate allergen for IgE-mediated reactions to peanuts [^1177Ntz9]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Peanut allergy is one of the five most frequent food allergies in children and adults. Recently, we purified and evaluated the allergenicity of peanut oleosins, a family of small-sized proteins involved in the formation of peanut oil bodies.

- **Methods**: Allergenicity of the purified native protein and of the recombinant protein was tested by Western blot and IgE-RIA.

- **Results**: We found IgE-binding with oleosin in 3 of 14 sera of patients who had suffered an allergic reaction to peanuts. Two sera reacted weakly against 16–18 kDa proteins corresponding to oleosin monomers in Western blot. The main reacting bands had a molecular size estimated at approximately 34 kDa, 50 kDa, and 68 kDa, which could correspond to oleosin oligomers. IgE reactivity was higher in extracts from roasted peanuts. The same phenomenon occurred with crude soybean oil fraction, with two bands of 16.5 and 24 kDa corresponding to monomers, and two bands of 50 kDa and 76 kDa corresponding to dimers and trimers, respectively. The 18 kDa band was observed in the 3 Western blots of a membrane-enriched fraction of recombinant oleosin produced in the Sf9-baculovirus expression system (performed with the 3 patient sera).

- **Conclusions**: We have characterized a new peanut allergen which belongs to the oleosins, a family of proteins involved in the formation of oil bodies. The protein may be involved in some of the allergic cross-reactions to peanuts and soybeans.

### Unveiling unique allergenic properties of rapeseed oil: A clinical case study [^111ijCBJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Rapeseed (Brassica napus), a plant from the Brassicaceae family, is a widely used source of oil in both industrial applications (e.g. lubricants) and food products, particularly in Europe. Despite its widespread use, allergic reactions associated with rapeseed have been largely underreported. However, occupational exposure to rapeseed dust is associated with a significant risk of IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction among grain industry workers.

The allopolyploid evolution of Brassica napus, originating from hybridization between Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, underlines its genetic complexity and adaptation. This genetic diversity is pivotal in elucidating the allergenic potential associated specifically with Brassica napus and its derivatives. The evolutionary trajectory of the Brassica napus genome following Neolithic agricultural practices underscores its historical and contemporary agricultural importance.

A study conducted in India investigated hypersensitivity reactions to pollen extracts from Brassica napus. The findings revealed varying degrees of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity among atopic individuals. Major IgE-binding allergenic proteins identified from Brassica napus included those with molecular weights of 56, 76, 87, and 90 kDa. These findings manifest the necessity of comprehending local allergenic profiles for effective diagnosis and management of Brassica napus–related allergies and derivatives within the Indian population.

The objective of this study was to investigate potential food allergy related to rapeseed oil. Informed consent was obtained.

### Peanut oleosins associated with severe peanut allergy-importance of lipophilic allergens for comprehensive allergy diagnostics [^113aZaSi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Peanut allergy is one of the most common and severe food allergies in Western countries, making accurate diagnosis crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. However, aqueous extracts used for routine diagnostic measurements often exclude lipophilic allergens such as oleosins. We have recently succeeded in isolating and purifying these unique proteins. The present study evaluates their allergenic potential and clinical relevance.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess allergenicity and sensitization prevalence of oleosins obtained from both raw and in-shell roasted peanuts. In addition, we tested the utilization of natural and recombinant oleosins for allergy diagnostic purposes.

- **Methods**: Oleosin sensitization, prevalence, and the impact of thermal processing were analyzed using immunoblot with sera from 52 peanut-allergic individuals displaying different clinical phenotypes. The application of natural and recombinant oleosins for allergy diagnostics was investigated by basophil activation test (BAT). IgE-binding epitopes were identified by oligopeptide microarray.

- **Results**: Sensitization to oleosins was observed exclusively in peanut-allergic subjects suffering from severe systemic reactions. The IgE-binding capacity of oleosins derived from in-shell roasted peanuts was increased, as shown by immunoblot analysis and BAT. Both natural and recombinant molecules can be used to identify oleosin-sensitized patients by BAT. A linear epitope of Ara h 15 was determined, displaying high similarity to other seed-derived oleosins.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the importance of including lipophilic oleosins in allergy diagnostics to improve accuracy when identifying patients at risk of severe peanut allergies.
