## Question

US Doppler 2 Dw/ M mode complete

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes a "US Doppler 2D/M-mode complete" transthoracic echocardiogram and how to define its required components, acquisition standards, and documentation/reporting requirements. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and whether this phrase maps to a standard comprehensive TTE. Then, I should verify the mandatory imaging modalities and Doppler elements. Next, I will review acquisition parameters and instrumentation settings. After that, I need to check the measurement and quantification requirements. Finally, I will confirm documentation, reporting, and coding elements to ensure the study is complete and billable, and I will reconcile any ambiguities in nomenclature along the way [^114L6sRD] [^112bqjQW].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the study. "US Doppler 2D/M-mode complete" in routine cardiology practice corresponds to a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) that includes two-dimensional imaging, M-mode, and Doppler (color, pulsed-wave, and continuous-wave), which is precisely how ASE defines a complete adult TTE and how appropriate use criteria assume 2D/M-mode and Doppler are included in a standard study [^114L6sRD] [^1165MXso].

> I need to ensure the core imaging modalities are explicitly required. The examination must include 2D imaging of all standard cardiac views, M-mode for selected linear measurements and timing, color Doppler for regurgitation and shunt visualization, pulsed-wave Doppler for velocity sampling at specific depths, and continuous-wave Doppler for high-velocity jets; these are the backbone of a complete study and are reiterated across ASE comprehensive TTE guidance and quality standards [^1165MXso] [^112bqjQW] [^111eSSsq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about M-mode being "optional". While some contemporary adult quantification guidelines de-emphasize routine linear M-mode for chamber sizing, ASE still recognizes M-mode for specific tasks such as valve timing, IVC dynamics, and certain linear measurements; thus, M-mode remains a required component in a "complete" study even if 2D or 3D are preferred for many quantifications, so I should keep M-mode in the mandatory list while noting its selective use [^111bX5ZV] [^115dPCD6] [^1165MXso].

> Next, I should review the Doppler elements in detail. Color Doppler must be used to screen all valves and expected shunt regions, pulsed-wave Doppler should interrogate all valves and vessels as indicated, and continuous-wave Doppler is required when high velocities are suspected (e.g., aortic stenosis, severe regurgitations, coarctation); ASE also calls for hepatic vein Doppler when appropriate and emphasizes using multiple views to capture the highest velocity of abnormal flows, which I should double-check is documented in the acquisition log [^112bqjQW] [^111eSSsq] [^116FYFWR].

> I will now examine acquisition parameters because suboptimal settings can invalidate measurements. For spectral Doppler, a sweep speed of 100 mm/sec is the default for velocity and time-interval measurements, with baseline and velocity scale adjusted to maximize the signal without aliasing; for color Doppler, gain should be set just below random speckle and the color box sized to balance frame rate and region of interest; for 2D, harmonic imaging at the highest feasible frequency should be used, and sector width/focus should be optimized to maximize frame rate and resolution; I should confirm these are consistently applied across studies [^113NmJeD] [^11459Z1m] [^116wGdD6] [^116UC1B8].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement and quantification requirements so I don't miss a key element. Linear dimensions, wall thickness, and valve excursion should be measured using 2D-guided approaches when possible; LV volumes/EF are preferably by 3D or 2D biplane if 3D is unavailable; LA volume index is preferred over M-mode LA diameter; spectral Doppler peak/mean velocities and gradients should be recorded for all interrogated valves and shunts; and tissue Doppler e′ velocities should be obtained for diastolic function assessment; I should also ensure that LV mass, when calculated, follows ASE formulas and that serial studies use consistent methods [^111bX5ZV] [^113EDkPL] [^111RqHeY] [^11158ia8].

> Let me consider additional elements that distinguish a complete study from a limited one. A complete TTE should include IVC diameter and collapsibility, suprasternal views of the aortic arch, and, when indicated, agitated saline contrast for shunt detection; these are explicitly recommended in ASE quality standards and should be documented as attempted or performed to meet completeness criteria [^112bqjQW].

> I should confirm documentation and reporting standards so the study is auditable and comparable. The report must state the modalities performed (2D, M-mode, color Doppler, PW/CW Doppler, and any 3D/strain), list quantitative measurements with normal/abnormal designation and age-appropriate reference ranges, include a structured assessment of valves, chambers, and great vessels, note any limitations, and record notification of critical findings; pediatric reports additionally require Z-scores and growth parameters, which I need to ensure are captured if the patient is a child [^114A1iXV].

> But wait, what if the phrase implies a billing code rather than a technical description? I should double-check coding alignment. In U.S. billing, a complete TTE with Doppler typically maps to CPT 93306 (complete TTE with spectral and color Doppler), and when contrast is used, hospitals may report C8923 for contrast-enhanced complete TTE; I need to ensure the report and order justify the code and that DICOM-compliant storage is available to meet billing and quality requirements [^116i19nX] [^113FsUfB].

> Let me reconsider any ambiguities and summarize to ensure internal consistency. "US Doppler 2D/M-mode complete" denotes a comprehensive TTE that includes 2D imaging of all standard views, selective but required M-mode for timing and linear measures, and complete Doppler (color, PW, CW) with optimized acquisition parameters; it mandates quantitative measurements of chambers, valves, and flows; it includes IVC, suprasternal views, and contrast when indicated; and it requires structured reporting with modality documentation and critical findings communication; this aligns with ASE comprehensive TTE guidance and appropriate use criteria, and it remains the standard against which limited studies are contrasted [^114L6sRD] [^112bqjQW] [^1165MXso].

A complete US Doppler 2D/M-mode study is a **comprehensive echocardiogram** that integrates 2D imaging, M-mode, and Doppler to assess cardiac structure and function. It includes **2D views of all chambers and valves** [^114A1iXV], **M-mode for timing and motion analysis** [^115dPCD6], and **color, pulsed-wave, and continuous-wave Doppler** [^113eiEcJ] to evaluate blood flow, valve function, and hemodynamics [^112bqjQW]. This multimodal approach enables accurate diagnosis and quantification of cardiac disease, with **documentation of measurements, images, and a structured report** [^114A1iXV] [^111S8r4L].

## Components of a complete US Doppler 2D/M-mode study

### Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography

- **Standard views**: Parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis, apical four-chamber, apical two-chamber, apical three-chamber, and subcostal views [^1135b7Dh].
- **Assessment**: Cardiac chambers, valves, walls, pericardium, and great vessels [^114A1iXV].
- **Measurements**: Chamber dimensions, wall thickness, valve annuli, and ejection fraction (EF) using Simpson's biplane method [^111bX5ZV].

---

### M-mode echocardiography

- **Timing and motion**: Valve opening/closing, chamber dimensions, and wall motion [^116E4gU9].
- **Measurements**: Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), fractional shortening (FS), and mitral valve excursion (E-point septal separation, EPSS) [^113EDkPL].
- **Limitations**: Limited by angle dependency and poor lateral resolution; use 2D-guided M-mode when possible [^111RqHeY].

---

### Doppler echocardiography

#### Color Doppler

Color Doppler visualizes **flow direction and turbulence** to detect regurgitation, stenosis, and shunts [^112bqjQW]. Settings should be optimized for gain, velocity scale, and color box size to balance image quality and frame rate [^1125XBwB].

---

#### Pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler

PW Doppler samples at a specific depth to provide **velocity at a defined location** [^111eSSsq]. It is used for mitral, tricuspid, pulmonary, and aortic flows; LVOT and RVOT velocities; and pulmonary venous and hepatic venous flows [^112bqjQW]. Limitations include aliasing at high velocities, which necessitates careful scale adjustment [^11459Z1m].

---

#### Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler

CW Doppler measures the **highest velocities along the beam path** without aliasing [^116FYFWR]. It is used for peak gradients across stenotic valves, regurgitant jets, and to estimate pulmonary pressures from tricuspid regurgitation [^114A1iXV]. Because CW Doppler lacks range resolution, align the beam carefully to the jet [^116FYFWR].

---

## Clinical indications

A complete US Doppler 2D/M-mode study is indicated for:

- **Valvular heart disease**: Stenosis, regurgitation, prosthetic valves [^116npfXr].
- **Heart failure**: Systolic and diastolic function assessment [^115kdsSt].
- **Congenital heart disease**: Structural anomalies and shunts [^114A1iXV].
- **Pericardial disease**: Effusion, constriction [^1166XCk3].
- **Cardiomyopathies**: Hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive [^113ChadS].
- **Ischemic heart disease**: Wall motion abnormalities, ventricular function [^113Sjr51].

---

## Standardized protocols and guidelines

The **ASE guidelines** provide comprehensive protocols for adult and pediatric echocardiography, including acquisition, measurements, and reporting [^114L6sRD] [^114A1iXV]. Quality assurance requires adherence to standardized protocols, proper calibration, and regular training [^114QuprW] [^115GFZ2m].

---

## Documentation and reporting

- **Measurements**: Chamber dimensions, wall thickness, valve velocities, gradients, EF, FS, and E/E' ratio [^113EDkPL].
- **Images**: Representative 2D, M-mode, and Doppler recordings [^114A1iXV].
- **Report**: Structured report with clinical indication, findings, limitations, and recommendations [^114A1iXV].

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic value

Comprehensive assessment integrates **structural and hemodynamic data** for accurate diagnosis and management [^116npfXr]. Quantification of **EF**, valve gradients, and pulmonary pressures guides therapy and follow-up [^111YrBUX]. Early detection of cardiac abnormalities enables **timely intervention** and improves outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Patient factors**: Body habitus, lung disease, and poor acoustic windows [^114A1iXV].
- **Operator dependency**: Skill and experience affect image quality and accuracy [^1167Ztex].
- **Technical limitations**: Angle dependency, aliasing, and artifacts [^11459Z1m].

---

A complete US Doppler 2D/M-mode study is a **comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation** that combines 2D imaging, M-mode, and Doppler to assess cardiac structure and function. It is essential for diagnosing and managing a wide range of cardiac conditions, with standardized protocols and quality assurance ensuring accurate, reliable results [^1165MXso].

Instrumentation for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — Operators performing TTE imaging are expected to be familiar with instrumentation settings and their contributions to image quality; some features are determined by system design and cannot be changed by the operator, whereas several settings can be modified during image acquisition or manipulated after data are collected, and these are important for optimal image acquisition. To improve efficiency and consistency, laboratories set up imaging "presets", which are instrumentation settings optimal for a particular patient, anatomic structure, or blood flow and should be considered starting points for optimization, and presets are available for all ultrasound imaging modes, including M-mode, 2D, and all forms of Doppler imaging.

### Role of M-mode technique in today's echocardiography [^113D5tpj]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

M-mode echocardiography is considered to be obsolete by many. The technique rarely is included in American Society of Echocardiography standards documents, except for M-mode measurements, which have limited value. The superior temporal resolution of M-mode echocardiography is frequently overlooked. Doppler recordings reflect blood velocity, whereas M-mode motion of cardiac structures reflect volumetric blood flow. The 2 examinations are hemodynamically complementary. In the current digital era, recording multiple cardiac cycles of two-dimensional echocardiographic images is no longer necessary. However, there are times when intermittent or respiratory changes occur. The M-mode technique is an effective and efficient way to record the necessary multiple cardiac cycles. In certain situations, M-mode recordings of the valves and interventricular septum can be particularly helpful in making a more accurate and complete echocardiographic cardiac assessment, thus helping to make the examination more cost-effective.

Pediatric echocardiography — ventricular size and function assessment states that an objective assessment of cardiac function is recommended, and that M-mode, 2D imaging, and Doppler methods can be used to assess ventricular function, while newer modalities such as 3-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler tissue imaging, and strain and strain rate calculations are promising new techniques that are currently under investigation. For left ventricular (LV) size and systolic function, measurement of LV dimensions in diastole and systole by M-mode and/or 2D imaging is recommended for a complete study, and the parasternal short axis at the midpapillary level is the preferred site for measurement of LV chamber size and wall thickness, but the subcostal short axis can be used as well. The ventricular septum, LV dimension, and LV posterior wall are used to determine LV size and exclude hypertrophy, LV mass may be helpful in patients with long-standing hypertension or other forms of LV hypertrophy, the standard M-mode method of LV systolic function assessment is the shortening fraction, which is affected by loading conditions, altered LV geometry, and regional wall-motion abnormalities, and relatively load-independent indices of myocardial performance based on M-mode measurements are useful for the serial assessment of patients at high risk for diminished function, such as those undergoing chemotherapy.

M-mode echocardiography — operator settings and variations are outlined: "using rapid sweep speeds of 100 to 200 mm/sec is advantageous for making the most accurate time-related measurements", whereas "Other physiologic conditions that require observation of multiple beats may benefit from a slow sweep speed". "Color M mode integrates the color Doppler image with the M-mode tracing" and "may be used to assist with timing of certain color-flow events within the cardiac cycle". "Steerable M mode permits the M-mode cursor to be rotated" so it "can be directed perpendicular to a structure of interest, improving the accuracy of linear M-mode measurements", though "temporal and range resolution are no better than the 2D image parameters, much inferior to directly obtained M-mode images".

Two-dimensional echocardiographic and M-mode measures of LV systolic function — overview and limitations: 2DE and M-mode methods to measure LV systolic function are subject to accuracy and reproducibility errors; qualitative visual inspection is commonly used but has high interobserver and interstudy variability, while standard quantitative options include shortening fraction (SF) from linear measurements and ejection fraction (EF) from LV volumetric measurements, with SF easily measured in parasternal short-axis views using 2DE or M-mode.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113FsUfB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Limited echocardiography equipment and data standards — equipment "should be capable of performing two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, M-mode, color-flow imaging, and spectral and tissue Doppler ultrasound", and "Although all of these modalities may not be used in every case, their availability is critical in preserving the expectation that a patient referred for echocardiography (whether limited or complete) will receive the examination needed to delineate all abnormalities". Examinations "require that a broad selection of transducers be available for use, whereas FCU does not". FCU platforms "are intended to answer a specific clinical question within the technologic limitations of a small device and thus do not require all these modalities", and "The platform of a typical FCU device is incompatible with the performance of detailed or gated measurements that are the minimum professional standard for echocardiography". For image storage and interoperability, "Echocardiographic platforms must store images in a method compatible with DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standards" and "Platforms that do not adhere to the DICOM Format should not be used to perform echocardiography (limited or comprehensive)".

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^116npfXr]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Valvular regurgitation evaluation principles — When transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) provides a complete array of good quality data on the regurgitation, little or no additional information may be needed, but advanced imaging has an important role when data quality is in question or more precise/accurate measurements are required. Comprehensive imaging uses all modalities in the standard TTE evaluation, including M‑mode, 2D, and 3D where applicable, pulsed, color, and continuous wave Doppler, with combined qualitative and quantitative assessment. Integrative interpretation emphasizes that interpretation should not rely on a single parameter. Individualization is required because measures and signs require individualized interpretation, taking into account body size, cause of regurgitation, cardiac compliance and function, acuteness or chronicity, regurgitation dynamics, and hemodynamic conditions at measurement. Precise language requires detailed and comprehensive observations of cause, mechanism, severity, location, associated lesions, and cardiac response, and the language should be standardized and concise.

Left ventricular (LV) global systolic function — definitions and fractional shortening: "Global LV function is usually assessed by measuring the difference between the end-diastolic and end-systolic value of a one-dimensional, 2D, or 3D parameter divided by its end-diastolic value". For timing landmarks, "end-diastole is preferably defined as the first frame after mitral valve closure or the frame in the cardiac cycle in which the respective LV dimension or volume measurement is the largest" and "End-systole is best defined as the frame after aortic valve closure or the frame in which the cardiac dimension or volume is smallest". In regular rhythm, "measurements of the timing of valve openings and closures derived from M-mode echocardiography, pulsed-wave (PW) or continuous-wave Doppler may be used for accurate definitions of ventricular time intervals". For measurement choice, "Fractional shortening can be derived from 2D-guided M-mode imaging or preferably from linear measurements obtained from 2D images".

### Three-dimensional echocardiography [^117ULU3k]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past two to three decades echocardiography has come a considerable distance from the early M-mode machines, and has become an indispensable diagnostic tool in any cardiovascular department. It has long been proved to be safe and cost-effective, and its clinical versatility has steadily increased with the continued integration of newer techniques, such as two-dimensional and harmonic imaging, Doppler and much more. One of the more recent developments in the field is three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). 3DE, in various forms, has been used as a research tool for many years now, but lately improvements in software and transducer technology have begun to facilitate its integration into clinical practice. As with any technique, 3DE has its strengths and weaknesses, and these must be fully appreciated if it is to be utilised effectively.

Transthoracic echocardiography Doppler modes include pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler, high–pulse repetition frequency (HPRF) Doppler, and CW Doppler; PW Doppler is used when one wishes to measure blood flow velocity at a particular depth (range resolution), and the major limitation of PW Doppler is aliasing, which is the inability to display a complete velocity waveform at excessively high velocities.

Instrumentation — ultrasound instruments used for diagnostic studies should include, at a minimum, hardware and software to perform M-mode, 2D imaging, color flow mapping, and spectral Doppler studies, including pulsed wave and continuous wave capabilities; transducers used in pediatric studies should provide adequate imaging across the wide range of depths, with multiple imaging transducers ranging from low frequency (2–2.5 MHz) to high frequency (≥ 7.5 MHz) available, a multifrequency option that includes all these frequencies, and a transducer dedicated to continuous wave Doppler; the video screen and display should be of suitable size and quality, the display should identify the parent institution, a patient identifier, and the date and time of the study, the electrocardiogram should also be displayed in real time with the echocardiographic signal, range or depth markers should be available on all displays, and measurement capabilities must be present to allow distances, areas, blood flow velocities, time intervals, and peak and mean gradients from spectral Doppler studies.

Table 16 — left ventricular function measures using Doppler, speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), and M-mode are outlined with modalities, timing/calculations, utilities, and key pros/cons: Pulmonary vein A-wave reversal duration (pulsed-wave Doppler [PW] apical or parasternal short-axis views) in diastole assesses LV diastolic function, left atrial (LA) function, and mitral valve (MV) function and is described as "Quick and simple" but "Depends on alignment". STE-based peak longitudinal strain measures are listed for apical four-, three-, and two-chamber views (Peak LV4/LV3/LV2) during systole for LV systolic function; for the four-chamber view the table notes "No geometric assumptions" and "Single measurement (no calculations needed)" but also "STE software needed", "Requires good 2DE images", "Intervendor variability", and "Minor angular dependence", and the three- and two-chamber entries state "Same as above" for strengths and weaknesses; "Average GLS" uses apical views with "Systole: average GLS from LV4, LV3, and LV2" for LV systolic function with "Same as above" strengths and weaknesses. Relative wall thickness (RWT) from parasternal short-axis 2DE or M-mode is calculated as "(EDST + EDPWT)/ EDD" for LV size, with strengths including "Quick and simple", "2DE: adjustable alignment to measure along the axis of the largest diameter that bisects both septum and posterior wall", and "M-mode: better temporal resolution" and weaknesses including "Depends on good blood-endocardium border" and "M-mode: cannot correct for lateral cardiac motion during respiratory cycle". The myocardial performance index (MPI) uses PW, continuous-wave (CW), or tissue Doppler in apical views, calculated as "(IVCT + IVRT)/ET" to capture combined LV systolic and diastolic function with "Normal data available" but "Needs similar heart rate in both images" and "No information regarding individual contributions of systolic or diastolic dysfunction". Tissue Doppler measures include isovolumic acceleration (IVA; "MV peak isovolumic annular velocity divided by time to peak velocity") for LV systolic function with weaknesses "Depends on alignment" and "High measurement variability", isovolumic contraction time (IVCT; "Time from end of a' wave to beginning of s' wave") for LV systolic function, and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT; "Time from end of s' wave to beginning of e' wave") for LV diastolic function.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (linear method, 2D) notes that 2D imaging facilitates orientation perpendicular to the LV long axis, but it shares the same geometrical assumptions as M‑mode and the same limitations in patients with abnormal LV geometry; the impact of harmonic imaging on mass calculations and normal values remains to be defined, and normal values are less well established than for M‑mode measurements.

### Guidelines and recommendations for performance of the fetal echocardiogram: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^11679yon]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Equipment — ultrasound systems for fetal echocardiography should have high spatial and temporal resolution, with transabdominal scanning as the standard and curvilinear probes preferred though linear and sector transducers may be used; recommended transducer frequency ranges are 2 to 7 MHz for late second- and third-trimester scans and 5 to 12 MHz for late first-trimester and early second-trimester scans, and minimum capabilities include two-dimensional (2D), M-mode, color flow and pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler; continuous-wave (CW) Doppler may be used to characterize high flow velocities if available, and controls for frequency, harmonics, sector width, and depth should be adjustable to maximize frame rate and lateral resolution.

Image optimization for 2DE, color Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) — where possible, linear measurements should be performed along the direction of the ultrasound beam because spatial resolution is better along this axial plane than along the perpendicular lateral plane, and lateral resolution decreases with increasing depth so views should minimize the distance between the transducer and the structure of interest. Complete sweeps should be performed from base to apex and from right to left, and images should be recorded as a combination of complete sweeps and single-plane clips. For Doppler, the ultrasound beam should be parallel to the direction of flow for color mapping and pulsed-wave (PW) and CW interrogation, and color mapping should precede spectral Doppler interrogation. The color box size and color velocity range should be adjusted to maintain a frame rate of ≥ 20 Hz; a narrower color box with decreased penetration depth results in a higher frame rate, and color compare mode should be used sparingly because frame rate and temporal resolution are decreased compared with a 2DE image alone. For TDI, the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the direction of motion as possible, and longitudinal myocardial velocities should be measured in apical views with the sample volume at the ventricular myocardium immediately adjacent to the valve annulus.

### History of echocardiography and its future applications in medicine [^1147KS1A]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This review concisely presents the chronology of events that shaped the development of echocardiography. The concept of "seeing" structures using "sound" dates back to the 1920s, when ultrasound produced by piezoelectric crystals was used to detect flaws in metals. In the early 1950s, Hertz and Edler described the use of ultrasound for assessing mitral-valve disease. Subsequently, Harvey Feigenbaum in the 1960s standardized the clinical use of M-mode echocardiography for quantitative assessment of left-ventricular dimensions. The advent of 2-dimensional echocardiography (1970s), pulsed Doppler (1970s), and color Doppler (1980s) introduced new methods for routine assessment of cardiac anatomy and hemodynamics at bedside. Flexible scopes and superior transducers further paved the way to the application of transesophageal echocardiography. Tissue Doppler and contrast echocardiography recently have emerged as important tools for evaluation of regional myocardial function and blood flow. Miniaturization and the ability to pack thousands of crystals in an electronic array have transformed the application of 3-dimensional echocardiography into a bedside tomographic tool. At the current pace of development, echocardiography will be able to provide complete assessment of the heart in terms of its anatomy, coronary flow, and physiology. Training people and making it available at every bedside may be the only remaining challenges.

### Time requirements of the standard echocardiogram: implications regarding limited studies [^115ambNv]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although no formal detailed definitions exist, a standard echocardiogram should easily be differentiated from a limited examination by its comprehensive nature and time requirement.

Objective

We evaluated the time required to perform each specific component of a comprehensive echocardiography examination and applied these data to compare the time required to complete 3 limited imaging protocols.

Methods

In all, 7 experienced sonographers were timed in their performance of a comprehensive echocardiographic examination on a healthy patient. A total of 3 limited imaging protocols were then constructed to evaluate for pericardial effusion, wall motion, and left ventricle size. The time necessary to complete each protocol was calculated by adding the average time required to perform all of its components and was compared with the comprehensive examination.

Results

The imaging time required to complete a standard study was 26 ± 5.4 minutes (range: 20–32). The percentage of total study time spent on 2-dimensional imaging, M-mode, color Doppler, and spectral components was 31 ± 2.9%, 11 ± 3.6%, 17 ± 2.9%, and 39 ± 5.0%, respectively. The calculated time needed to perform a limited protocol was less than 5 minutes, resulting in a greater than 80% reduction in time compared with the standard examination.

Conclusion

Time analysis of components of the standard echocardiography examination can be used to construct appropriate, time-efficient, limited, cardiac ultrasound imaging examinations and differentiate limited from comprehensive studies.

### Guidelines and standards for performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the task force of the pediatric council of the American Society of Echocardiography [^115PUTqc]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Medium credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — physician expertise levels and scope are defined such that, because TTE is the primary diagnostic imaging modality in children with heart disease, pediatric cardiologists must possess basic skills in performance and interpretation of transthoracic cardiac ultrasound, including M-mode, 2D imaging, and various Doppler methods, and the ACC/American Heart Association/American Academy of Pediatrics training recommendations are incorporated with minor modifications. Physicians who practice TTE may have one of two levels of expertise, core or advanced; the core level includes the basic set of technical and interpretive skills required for graduation from a pediatric cardiology training program accredited by ACGME, and physicians with this level are expected to be able to perform and interpret TTEs in normal infants, children, and adolescents, and in those with childhood heart disease with consultation as needed. Advanced is a high level of expertise in all aspects of pediatric echocardiography, and physicians with this level are expected to be able to perform independently and to interpret echocardiograms in patients with all forms of congenital and acquired pediatric heart disease, and to supervise and train others.

General principles for standard pediatric transthoracic echocardiography — Standard pediatric TTE should provide comprehensive anatomic data and quantitative evaluation of ventricular function and cardiovascular physiology, composed of 2D echocardiographic images with spectral and color Doppler and potentially including M-mode, TDI, 3DE, and strain. Examiners should understand the indication, address management issues, and consider patient position, comfort, anxiety, and stability; evaluate abnormal structures or flow jets and assess for pulmonary hypertension; exclude pericardial effusion from multiple views, especially after cardiac surgery; and the protocol may include assessment for pleural effusion, abnormal diaphragmatic motion, extracardiac structures such as the thymus, and mediastinal abnormalities that should be reported.

Echocardiography Equipment and Archiving

Echocardiography equipment used for training purposes should have B-mode (2D), M-mode, pulsed wave, continuous wave, and color Doppler facilities. Tissue Doppler imaging capability is not a prerequisite for training. Electrocardiogram tracing capability is also an essential component that should be used on all scans. A range of probes should be available to cater for a wide range of infant sizes. A dedicated work station with an archiving system for image storage and offline review in the vicinity of the NICU is required to facilitate study storage, review, and reporting. Reporting of echocardiography examinations should be formalized and standardized. Studies undertaken for teaching purposes should be reported as such.

Stress echocardiography imaging priorities and contrast effects — When indications are chest pain and dyspnea, including known or suspected coronary artery disease, it is important to prioritize the collection of 2D images for wall motion analysis. If echocardiographic contrast is used for LV cavity opacification, tissue Doppler signals are not useful and only TR velocity can be of value; the provider can consider two separate tests in this setting, and whether contrast is used or not, one should proceed immediately after treadmill exercise is terminated to acquire 2D images.

Newer echocardiographic modalities in pediatrics — The recent advent of echocardiographic modalities such as Doppler imaging of tissue velocities, including strain and strain rate imaging, color M-mode assessment of atrioventricular valve inflows, and live 3-dimensional echocardiography portends great promise for the near future. The quantitative approaches available from the application of these modalities promise to provide a new paradigm for the echocardiographic assessment of myocardial and valvar function, and other innovative technologies, such as handheld echocardiography scanners, may expand the applicability of pediatric echocardiography; however, this document does not seek to establish standards for these newer modalities.

### Principles of transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation [^11645H9h]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography is the most widely used imaging test in cardiology. Although completely noninvasive, transthoracic echocardiography has a well-established role in the diagnosis of numerous cardiovascular diseases, and also provides critical qualitative and quantitative information on their prognosis and pathophysiological processes. The aim of this Review is to outline the broad principles of transthoracic echocardiography, including the traditional techniques of two-dimensional, colour, and spectral Doppler echocardiography, and newly developed advances including tissue Doppler, myocardial deformation imaging, torsion, stress echocardiography, contrast and three-dimensional echocardiography. The advantages and disadvantages, clinical application, prognostic value, and salient research findings of each modality are described. Advances in complex imaging techniques are expected to continue unabated, and this Review highlights technical improvements that will influence the diagnosis and improve our understanding of cardiovascular function and disease.

Color Doppler imaging settings and optimization — recommended actions include: "First optimize the 2D sector size, then add the color Doppler ROI sized appropriately to show the flow information being evaluated". "Set color gain just below the level of random speckle" and adjust throughout the exam. "Select a standard map for the laboratory at a consistent default scale setting (50–70 cm/sec)… In low-flow settings, adjust the velocity scale downward to better display the color Doppler image". Additionally, "several ultrasound systems also offer an automatic ultrasound optimization feature for color-flow Doppler settings", and "This feature permits automatic adjustment of the color scale and gain to help optimize color-flow Doppler images rapidly".

### Surgical echocardiography of heart valves: a primer for the cardiovascular surgeon [^111YrBUX]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Echocardiography is the primary noninvasive tool for evaluating the structure and function of cardiac valves and has become an essential diagnostic test in pre-, intra-, and postoperative management. Standard echocardiogram reports include several measurements and findings important to most cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgeons. These measurements are derived from multiple standard imaging techniques, such as M-mode, 2-dimensional (2D), spectral Doppler and color Doppler which are employed in transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography. As an ensemble, these techniques provide a comprehensive assessment of primary valve pathology and its secondary effects. In this review, we describe the use of these techniques in the imaging of the mitral, aortic, tricuspid and pulmonic valves. In addition, we highlight the clinical uses of real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) to evaluate valvular pathology, and the emerging use of a new matrix array 3D TEE probe.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^1167Ztex]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for research studies and clinical trials — acquisition and interpretation of echocardiograms for research purposes in hypertension poses some special challenges with a significant learning curve, and quality improved over time in a Framingham cohort: in M‑mode echocardiograms performed in over 6000 subjects aged 17–90, the ability to record acceptable quality echocardiograms in subjects older than 60 years rose from a minimum of 28% during the first 5 months of the study to a maximum of 74–81% during studies 2 years later; hence, echocardiography 'drop‑outs' may not be randomly distributed and two‑dimensional echocardiographic measurements were even more problematic than 2D‑guided M‑mode. Extensive previous clinical experience in echocardiography was no guarantee of high‑quality echocardiograms for research purposes, monitoring of study quality is important, the inclusion of 'control' subjects is a protection against apparent changes due only to regression to the mean, and the use of sample echocardiograms is a means of ensuring common methodology and to prevent 'drift' over time; the role of imaging in these settings is unproven and warrants further study.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) limitations in ventricular function assessment — The ventricular apex can be foreshortened, and if unnoticed this can result in underestimation of ventricular volumes; because Doppler beam alignment is challenging, particularly of the aortic valve (AV), Doppler-based ventricular function indices may not be as accurate with TEE, and the limited imaging planes and lack of normative data for TEE limit the use of standard M-mode, B-mode, and Doppler-based methods used in transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

### Guidelines and standards for performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the task force of the pediatric council of the American Society of Echocardiography [^114QuprW]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Medium credibility.

Examination protocol — examination principles for pediatric echocardiography state that standard examinations involve 2D images supplemented by Doppler and color Doppler in multiple orthogonal imaging planes, and studies are organized by acoustic windows. A complete examination protocol should outline all views to be obtained, including their preferred order, the imaging modalities to be deployed for each view, and the preferred methods for recording and display, with required versus optional measurements clearly defined. Many laboratories begin with subxiphoid, or subcostal, imaging instead of left parasternal views to determine and display visceral situs at the beginning of an examination, and regardless of where the examination starts, the segmental approach is used to describe all of the major cardiovascular structures in sequence; abnormal findings must be fully examined and quantification of ventricular function is often an important part. For orientation, by convention the anterior and superior structures are displayed at the top of the video screen and rightward structures on the left side, so the preferred method of display is with the image apex "inverted", with the apex at the bottom of the video screen during subxiphoid and apical imaging; the one exception is the parasternal long-axis view, in which the apex is displayed on the left side in both levocardia and dextrocardia. Diagnostic accuracy depends greatly on image quality, so technical adjustments to improve signal-to-noise ratio and image resolution, selection of the appropriate probe and optimal transducer frequency with adjustment of electronic focus depth, centering structures with appropriate magnification, optimizing windows for imaging and Doppler interrogation, and attention to patient position, comfort, and anxiety are emphasized; as the examination progresses, the sonographer or echocardiographer must keep in mind indications and issues that may affect treatment, and custom, or in-between, planes may be required to investigate or display an abnormality.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted interpretation of systolic function by echocardiogram [^112dLwYY]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Level 1 skill in echocardiography refers to the minimum level of competency required to perform and interpret basic echocardiographic examinations for diagnostic purposes. This level of competency is achieved after completing a dedicated period of training, typically lasting 3 months. During this training period, the trainee is expected to develop a thorough understanding of functional anatomy and physiology in relation to the echocardiographic examination. In addition to theoretical training, the trainee is required to participate in the interpretation of a minimum of 150 complete echocardiographic examinations, including M-mode, 2D and Doppler studies.

Protocol 1

To assess the accuracy of AI-estimated LVEF for each case, we compared the AI-LVEF to the reference LVEF value, which was calculated from an average of the assessments by the five expert readers as a ground truth. We used our previously developed AI model to estimate LVEF for this study. To obtain the reference LVEF values, all studies were independently analysed by five expert readers with more than 10 years' experience with echocardiography as well as certification as Registered Medical Sonographers or Board Certificated Fellows by The Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine. LVEF was calculated by the biplane method of disks using the AP2 and AP4 views, and then the measurement was confirmed on the other echocardiographic views (AP3, PLAX and PSAX). The HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) was defined as the clinical diagnosis of HF with LVEF < 50%, whereas an HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) was the clinical diagnosis of HF with LVEF ≥ 50%, as based on the current American Society of Echocardiography (ASE)/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) guidelines.

Credentials of NPE Trainers

As stated above, directing, coordinating, and conducting training should be done by neonatologists with an extensive expertise in NPE. Currently, no formal certification in NPE for trainer or trainees exists. Therefore, NPE trainers should possess a skill set that is sufficient for independent scanning and facilitates training: Trainers should be able to obtain all the required echocardiography views (in B-mode (2D), M-Mode, and color Doppler), be competent in confirming normal structural anatomy, identifying pathology, and be fully competent in performing all the functional modalities outlined in the TNE/NoPE guidelines. Familiarity and knowledge of advanced functional techniques including tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking echocardiography is not essential but is desirable. Other key elements should include the following:
A 12-mo period of exposure to neonates with CHD under the supervision of a designated consultant pediatric cardiologist. This period can be feasibly carried out in a tertiary neonatal center fulfilling the criteria outlined above. Although time in a pediatric heart center is not essential, it may be of great benefit for further exposure to CHD.
NPE trainers should have a designated and established link with a consultant pediatric cardiologist who endorses the echocardiography skills of the trainer and should maintain a logbook of scans and report on a standard template. Regular meetings to discuss cases and review trainee progress with pediatric cardiology are essential.
NPE trainers should carry out at least 50 echocardiograms per annum themselves to demonstrate maintenance of competency. Those scans should be functional in nature in structurally normal hearts and not for the purpose of diagnosis of CHD. We understand that some neonatologists across Europe do perform echocardiography to rule out CHD, but this practice is beyond the scope of this consensus statement.
NPE trainers should have dedicated time allocated to training oversight on a weekly basis.

### New insights into regional systolic and diastolic left ventricular function with tissue Doppler echocardiography: from qualitative analysis to a quantitative approach [^1118mhws]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2001). Low credibility.

Tissue Doppler echocardiography is a variation of conventional Doppler flow imaging. This modality allows quantification of the Doppler shift within the range of myocardial tissue motion. The velocity at a variety of myocardial sites can be determined and distinguished very rapidly by using Doppler techniques. The velocity of moving tissue can be studied with pulsed wave tissue Doppler sampling, which displays the velocity of a selected myocardial region against time, with high temporal resolution. In addition, the velocities can be calculated with time-velocity maps and displayed as color-encoded velocity maps in either an M-mode or 2-dimensional format. This review will focus on the technical aspects and the different methods of tissue Doppler echocardiography for the analysis of regional systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. Whereas pulsed wave tissue Doppler echocardiography allows measurements of velocities of a selected myocardial region, color tissue Doppler gives the best overview of cardiac dynamics because the entire scanned color data are displayed simultaneously. However, there is an increasing need for objective evaluation of tissue Doppler information. Digital images and postprocessing of the data allow for quantitative off-line analysis, and the different approaches and parameters proposed from different centers are discussed.

### A practical approach to the echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic function [^116aWehB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2004). Low credibility.

A number of recent community-based epidemiologic studies suggest that 40% to 50% of the cases of heart failure have preserved left ventricular systolic function. Although diastolic heart failure is often not well clinically recognized, it is associated with marked increases in morbidity and all-cause mortality. Doppler echocardiography has emerged as the principal clinical tool for the assessment of left ventricular diastolic function. Doppler mitral inflow velocity-derived variables remain the cornerstone of the evaluation of diastolic function. Pulmonary venous Doppler flow indices and mitral inflow measurements with Valsalva's maneuver are important adjuncts for differentiating normal and pseudonormal mitral inflow patterns. Unfortunately, these Doppler flow variables are significantly influenced by loading conditions and, therefore, the results from these standard techniques can be inconclusive. Recently, color M-mode and Doppler tissue imaging have emerged as new modalities that are less affected by preload and, thus, provide a strong complementary role in the assessment of diastolic function. This review will discuss the diastolic properties of the left ventricle, Doppler echocardiographic evaluation, and grading of diastolic dysfunction.

Continuous-wave Doppler — equipment selection — notes that CW Doppler samples the entire range of returning frequencies along its beam path and cannot discern where any particular frequency shift is located; for maximum sensitivity, it is recommended that the small-footprint specialized nonimaging (pulsed echo Doppler flow) transducer be used for clinical situations in which it is critical to obtain maximum flow velocity.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^111RqHeY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular mass (LV mass) quantification in adults by echocardiography — measurement timing, methods, and calculation considerations — includes that measurements should be performed at the end of diastole (the frame before mitral valve closure or the frame in the cardiac cycle in which the ventricular dimension or volume is largest). Methods include M‑mode, two‑dimensional echocardiography (2DE), and three‑dimensional echocardiography (3DE); M‑mode and 2D linear dimensions use geometric formulas to estimate myocardial volume while 3DE can measure it directly, and all methods convert volume to mass using myocardial density (approximately 1.05 g/mL). When using 2D images of the entire ventricle, either the area‑length or truncated ellipsoid technique is used. Proper technique requires wall thickness and LV dimensions be perpendicular to the long axis, and 2D‑guided M‑mode or 2D image measurements are preferred over blind M‑mode imaging. The commonly used formula includes a correction for the 20% overestimation from original M‑mode validation and raises the linear dimensions to the power of 3, so small dimensional errors can significantly affect calculated LV mass; moreover, because direct 2D wall thickness measures may be smaller than M‑mode, LV mass values derived with this formula may not be directly interchangeable. For serial assessment in individual patients, 2D echocardiographic methods have advantages over linear dimensions, whereas for screening or studying large populations, the M‑mode method has advantages because it is simple, quick, and subject to less measurement variability. Because 3DE directly measures myocardial volume, it is an appropriate approach, but it is the consensus of this committee that available 3D echocardiographic LV mass data in normal subjects are not sufficient to recommend normal reference values. In patients with upper septal hypertrophy, linear dimension methods using basal measurements result in overestimation of the true mass.

Key points for fetal echocardiography — performance standards and timing — state that fetal echocardiography must be performed using appropriate equipment and in observance of the principle of "as low as reasonably achievable", that existing guidelines for storage and documentation must be followed, that two-dimensional, spectral Doppler, and color Doppler echocardiographic modalities should be used with imaging settings optimized specifically for the fetal heart examination, and that standard views and imaging planes should be used; minimum standards for 2D, spectral Doppler, and color Doppler static and dynamic image capture including fetal position, cardiac structure and function, and cardiac biometry must be met; fetal echocardiography can be performed earlier than 18 weeks and should be considered for patients presenting in the late first trimester with suspicion for cardiac anomaly, depending on local resources and expertise; and there is insufficient evidence to recommend early (< 16 weeks) fetal echocardiography for low-risk pregnancies, but it has been shown to be feasible and may be used for high-risk pregnancies or those with known abnormal screening findings.

General assumptions — initial outpatient pediatric transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): This document will address the initial use of outpatient TTE during pediatric (≤ 18 years of age) outpatient care and will not address the use of TTE in patients with previously known structural, functional, or primary electrical cardiac abnormalities. A comprehensive TTE examination may include 2-dimensional, M-mode, and 3-dimensional imaging as well as spectral and color Doppler evaluation, and a comprehensive TTE report includes interpretation of all aspects of the TTE. The use of transesophageal or stress echocardiography will not be addressed in this document. The document assumes that any other more definitive diagnostic test, including but not limited to electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, or genetic testing, when appropriate will be considered prior to ordering a TTE.

### EAE / ASE recommendations for image acquisition and display using three-dimensional echocardiography [^111Egwq2]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Medium credibility.

Transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) protocol — 3DE data sets should be acquired from multiple transthoracic transducer positions, and in clinical practice two protocols have been used: focused examination and complete examination. For a focused exam, start with 2D imaging to localize the structure of interest, then switch to live 3DE imaging to check if the structure of interest is encompassed within the volume of interest, and then obtain a 3D acquisition in the full-volume or zoom mode. If the patient is unable to hold the respiration during a gated multibeat acquisition or if significant rhythm disturbances are present, use single-beat full-volume acquisition (if available) or use narrow-angled 3D acquisition mode, and last, select the highest resolution option that accommodates the volume of interest. A complete 3D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) exam requires multiple acquisitions from the parasternal, apical, subcostal, and suprasternal transducer positions, and Table 2 lists the 2D TTE views from which 3DE data sets should be acquired.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive pediatric transthoracic echocardiogram: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^114SkEGB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) modalities and scope — Two-dimensional echocardiography, M-mode, and Doppler evaluation continue to be the mainstay of pediatric TTE, but the armamentarium of adjunct diagnostic tools has expanded to include 3DE, STE, and the use of contrast agents. In addition, improvements in transducer technology and image processing as well as continued development of more robust and effective artificial intelligence algorithms have broadened the capabilities of TTE to provide accurate and reliable anatomic and physiologic information for children with heart disease. In developing this update to the 2006 and 2010 documents, there has been significant effort to distinguish between guidelines as practices that should be performed and additional or adjunct recommendations as practices that may be performed during a comprehensive pediatric TTE and to avoid describing practices that must be part of an examination, and these recommendations result from a consensus of expert opinions based on published pediatric guidelines, reports of studies involving pediatric and congenital echocardiography, and clinical experience. Although it is not discussed in this document because it is not an adjunct modality during standard pediatric TTE, transthoracic stress echocardiography is gaining increased use in children, particularly in the setting of valve disease, CA abnormalities, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and after heart transplantation, and minimal guidelines for its use and interpretation in pediatrics are included in the ASE stress echocardiography guidelines and standards for adults, but detailed recommendations have not yet been published. In the current era, pediatric TTE is still limited in its ability to provide accurate data as it relates to cardiac output, relative flow between the pulmonary and systemic vascular beds, pulmonary vascular disease, and valve disease, and in addition, many echocardiographic parameters used routinely in adult echocardiography have not yet been validated for children and pediatric disease. Further research in children is needed for these and other areas, particularly in terms of the relationship between echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcomes in acquired and CHD, assessment of diastolic function in general, quantification of systolic and diastolic function for the right ventricle and the single ventricle, use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in pediatric echocardiography, and pediatric applications of strain imaging and contrast echocardiography.

Curved M‑mode strain rate imaging — feasibility and clinical value are described as follows: Visual assessment of curved M‑mode images utilizes the information provided by strain rate imaging without the requirement for time consuming, detailed analysis of strain rate plots, and the M‑mode technique has higher feasibility than quantitative Doppler strain imaging. A limited number of studies have shown that visual assessment of curved M‑mode images has supplemental diagnostic and prognostic value to visual assessment of wall motion. Curved M‑mode images can be easily obtained following completion of the stress exam on images where two‑dimensional (2D) and TDI information were simultaneously acquired; however, the process of deriving these images and arranging them for physician review takes several minutes, and further validation is required. Visual assessment of cardiac motion should be used to distinguish artifact from true abnormalities in strain rate.

Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) has evolved to become a useful noninvasive method that can complement other echocardiographic techniques in the assessment of left ventricular myocardial velocities in a variety of clinical conditions. Color 2-dimensional and color M-mode TDI are used for quantification of systolic myocardial velocities during myocardial ischemia at rest and with pharmacologic stress testing. Spectral pulsed TDI can provide measurements of regional systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities, and it is particularly useful in the identification of abnormalities of left ventricular diastolic relaxation. This review summarizes the clinical applications of TDI to promote understanding of its utility in the evaluation of left ventricular myocardial function.

Basic Echocardiography Training

By the end of the basic NPE training phase, the candidate should be able to demonstrate competent operation of the echocardiography machine and should have the ability to use appropriate probes, optimize images, and adequately store and archive completed studies. In addition, the candidate should be capable of adequately acquiring all of the basic echocardiographic views, perform pulsed wave, continuous wave, and color Doppler interrogation as appropriate, use M-mode echocardiography to measure basic function and wall dimensions, and be capable of demonstrating normal structural anatomy of the heart.

The candidate should be able to communicate those findings to an NPE trainer and compose a written report of the findings. The candidate should not independently utilize NPE to guide clinical decisions during the basic training phase. Following completion of the basic training, the echocardiograms performed by the candidate can be used to guide clinical management once reviewed by an NPE trainer. We emphasize on strengthening clinical governance by reviewing these studies in departmental echocardiography meetings, which should be led by an advanced NPE trainer. Echocardiography simulators can be very valuable in the early part of training, especially for the assessment of basic echocardiographic views, without having to interfere with the patient's homeostasis. Also the identification of structural abnormalities can be trained on a simulator. It is evident that echocardiography simulators can never replace live patient scanning. Moreover, it is of the upmost importance that good quality simulators are used. It is recommended that available echocardiography models are evaluated prospectively in their feasibility in NPE training. We propose the following key elements that are required to complete the basic echocardiography training phase:
Complete, log, archive, and report > 100 complete NPE studies over a 6-mo period. Part of these scans may be performed on a neonatal echocardiography simulator (limited to 50). It is emphasized that the number of a hundred scans is an absolute minimum requirement, and the NPE trainer can decide that a candidate needs more scans to become competent in image acquisition and relating the findings to the clinical scenario, especially if a simulator is used for some of the scans.
Studies performed during the initial training period while becoming acquainted with the machine and probe positioning do not form part of those 100 studies.
At least 70% of those studies should be in infants with normal structural anatomy (including PDA/patent foramen ovale). Infants with a functional pathology, such as PDA, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, impaired myocardial performance, pericardial effusion et cetera are included in this 70% group, as are assessments of intravascular catheter position.
A minimum of 15 of those studies should be in infants with CHD (other than PDA/patent foramen ovale), with at least 10 during the early neonatal period. Those scans should all be reviewed with a pediatric cardiologist or an NPE trainer.

### Targeted neonatal echocardiography in the neonatal intensive care unit: practice guidelines and recommendations for training. writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) in collaboration with the European association of echocardiography (EAE) and the association for European pediatric cardiologists (AEPC) [^115GFZ2m]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Targeted neonatal echocardiography (TNE) training competencies — core and advanced levels define cognitive knowledge and practical skills. Core training emphasizes understanding "the physics of ultrasound and its practical applications" and "the physiology of the fetal and neonatal transitional circulation", along with neonatal-specific practice such as "Special precautions for scanning neonates, such as temperature stability, infection prevention, minimal touch approach, and limiting scan times". Core practical skills include obtaining "the standard pediatric views (subxiphoid, parasternal, apical, and suprasternal) and know how interpret the images", using Doppler modalities — "Use of pulsed-wave Doppler, continuous-wave Doppler, and color Doppler to demonstrate blood flow velocities; knowledge of normal velocity patterns" — and quantitative imaging — "Knowledge of the use M-mode and 2D echocardiography to measure wall thickness and chamber dimensions and calculation of FS and EF" — with communication skills to "produce a written report". Advanced TNE training adds capability to "Be able to rule out structural CHD", apply "more advanced Doppler applications and tissue Doppler techniques; interpretation of abnormal findings", and perform hemodynamic assessments — "Know how to assess the hemodynamic importance of pericardial fluid", "Know how to assess pulmonary artery arterial hypertension in newborns" — as well as procedural imaging — "Know how to image central lines and identification of endocarditis" — and participation in quality systems — "Participate in echocardiography laboratory quality management programs with review of results and diagnostic errors".

Strain and three-dimensional echocardiography — capabilities with stress: Strain and strain rate imaging using Doppler and 2D echocardiography-based techniques permit quantification of regional function with stress, and further protocol and software refinements will enhance clinical application. Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography using matrix-array transducers allows rapid acquisition of a 3-dimensional data set with stress that can be sliced to visualize multiple 2D views of the left ventricle (LV), enabling assessment of segments not routinely seen with 2D scanners. The ability to obtain multiple 2D views permits exact matching of baseline and stress views, which may be important for detecting limited wall-motion abnormalities. The feasibility of real-time 3-dimensional stress echocardiography has been documented, and continued improvements in image quality will likely increase its use.

Training Requirements

Introduction to Echocardiography Concepts (Pretraining Phase)

Candidates undertaking an NPE training program should partake in a pretraining phase aimed to prepare the candidate for carrying out echocardiograms. A thorough and comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology, and hemodynamics, as it applies to neonatal health and disease, is essential as NPE should always be taken in the clinical context and used to guide clinical management. In addition, the candidate should demonstrate an understanding of the physics and principles of ultrasound, pulsed wave, continuous wave, and color Doppler. In order to aid in image acquisition during the practical training phase, the candidate should become familiar with all the necessary echocardiography views required to perform a standard NPE study including M-mode imaging and its use in functional echocardiography. There are a variety of print and online multimedia resources available to facilitate this pretraining phase (Table 1). Attendance at an echocardiography course is also encouraged. The use of echocardiography simulators when available may also be a valuable aid to learning.

Echocardiographic maneuvers for diastolic assessment — acquisition and analysis parameters include the following: For the Valsalva maneuver, obtain a continuous recording through peak inspiration and during forced expiration for 10 sec with mouth and nose closed, and analyze the change in MV E velocity and E/A ratio during peak strain and following release. For color M‑mode Vp, analyze the slope of inflow from the MV plane into the LV chamber during early diastole at 4‑cm distance. For IVRT and for time‑interval measurements such as T E‑e′, sweep speed should be 100 mm/sec, and for T E‑e′ the interval is calculated by subtracting the time from QRS to e′ from the time from R wave to onset of mitral E velocity. All Doppler and M‑mode recordings are preferably acquired at a sweep speed of 100 mm/sec.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular diastolic function — recommended variables and interpretation are as follows: The four recommended variables and abnormal cutoffs are annular e′ velocity (septal e′ < 7 cm/sec, lateral e′ < 10 cm/sec), average E/e′ ratio > 14, LA volume index > 34 mL/m^2, and peak TR velocity > 2.8 m/sec. LV diastolic function is normal if more than half of the available variables do not meet these cutoff values, diastolic dysfunction is present if more than half meet them, and the study is inconclusive if half meet them. Average E/e′ ratio is recommended for simplification, and when only one annulus is available a lateral E/e′ ratio > 13 or a septal E/e′ > 15 is considered abnormal. LA maximum volume index is recommended rather than LA anteroposterior diameter by M‑mode.

Echocardiographic evaluation content for PHV — Doppler and reporting: "Echocardiographic evaluation of PHV should be a comprehensive, integrative approach, utilizing multiple echo views and angulations, including off-axis angles to acquire 2-dimensional, Doppler (color, pulse, and continuous wave), M-mode, and 3-dimensional images with and without color". Using these tools, echo "can often visualize the PHV leaflet motion, presence or absence of bioprosthetic leaflet thickening, calcification, or masses (thrombus and vegetation), stability of the PHV sewing ring, and flow through and around the valve". "Color Doppler interrogation of the PHV is engaged for assessment of presence or absence of PHV regurgitation", and it "helps identify the presence, location (central vs. paravalvular), and severity of regurgitant jets". A complete assessment "must include chamber size and function, wall thickness, intracardiac pressure estimation, and assessment of adjacent valve function", and "Echocardiographic template reporting should include the PHV type, size, date of implant"

Spectral versus color Doppler velocities — The time course of a spectral Doppler velocity curve is similar to a color Doppler–derived one, but absolute values differ because color Doppler approximates the mean velocity of a region and reported pulsed Doppler peak velocity is typically 20% to 30% higher than that measured by color Doppler. Accordingly, it is recommended that the modal velocity be used for pulsed Doppler measurements.

### Anatomic M-mode, a pertinent tool for the daily practice of transthoracic echocardiography [^117CGirR]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to compare anatomic M-mode (AMM), a new echocardiographic postprocessing option, and conventional M-mode (CMM) using fundamental imaging and tissue harmonic imaging.

Methods

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 15 selected patients to analyze the reproducibility of AMM and in 47 patients to assess its clinical value versus CMM. Acquisitions were performed successively: CMM fundamental imaging; CMM tissue harmonic imaging; tissue harmonic imaging cineloops for AMM; and fundamental imaging cineloops for AMM. Quantitative analysis was performed offline. The angle alpha between the CMM line and the septal endocardial interface was calculated and the expected percentage of error in measuring left ventricular diameter was derived.

Results

AMM analysis was reproducible. Optimal AMM full echocardiographic definition was obtainable in 77% of the population, whereas CMM was optimal for 49% because of scan line misalignment, causing a measurement overestimation exceeding 5%.

Conclusion

The ability with AMM to reduce the alpha angle to 0 degrees and, thus, avoid overestimation of left ventricular dimensions might improve follow-up in several pathologic conditions.

Echocardiography

A two-dimensional (2D), M-mode and Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiographic examination was performed in the left lateral decubitas position by a consultant cardiologist using a commercially available ultrasound system (Philips, USA). Images of the heart were obtained in the standard parasternal long-axis and short-axis and apical four-chamber planes, as previously described, in order to identify subtle focal regions of abnormal LV hypertrophy. The LV wall thickness was measured from 2D short-axis views in end-diastole, with the greatest measurement within the LV wall defined as the maximal wall thickness. M-mode echocardiograms derived from 2D images in the parasternal long axis were used for the measurement of LV end-diastolic diameter (LVIDd) and LV end-systolic (LVIDs) dimensions, left atrial diameter and aortic root diameter according to American Society of Echocardiography standards, with LV volumes (diastolic and systolic) derived using Simpson's biplane methodology. Left ventricular mass was calculated using the formula of Devereux. Three to five consecutive measurements were taken, and the average was calculated. Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed using pulsed-wave Doppler recordings from apical four-chamber orientations. A 4 mm sample volume was placed at the tips of the mitral leaflets in diastole and transmitral flow was acquired to obtain peak early (E) and atrial (A) flow velocities. All data was analysed offline and a minimum of three cardiac cycles were averaged for all indices. For the tissue Doppler assessment of E', the apical four-chamber orientation was utilised and a 2 mm sample volume was positioned at both the septal and lateral wall aspect of the mitral valve annulus ensuring the best alignment between wall motion and the ultrasound beam. The high-pass filter was bypassed and gains set to a minimal value to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio. The nyquist limit was set between 10 and 35 cm/s. Peak early diastolic (E') tissue myocardial velocity was recorded and E/E' was calculated.

Recommendations

Individuals with MPS should undergo physical examination, echocardiography and 12-lead ECG at the time of diagnosis, followed by regular monitoring (every 1 to 2 years for MPS I and VI, or 1 to 3 years for MPS II) thereafter in order to provide appropriate diagnosis and management (Giugliani et al; Muenzer et al.). Additional cardiac evaluations should be considered before major operative interventions. Complete evaluation includes right arm and leg blood pressure measurements, careful auscultation, performance of a full transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiogram, 12-lead ECG, and Holter monitoring as indicated (Giugliani et al; Muenzer et al.). Performance and interpretation of echocardiography should be standardized (in terms of equipment and settings) and provided by individuals familiar with expected pathological findings in patients with MPS (Fig. 6).

Transmit frequency refers to the operating frequency of the imaging transducer, and in adult echocardiography the typical range is 2.0 to 5.0 MHz; higher frequencies produce better image resolution but are unable to penetrate as deep into the body as lower frequencies, and with the availability of broad-bandwidth transducers, it is now relatively widely possible to modify transmit frequency rapidly.

### Use of high-frame rate imaging and Doppler tissue echocardiography in the diagnosis of fetal ventricular tachycardia [^111ioC9z]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2001). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia has rarely been diagnosed in the fetus. We describe a 31-week-old fetus with ventricular tachycardia and severely depressed ventricular function. M-mode and 2-dimensional Doppler tissue echocardiography were used in this study to assess the nature of the arrhythmia. The complete atrioventricular dissociation inherent to the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia was particularly easy to detect with M-mode Doppler tissue echocardiography. Moreover, the onset and the pattern of propagation of the ventricular arrhythmia could be easily identified with 2-dimensional Doppler tissue echocardiography. Doppler tissue echocardiography facilitates the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia and adds new information that is not available by other techniques.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to evaluation of unexplained syncope, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain 2D and Doppler echocardiography during exercise in the standing, sitting, or semi-supine position to detect provocable LVOTO in patients with HCM, history of syncope, and a resting or provoked peak instantaneous LVOT gradient < 50 mmHg.

### Hydrodynamics of color M-mode Doppler flow wave propagation velocity V (p): a computer study [^1125zGF9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2002). Low credibility.

This study was designed to show the hydrodynamic mechanism of left ventricular (LV) flow wave propagation and to relate this propagated velocity to 2-dimensional (2D) color and color M-mode Doppler echocardiograms. A computer model is developed describing 3-dimensional axisymmetrical LV filling flow. The unsteady Navier-Stokes flow equations are solved in an LV truncated ellipsoid geometry with moving LV walls, including relaxation and compliance of the wall. The computed results confirm both intraventricular flow and pressure patterns during filling. Vortices are formed during the acceleration phases of the early and atrial filling waves. During the deceleration phases, the vortices are amplified and convected into the ventricle. The vortices are recognized on the derived 2D color echocardiograms as in vivo. The propagation of this vortex determines the propagation of the maximum velocity observed in the color M-mode Doppler echocardiogram. For pseudonormal filling of the left ventricle, the LV flow wave propagation velocity decreases.

### Non-Doppler two-dimensional strain imaging by echocardiography – from technical considerations to clinical applications [^114xYQTB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Low credibility.

During the past several years, strain and strain rate imaging have emerged as a quantitative technique to accurately estimate myocardial function and contractility. Non-Doppler, 2-dimensional (2D) strain imaging is a new echocardiographic technique for obtaining strain and strain rate measurements. It analyzes motion by tracking speckles in the ultrasonic image in two dimensions. Current available software allows spatial and temporal image processing with recognition and selection of such elements on ultrasound image. The geometric shift of each speckle represents local tissue movement. By tracking theses speckles, 2D tissue velocity, strain, and strain rate can be calculated. Non-Doppler 2D strain imaging is simple to perform. It requires only one cardiac cycle to be acquired; further processing and interpretation can be done after image data acquisition. Because it is not based on tissue Doppler measurements, it is angle independent. Data regarding accuracy, validity, and clinical application of non-Doppler 2D strain imaging are rapidly accumulating. This technique may prove to be of significant clinical value, enabling rapid and accurate assessment of global and segmental myocardial function.

### Transcranial… [^115tTkmL]. Wikipedia (2014). Low credibility.

Doppler ultrasonography is medical ultrasonography that employs the Doppler effect to perform imaging of the movement of tissues and body fluids, and their relative velocity to the probe. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example, flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualized. Duplex ultrasonography sometimes refers to Doppler ultrasonography or spectral Doppler ultrasonography. Doppler ultrasonography consists of two components: brightness mode showing anatomy of the organs, and Doppler mode superimposed on the B-mode. Meanwhile, spectral Doppler ultrasonography consists of three components: B-mode, Doppler mode, and spectral waveform displayed at the lower half of the image. Therefore, "duplex ultrasonography" is a misnomer for spectral Doppler ultrasonography, and more exact name should be "triplex ultrasonography".

Operation Colour Doppler shows the direction of the blood flow in red or blue. Meanwhile, spectral Doppler not only shows the direction of blood flow, it also shows the phases and acceleration of the blood flow. Any sudden changes in direction of blood flow produces audible sounds on the ultrasound machine. In spectral Doppler, the y-axis shows the direction and velocity of the flow. Meanwhile, the x-axis shows the flow over time. The gradient at any point on the waveform would therefore shows the acceleration of the flow. In "antegrade" flow, the blood flows according to the normal flow within the circulatory system. In jugular venous pressure waveform of the internal jugular vein, the retrograde "a" waveform is a normal flow due to right atrium contraction.

Both antegrade or retrograde flow can be either towards or away from the probe transducer, depending on the position of the probe relative to the blood flow. Blood flow toward the transducer would appear above the baseline while blood flows away from the transducer will appear below the baseline. Waveform of the flow can be classified as: pulsatile, phasic, non-phasic, and aphasic. Spectral broadening increases from large vessels to medium vessels to small/stenotic/diseased vessels due to a larger variety of blood with different ranges of velocities in those with turbulent flow. Power Doppler is a non directional Doppler. All modern ultrasound scanners use pulsed Doppler to measure velocity. Pulsed wave instruments transmit and receive series of pulses.

The frequency shift of each pulse is ignored, however the relative phase changes of the pulses are used to obtain the frequency shift. The major advantage of pulsed wave Doppler over continuous wave is that distance information is obtained and gain correction is applied. The disadvantage of pulsed Doppler is that the measurements can suffer from aliasing. The terms Doppler ultrasound and Doppler sonography have been accepted to apply to both pulsed and continuous Doppler systems, despite the different mechanisms by which the velocity is measured. There are no standards for displaying color Doppler. Some laboratories show arteries as red and veins as blue, as medical illustrators usually show them, even though some vessels may have portions flowing toward and portions flowing away from the transducer.

### Doppler echocardiography [^114WYhL1]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Although "Doppler" has become synonymous with "velocity measurement" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift. However, the calculation result will end up identical. This procedure is frequently used to examine children's hearts for heart disease because there is no age or size requirement. 2D Doppler imaging Unlike 1D Doppler imaging, which can only provide one-dimensional velocity and has dependency on the beam to flow angle, 2D velocity estimation using Doppler ultrasound is able to generate velocity vectors with axial and lateral velocity components. 2D velocity is useful even if complex flow conditions such as stenosis and bifurcation exist. There are two major methods of 2D velocity estimation using ultrasound: Speckle tracking and crossed beam Vector Doppler, which are based on measuring the time shifts and phase shifts respectively.

Vector Doppler Vector Doppler is a natural extension of the traditional 1D Doppler imaging based on phase shift. The phase shift is found by taking the autocorrelation between echoes from two consecutive firings. The main idea of Vector Doppler is to divide the transducer into three apertures: one at the center as the transmit aperture and two on each side as the receive apertures. The phase shifts measured from left and right apertures are combined to give the axial and lateral velocity components. The positions and the relative angles between apertures need to be tuned according to the depth of the vessel and the lateral position of the region of interest. The decorrelation is mainly caused by the different velocity of pixels within a speckle, as they do not move as a block. This is less severe when measuring the flow at the center, where the changing rate of the velocity is the lowest. The flow at the center usually has the largest velocity magnitude, called "peak velocity".

It is the most needed information in some cases, such as diagnosing stenosis. There are mainly three methods of finding the best match: SAD, SSD and Cross correlation. Assume \ \) is a pixel in the kernel and \ \) is the mapped pixel shifted by \ \) in the search region. SAD is calculated as: \ = \sum _{i = 1}\sum _{j = 1}|X_{0}-X_{1}| \) SSD is calculated as: \ = \sum _{i = 1}\sum _{j = 1}-X_{1})^{2} \). where \ and \ are the average values of \ \) and \ \) respectively. The \ \) pair that gives the lowest D for SAD and SSD, or the largest ρ for the cross correlation, is selected as the estimation of the movement. The velocity is then calculated as the movement divided by the time difference between the frames.

Usually, the median or average of multiple estimations is taken to give more accurate result. Sub pixel accuracy In ultrasound systems, lateral resolution is usually much lower than the axial resolution. The poor lateral resolution in the B-mode image also results in poor lateral resolution in flow estimation. Therefore, sub pixel resolution is needed to improve the accuracy of the estimation in the lateral dimension. In the meantime, we could reduce the sampling frequency along the axial dimension to save computations and memories if the sub pixel movement is estimated accurately enough. There are generally two kinds of methods to obtain the sub pixel accuracy: interpolation methods, such as parabolic fit, and phase based methods in which the peak lag is found when the phase of the analytic cross correlation function crosses zero. where \ is the cross correlation function and \ is the originally found peak.

### Medical ultrasound [^115bEgNJ]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The imaging mode refers to probe and machine settings that result in specific dimensions of the ultrasound image. Several modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging:

- A-mode: Amplitude mode refers to the mode in which the amplitude of the transducer voltage is recorded as a function of two-way travel time of an ultrasound pulse. A single pulse is transmitted through the body and scatters back to the same transducer element. The voltage amplitudes recorded correlate linearly to acoustic pressure amplitudes. A-mode is one-dimensional.
- B-mode: In brightness mode, an array of transducer elements scans a plane through the body resulting in a two-dimensional image. Each pixel value of the image correlates to voltage amplitude registered from the backscattered signal. The dimensions of B-mode images are voltage as a function of angle and two-way time.
- M-mode: In motion mode, A-mode pulses are emitted in succession.

The backscattered signal is converted to lines of bright pixels, whose brightness linearly correlates to backscattered voltage amplitudes. Each next line is plotted adjacent to the previous, resulting in an image that looks like a B-mode image. The M-mode image dimensions are however voltage as a function of two-way time and recording time. This mode is an ultrasound analogy to streak video recording in high-speed photography. As moving tissue transitions produce backscattering, this can be used to determine the displacement of specific organ structures, most commonly the heart. Most machines convert two-way time to imaging depth using as assumed speed of sound of 1540 m/s. As the actual speed of sound varies greatly in different tissue types, an ultrasound image is therefore not a true tomographic representation of the body. Three-dimensional imaging is done by combining B-mode images, using dedicated rotating or stationary probes. This has also been referred to as C-mode.

An imaging technique refers to a method of signal generation and processing that results in a specific application. Most imaging techniques are operating in B-mode.
- Doppler sonography: This imaging technique makes use of the Doppler effect in detection and measuring moving targets, typically blood.
- Harmonic imaging: backscattered signal from tissue is filtered to comprise only frequency content of at least twice the centre frequency of the transmitted ultrasound. Harmonic imaging used for perfusion detection when using ultrasound contrast agents and for the detection of tissue harmonics. Common pulse schemes for the creation of harmonic response without the need of real-time Fourier analysis are pulse inversion and power modulation.
- B-flow is an imaging technique that digitally highlights moving reflectors while suppressing the signals from the surrounding stationary tissue.

It aims to visualize flowing blood and surrounding stationary tissues simultaneously. It is thus an alternative or complement to Doppler ultrasonography in visualizing blood flow. Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is not an imaging mode. However, for positioning a treatment probe to focus on a specific region of interest, A-mode and B-mode are typically used, often during treatment. Angiology In angiology or vascular medicine, duplex ultrasound is used to diagnose arterial and venous disease. This is particularly important in potential neurologic problems, where carotid ultrasound is commonly used for assessing blood flow and potential or suspected stenosis in the carotid arteries, while transcranial Doppler is used for imaging flow in the intracerebral arteries.

Spectral broadening increases from large vessels to medium vessels to small/stenotic/diseased vessels due to a larger variety of blood with different ranges of velocities in those with turbulent flow. Upstream and downstream stenosis refers to the location of the stenotic site relative to the ultrasound probe. Upstream stenosis means the location of stenosis is located before the ultrasound probe. It causes a marked decrease in peak systolic velocity when compared to end-diastolic velocity, causing marked reduction in resistance index. Meanwhile, downstream stenosis is located after the ultrasound probe. Thus, there is only a slight reduction in peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity, resulting in an increased resistance index. Power Doppler is a non directional Doppler.

### Consequences… [^111xSSBM]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

For waves propagating in vacuum, as is possible for electromagnetic waves or gravitational waves, only the relative velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect in such cases may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, motion of the medium, or any combination thereof.
- \ is the propagation speed of the wave in the medium;
- \ is the speed of the wave receiver relative to the medium. In the formula, \ is added to \ if the receiver is moving towards the source, subtracted if the receiver is moving away from the source;.
- \ is the speed of the wave source relative to the medium.

\ is subtracted from \ if the source is moving towards the receiver, added if the source is moving away from the receiver. \, \, and \ here are not vectors as velocities, but their magnitudes as speeds. This relationship predicts that the observed frequency by the receiver will decrease if the distance between the source and receiver is increasing. Note that the speed of the wave is determined by the medium, not by the speed of the source. If the source approaches the observer at an angle, the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object's emitted frequency.

Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion, and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.
- Stationary sound source produces sound waves at a constant frequency f, and the wave-fronts propagate symmetrically away from the source at a constant speed c. The distance between wave-fronts is the wavelength. All observers will hear the same frequency, which will be equal to the actual frequency of the source where f = f~0~.

As a result, the wave-fronts begin to bunch up on the right side and spread further apart on the left side of the source.
- Now the source is moving at the speed of sound in the medium. The wave fronts in front of the source are now all bunched up at the same point. As a result, an observer in front of the source will detect nothing until the source arrives and an observer behind the source will hear a lower frequency f = ⁠c – 0/c + c⁠ f~0~ = 0. 5 f~0~.
- The sound source has now surpassed the speed of sound in the medium, and is traveling at 1. 4 c. Since the source is moving faster than the sound waves it creates, it actually leads the advancing wavefront. The sound source will pass by a stationary observer before the observer hears the sound. As a result, an observer in front of the source will detect nothing and an observer behind the source will hear a lower frequency f = ⁠c – 0/c + 1. 4c⁠ f~0~ = 
0. 42 f~0~.

### Echocardiography… [^1135b7Dh]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Not only can an echocardiogram create ultrasound images of heart structures, but it can also produce accurate assessment of the blood flowing through the heart by Doppler echocardiography, using pulsed- or continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. This allows assessment of both normal and abnormal blood flow through the heart. Color Doppler, as well as spectral Doppler, is used to visualize any abnormal communications between the left and right sides of the heart, as well as any leaking of blood through the valves, and can also estimate how well the valves open. The Doppler technique can also be used for tissue motion and velocity measurement, by tissue Doppler echocardiography. TTE utilizes several "windows" to image the heart from different perspectives.

Each window has advantages and disadvantages for viewing specific structures within the heart and, typically, numerous windows are utilized within the same study to fully assess the heart. Parasternal long and parasternal short axis windows are taken next to the sternum, the apical two/three/four chamber windows are taken from the apex of the heart, and the subcostal window is taken from underneath the edge of the last rib. TTE utilizes one-, two-, and three-dimensional ultrasound from the different windows. These can be combined with pulse wave or continuous wave Doppler to visualize the velocity of blood flow and structure movements. Images can be enhanced with "contrast" that are typically some sort of micro bubble suspension that reflect the ultrasound waves. TEE, unlike TTE, does not have discrete "windows" to view the heart.

The entire esophagus and stomach can be utilized, and the probe advanced or removed along this dimension to alter the perspective on the heart. Most probes include the ability to deflect the tip of the probe in one or two dimensions to further refine the perspective of the heart. Additionally, the ultrasound crystal is often a two-dimension crystal and the ultrasound plane being used can be rotated electronically to permit an additional dimension to optimize views of the heart structures. Often, movement in all of these dimensions is needed. Modes The various modes describe how the ultrasound crystals are used to obtain information. These modes are common to all types of echocardiography. A-mode A-scan or one dimensional ultrasound represents over half the standard ECHO exam. For example, it is how aortic stenosis valve area. It is also how pressures are calculated in the heart such as right ventricle systolic pressure.

It is usually used in the form of Doppler measurements. There are two forms, pulse and continuous. Pulsed allows velocities to be calculated in a specific place, but has a limited velocity range is can be used. Continuous wave allows the velocity to be measured from zero to the fastest blood velocities a diseased heart can generate. However, it can not tell you where in the A-scan the high velocity is coming from. Continuous wave would be used to calculate aortic stenosis because you know the high velocity is coming from the stenosis region. Pulsed would be used to find a ventricular septal defect where there should be no velocity across the septum and the pulsed tells you the location. B-mode / 2D Brightness mode is often synonymous with "2D" and is very commonly used in echocardiography. M-mode Motion mode, though less commonly used, plays an important role in modern echocardiography.
