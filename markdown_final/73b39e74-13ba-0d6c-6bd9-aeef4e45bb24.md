## Question

Which oral antibiotics to give in pneumonia in place of injection durataz?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which oral antibiotics can be used in place of injection Durataz (ceftriaxone) for pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Durataz is and its role in pneumonia care. Then, I should verify the clinical context, including severity, setting, and patient factors. Next, I will review guideline-supported oral step-down options and their evidence base. After that, I need to check pharmacologic and PK/PD considerations for oral substitutes. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations by scenario and note caveats and exceptions where oral therapy may not be appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and its clinical role. Durataz is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin given parenterally for community-acquired pneumonia, often as initial IV therapy with subsequent step-down to oral agents once the patient stabilizes clinically [^3cc628db] [^760f62a6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral replacements without anchoring the clinical context. I need to check severity, setting, and patient factors because oral step-down is appropriate for clinically stable, non-ICU patients who can tolerate oral intake, whereas severe disease, ICU care, or unstable vitals generally require continued IV therapy and broader empiric coverage initially [^e2c9b1fb] [^8d887f20].

> Next, I should review guideline-endorsed oral options for stable CAP. For adults without severe disease, high-dose amoxicillin or doxycycline are first-line oral choices; in patients with comorbidities, an oral beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin like cefpodoxime or cefuroxime plus doxycycline is recommended, with macrolide monotherapy reserved for select settings due to pneumococcal resistance concerns [^d3e0a451] [^f7279f2f].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for oral therapy equivalence and step-down strategies. Randomized and observational data show that oral therapy can be as effective as parenteral therapy in appropriately selected hospitalized patients, and early switch from IV to oral therapy reduces length of stay and costs without increasing treatment failure when clinical stability criteria are met [^3add22c3] [^22586fb0] [^e2c9b1fb].

> I will now examine pharmacologic and PK/PD considerations for oral substitutes. Amoxicillin remains active against most pneumococci and H. influenzae, and doxycycline provides atypical coverage; cefpodoxime and cefuroxime are reasonable oral cephalosporins for step-down, though I should confirm local pneumococcal susceptibility patterns because oral cephalosporins may underperform when penicillin nonsusceptibility is high, and surrogacy testing suggests caution when oral penicillin MICs are elevated [^4e1e8799] [^5c63efe0].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has specific risk factors. For children 2–59 months with non-severe or severe CAP without danger signs, oral amoxicillin is effective and can replace parenteral therapy in many cases; for hospitalized children, step-down to oral amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is appropriate once stable, with total durations often 5–7 days depending on severity and response [^664a104d] [^2ddaf022] [^e289de9d].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions. In older adults with nursing home–acquired pneumonia or aspiration risk, I should confirm whether anaerobic coverage is needed; if so, amoxicillin/clavulanate or moxifloxacin may be preferred orally, whereas ceftriaxone alone lacks reliable anaerobic activity and may require addition of metronidazole or selection of an agent with broader anaerobic coverage when clinically indicated [^0ef7aedc].

> I should double-check duration and switch criteria. Contemporary adult CAP guidance supports a minimum of 5 total days, with therapy continued until clinical stability is achieved; in patients who stabilize quickly, stopping after 3 additional days of oral therapy following 3 days of IV therapy has been shown noninferior to longer courses, reinforcing early switch when criteria are met [^a3af71d4] [^37eb851a].

> Putting this together, my practical oral replacements for ceftriaxone in stable CAP are: high-dose amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours for uncomplicated cases; doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as an alternative; and for comorbidities or broader coverage, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily or an oral cephalosporin such as cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily or cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily, often paired with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily when atypicals are a concern; macrolide monotherapy is not preferred in many regions due to resistance, though azithromycin may be considered if local resistance is low and alternatives are contraindicated [^d3e0a451] [^f7279f2f].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overgeneralizing. Oral therapy is not appropriate for patients with severe disease, hemodynamic instability, impaired absorption, or who are not yet clinically stable; in those cases, continued IV therapy with ceftriaxone or an equivalent beta-lactam, with or without a macrolide or doxycycline depending on severity and risk, remains indicated until stabilization and step-down criteria are met [^e2c9b1fb] [^8d887f20].

For pneumonia, **oral amoxicillin** is the preferred alternative to injectable ceftriaxone (Durataz) when the patient is clinically stable, has no severe illness, and can tolerate oral intake [^d3e0a451]. If there is a penicillin allergy or local resistance concerns, **doxycycline or a macrolide (azithromycin)** are appropriate alternatives [^d3e0a451] [^f225f255]. For patients with comorbidities or more severe illness, **amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin)** are suitable oral options [^f7279f2f] [^f225f255]. The choice should be guided by local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, and clinical stability [^e2c9b1fb].

## Recommended oral alternatives to ceftriaxone

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | First-line for stable patients without severe illness | 1 g PO TID | Preferred for its efficacy, safety, and narrow spectrum [^d3e0a451] |
| Doxycycline | Alternative for penicillin allergy or intolerance | 100 mg PO BID | Effective against typical and atypical pathogens [^d3e0a451] |
| Azithromycin | Alternative for penicillin allergy or intolerance | 500 mg PO daily | Effective against atypical pathogens; use cautiously due to resistance [^d3e0a451] |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Patients with comorbidities or severe illness | 875/125 mg PO BID | Broad-spectrum coverage including beta-lactamase producers [^f7279f2f] |
| Levofloxacin | Patients with comorbidities or severe illness | 750 mg PO daily | Broad-spectrum coverage including atypical pathogens [^c3c7d0b4] |

## Clinical considerations when switching to oral therapy

- **Clinical stability**: Patients should be hemodynamically stable, improving clinically, able to ingest medications, and have a normally functioning gastrointestinal tract [^07b84128].
- **Severity of illness**: Oral therapy is appropriate for mild to moderate cases. Severe cases or those requiring ICU care should continue intravenous therapy [^notfound].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, allergies, and renal function should guide antibiotic selection and dosing [^f225f255].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Consider local epidemiology and resistance data when selecting antibiotics [^ec275d49].

---

## Evidence supporting oral therapy

Multiple studies and guidelines support the **effectiveness of oral antibiotics** for pneumonia, including:

- **Amoxicillin**: Effective for mild to moderate CAP, with clinical outcomes comparable to intravenous therapy in stable patients [^d3aee2eb].
- **Doxycycline**: Effective against typical and atypical pathogens, suitable for penicillin-allergic patients [^d3e0a451].
- **Macrolides**: Effective against atypical pathogens, though resistance concerns limit their use as monotherapy [^d3e0a451].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Effective for severe cases or patients with comorbidities, but should be used cautiously due to potential adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Oral amoxicillin is the **preferred alternative** to injectable ceftriaxone for pneumonia in clinically stable patients who can tolerate oral intake. Doxycycline, macrolides, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and fluoroquinolones are appropriate alternatives based on patient-specific factors, severity of illness, and local resistance patterns.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^ec275d49]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

### A phase 3, randomized, investigator-blinded trial comparing ceftobiprole with a standard-of-care cephalosporin, with or without vancomycin, for the treatment of pneumonia in pediatric patients [^e9d594af]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, most patients achieved clinical response at both day 4 and EOT, and the results were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Based on historical study data, achieving symptom improvement at day 4 is considered a relevant treatment response in CAP. As a result, it is endorsed by the US Food and Drug Administration as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials investigating new antibiotics for CAP. The importance of early treatment response has been further confirmed in a recent analysis of patient-level data from 6 CAP trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration after 2014. In this study of 4645 patients, concordance between early and late outcomes was found for 85.6% of patients. Moreover, early endpoint response had a positive predictive value of 92.9% for late endpoint success. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium also noted that an early endpoint of symptom improvement plus survival (up to day 7 of treatment) may be clinically relevant for patients with HAP. Clinical improvement at day 4 provides a useful indication of the comparative clinical efficacy of the 2 IV antibiotic approaches before the switch to physician-selected oral therapy has the potential to confound the comparison.

A high clinical cure rate was observed at the TOC and LFU visits in both treatment groups. A slightly higher cure rate was reported for the SoC cephalosporin group compared with the ceftobiprole group; however, these results must be interpreted with caution as the study was not powered to compare efficacy and the sample size in the comparator group was small. The results were also confounded by the inclusion of 4 patients in the ceftobiprole treatment group who received antibiotic therapy for infections other than pneumonia between the TOC and LFU visits; the clinical outcome in these patients was considered to be treatment failure, despite no relapse of pneumonia occurring. Evaluation of clinical cure at the TOC and LFU visits also reflects the combined efficacy of the IV study drugs and physician-selected oral antibiotics. Two previous studies of IV ceftriaxone in pediatric CAP, with an optional oral switch, have reported high clinical cure rates at the TOC visits (88.9% and 100%, respectively), which are similar to those reported here in both treatment groups. Consistent with the clinical cure endpoint, results of the Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to switch to oral therapy and time to hospital discharge were similar between the 2 treatment groups.

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, inclinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^41027f28]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ceftriaxone cutoffs (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) breakpoints showed acceptable results when used to predict cefpodoxime susceptibility in S. pneumoniae with acceptable categorical agreement (92.5%) and low error rates (0.0%–7.5%). Similar findings were reported by Murphy et al. when using the meningitis breakpoints for cefotaxime (≤ 0.5 mg/L for susceptible; 1 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 2 mg/L for resistant) as a surrogate marker for cefdinir susceptibility in a single-center study. The correlation of susceptibility categorization between oral and intravenous cephalosporins when applying lower breakpoints for the latter is likely explained by distinct pharmacokinetic properties. For example, the maximum free drug concentration of intravenous ceftriaxone is sixfold higher than oral cefpodoxime. Similarly, ceftriaxone has a half-life twofold longer than cefpodoxime. Since both ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime have the same pharmacodynamic target (> 40% time above MIC), ceftriaxone likely has a higher target attainment than cefpodoxime.

It is important to emphasize that the MIC comparison analysis presented here assumes that the breakpoints published by CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) remain appropriate and can accurately differentiate between susceptible and resistant isolates. However, breakpoints for older agents, including those evaluated here, were established mostly based on MIC distributions, pooled clinical data, and limited pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. In addition, randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of oral cephalosporins for treating CABP are limited, with some studies reporting favorable data related to early switch from parenteral to oral therapy published during the 1990s. These trials were performed when pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to oral penicillin was approximately 50% lower than current resistance rates (23.6% and 36.3%, respectively) and underscore the importance of considering more active agents for empiric therapy, such as omadacycline and lefamulin, which have a different mode of action (protein synthesis inhibitor) and potent in vitro activity against S. pneumoniae isolates (> 99% susceptible when applying FDA interpretive criteria).

This study confirms the use of the current susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) as a one-way only surrogacy AST to predict susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone against a contemporary collection of S. pneumoniae clinical isolates from multiple centers in the US, as indicated by the CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) document. However, isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin cannot be considered susceptible to cefpodoxime. In addition, parenteral penicillin breakpoints cannot predict cefpodoxime susceptibility but can be used as a complete surrogate marker to infer ceftriaxone susceptibility. Ceftriaxone should not be used as a surrogate for cefpodoxime due to an elevated number of very major errors (false-susceptible). However, ceftriaxone breakpoints lower than the current clinical cutoffs could be specifically applied for categorization of cefpodoxime susceptibility and warrant further evaluation in larger data sets. Similar surrogacy analysis should be conducted for other commonly used oral cephalosporins (e.g. cefdinir and cefuroxime) in the US for treating CABP to provide further guidance to clinical microbiology laboratories.

### A prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter comparison of parenteral ertapenem and ceftriaxone for the treatment of hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia [^4c1739b8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ertapenem is a once-daily parenteral beta-lactam licensed in the United States in November 2001 and in Europe in May 2002.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety profiles of ertapenem with those of ceftriaxone for the treatment of hospitalized adult patients with serious community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring parenteral therapy.

Methods

In this prospective, double-blind (with sponsor blinding), multicenter study, adult patients with CAP were stratified by Pneumonia Severity Index (≤ 3 or > 3) and age (≤ 65 or > 65 years) and randomized (2:1) to receive IV or intramuscular (IM) ertapenem 1 g once daily or IV or IM ceftriaxone 1 g once daily. Investigators could switch patients to an oral antimicrobial agent if clinical improvement was shown after at least 3 days of parenteral therapy.

Results

A total of 364 patients were randomized to treatment: 239 to the ertapenem group and 125 to the ceftriaxone group. Three patients in the ertapenem group and 2 in the ceftriaxone group did not receive study therapy. Of the treated patients, 77.1% (182/236) of patients in the ertapenem group and 75.6% (93/123) in the ceftriaxone group were clinically evaluable. Among clinically evaluable patients, the mean (SD) durations of parenteral and total (parenteral plus optional oral) therapy were 5.5 (2.6) and 11.5 (2.7) days for ertapenem and 5.6 (2.8) and 11.7 (3.0) days for ceftriaxone, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen in both treatment groups. Cure rates were 92.2% for clinically evaluable patients in the ertapenem group and 93.6% for those in the ceftriaxone group (95% CI for the difference, adjusted for stratum, -8.6 to 5.7), fulfilling the criteria for statistical equivalence. At completion of parenteral therapy, 94.7% of patients in the ertapenem group and 95.8% in the ceftriaxone group showed clinical improvement. Infused vein complications (ertapenem, 3.4% [8/236]; ceftriaxone, 7.3% [9/123]) and elevated transaminase levels (ertapenem, 6.3% [13/207]; ceftriaxone, 7.1% [8/113]) were the most common adverse events in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of hospitalized adult patients, ertapenem therapy, with an oral switch option, was as effective as ceftriaxone with the same oral switch option for treatment of CAP requiring initial parenteral therapy. The overall safety profiles of the 2 drugs were comparable.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^0f207634]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia treatment — first-choice options for S. pneumoniae (occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) include amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management, ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL), or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternative parenteral options are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate; for children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day), and add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae).

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^37eb851a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, inclinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^4e1e8799]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100Ed24 (2024) states that Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptible to oral penicillin can be considered susceptible to various β-lactams, including oral cephalosporins. However, surrogacy guidance is not available for isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin. Instead, such isolates require specific MIC testing and interpretations for reporting susceptibility to oral cephalosporins, for which susceptibility testing is limited in most automated systems, and consequently restricts information pertaining to oral cephalosporins at an individual institution. This study evaluated the ability of the penicillin breakpoints to predict cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone susceptibilities against a recent collection of S. pneumoniae from United States hospitals according to CLSI guidelines. The susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) predicted susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone. However, when isolates were nonsusceptible to oral penicillin (MIC, > 0.06 mg/L), susceptibility to cefpodoxime could not be predicted due to a low categorical agreement (CA) (78.4%). Parenteral penicillin breakpoints also could not predict cefpodoxime susceptibility due to the elevated number of very major errors and a CA of 76.8%; however, these breakpoints could still be used as a surrogate marker to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility. Finally, ceftriaxone could be used for surrogate testing of cefpodoxime by applying breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current clinical cutoffs. These analyses showed that isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin cannot be considered susceptible to cefpodoxime, and caution should be used when prescribing oral cephalosporins for the empiric treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

IMPORTANCE

Susceptibility results to oral cephalosporins are rarely available to guide therapy due to the limited number of drugs evaluated on common automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems (i.e. Vitek 2, MicroScan, and Phoenix). In addition, disk diffusion methods for determining Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to β-lactam agents are not reliable, and a quantitative method, such as broth microdilution or gradient strips, is required. In addition, the epidemiology and serotypes of S. pneumoniae are constantly evolving; therefore, this work provides a re-evaluation of surrogacy testing for β-lactam agents against S. pneumoniae recently recovered from United States laboratories. The data provide the possible use of ceftriaxone MIC for determining cefpodoxime susceptibility. This should be of interest to microbiology laboratories and the scientific community.

### Ceftriaxone (Easy-ceft) [^ee9286f1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophi/us influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (complicated and uncomplicated) caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (cervical/urethral and rectal) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (inpatient setting, nonsevere CAP), ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider administering combination therapy with a β-lactam (ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone) and doxycycline 100 mg BID as an alternative option in adult patients with CAP with contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones.

Instead, such isolates require specific MIC testing and interpretations for reporting susceptibility to oral cephalosporins, for which susceptibility testing is limited in most automated systems, and consequently restricts information pertaining to oral cephalosporins at an individual institution. This study evaluated the ability of the penicillin breakpoints to predict cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone susceptibilities against a recent collection of S. pneumoniae from United States hospitals according to CLSI guidelines. The susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) predicted susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone. However, when isolates were nonsusceptible to oral penicillin (MIC, > 0.06 mg/L), susceptibility to cefpodoxime could not be predicted due to a low categorical agreement (CA) (78.4%). Parenteral penicillin breakpoints also could not predict cefpodoxime susceptibility due to the elevated number of very major errors and a CA of 76.8%; however, these breakpoints could still be used as a surrogate marker to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility. Finally, ceftriaxone could be used for surrogate testing of cefpodoxime by applying breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current clinical cutoffs. These analyses showed that isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin cannot be considered susceptible to cefpodoxime, and caution should be used when prescribing oral cephalosporins for the empiric treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. IMPORTANCESusceptibility results to oral cephalosporins are rarely available to guide therapy due to the limited number of drugs evaluated on common automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems (i.e. Vitek 2, MicroScan, and Phoenix). In addition, disk diffusion methods for determining Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to β-lactam agents are not reliable, and a quantitative method, such as broth microdilution or gradient strips, is required. In addition, the epidemiology and serotypes of S. pneumoniae are constantly evolving; therefore, this work provides a re-evaluation of surrogacy testing for β-lactam agents against S. pneumoniae recently recovered from United States laboratories. The data provide the possible use of ceftriaxone MIC for determining cefpodoxime susceptibility. This should be of interest to microbiology laboratories and the scientific community.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^83a95687]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

INTRODUCTION

According to the World Health Organization, lower respiratory infections were the sixth most common cause of death in high-income countries in 2019 and among the top 5 causes of death in low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income groups. More specifically, pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among adult patients in the United States, and Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Although there is a trend toward the reduction of mortality due to pneumonia over time, the attributable mortality of pneumococcal CABP has not changed in the last two decades, in conjunction with an increase in the rate of hospitalization and more severe forms of CABP.

CABP is often treated empirically, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends β-lactam, macrolide, doxycycline, or respiratory quinolone monotherapy for outpatients with non-severe infection, whereas combination therapy is recommended for patients with comorbidities. In addition, when intravenous therapies are utilized, various treatment guidelines and stewardship programs now recommend switching to oral antibiotics when patients demonstrate clinical improvement, have adequate oral intake and gastrointestinal absorption, and are hemodynamically stable. In the United States, the most common oral β-lactams used in this setting are amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, cefuroxime, and cefpodoxime. However, even when S. pneumoniae is recovered from clinical specimens and available for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), susceptibility results to recommended oral cephalosporins are rarely available to guide therapy due to the limited number of drugs evaluated on common automated AST systems (i.e. Vitek 2, MicroScan, and Phoenix). In addition, disk diffusion methods for determining S. pneumoniae susceptibility to β-lactam agents are not reliable, and quantitative (MIC) methods, such as gradient strip diffusion or broth microdilution, are required.

### Oral amoxicillin versus benzyl penicillin for severe pneumonia among Kenyan children: a pragmatic randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^d8aee2eb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Oral treatment of severe pneumonia offers several potential benefits including the alternative of outpatient treatment, reduced demand for nursing care, elimination of the risks associated with injectable medications, and a potential reduction in the overall cost of treatment. The findings of this study are consistent with those of previous trials suggesting similar outcomes for severe pneumonia treated with benzyl penicillin and oral amoxicillin. The pragmatic nature of the study and associated data on the frequency and nature of treatment failure will provide important new evidence to support discussions on appropriate guidance for Kenya and, potentially, other countries with similar patient populations and health systems.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^ffc3b0ab]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

(a) Antibiotic treatment of severe pneumonia: benzyl penicillin/ampicillin versus amoxicillin

Three trials compared oral versus parenteral treatment for severe pneumonia: Addo-Yobo et al conducted a large multi-centre trial of 1702 children in Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa (two sites), Vietnam, and Zambia while Atkinson et al recruited 203 children with radiologically-confirmed community acquired pneumonia in the UK and Hazir et al studied 2100 Pakistani children. All three trials, supported by a meta-analysis of the results of the studies by Hazir et al and Addo-Yobo et al which showed a pooled risk ratio of treatment failure for the two studies of 0.97, 95% CI 0.83–1.14, suggested equivalence of the two treatments. Since the studies were conducted among predominantly non-African populations the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level for indirectness. The evidence was therefore graded as moderate quality suggesting equivalence comparing benzyl penicillin and amoxicillin (Table 5).

(b) Antibiotic treatment of severe pneumonia: benzyl penicillin/ampicillin monotherapy versus benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin

Only one small trial was found comparing costs and clinical outcomes enrolling 40 children with severe pneumonia in Malaysia in 1999/2000 after randomization to either benzyl penicillin/ampicillin monotherapy or combination therapy with gentamicin. The results of this trial showed no differences in clinical outcome between the two treatments and higher costs associated with the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin.

Very severe pneumonia

Two policy questions were addressed relating to antibiotic treatment of children with very severe pneumonia:

1) Should chloramphenicol be abandoned as an alternative treatment to benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin?

2) Should benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin/chloramphenicol be replaced by ceftriaxone?

Two trials reviewed addressed each of the two questions. The studies were also summarized in a Cochrane review.

### A phase 3, randomized, investigator-blinded trial comparing ceftobiprole with a standard-of-care cephalosporin, with or without vancomycin, for the treatment of pneumonia in pediatric patients [^0000a5a1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The advanced-generation, broad-spectrum, intravenous (IV) cephalosporin, ceftobiprole, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for adults with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but its effects in pediatric patients have not been established.

Methods

In this multicenter, investigator-blinded, active-controlled, phase 3 study, patients 3 months to < 18 years old with HAP or CAP requiring hospitalization were randomized (2:1) to ceftobiprole versus standard-of-care (SoC) IV cephalosporin treatments (ceftazidime or ceftriaxone), with or without vancomycin. After at least 3 days' IV treatment, patients demonstrating clinical improvement could be switched to an oral antibiotic, to complete a minimum of 7 days' treatment.

Results

Overall, 138 patients were randomized to ceftobiprole (n = 94) or a SoC cephalosporin (n = 44). Median time to oral switch was 6.0 days in the ceftobiprole group and 8.0 days in the SoC cephalosporin group. While on IV therapy, adverse events and treatment-related adverse events were reported by 20.2% and 8.5% of ceftobiprole-treated patients and 18.2% and 0% of SoC cephalosporin-treated patients. Early clinical response rates at day 4 in the intention-to-treat population were 95.7% and 93.2% (between-group difference, 2.6%; 95% confidence interval, -5.5% to 14.7%) in the ceftobiprole and comparator groups, and clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 90.4% and 97.7% (between-group difference, -7.3%; 95% confidence interval, -15.7% to 3.6%), respectively.

Conclusions

Ceftobiprole was well tolerated and, in this small phase 3 study, demonstrated similar efficacy to SoC cephalosporins in pediatric patients with HAP or CAP requiring hospitalization.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children [^6485ea92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens is the leading cause of mortality in children in low-income countries. Early administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009); and EMBASE (1990 to September 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, comparing at least two antibiotics for CAP within hospital or ambulatory (outpatient) settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from full articles of selected studies.

Main Results

There were 27 studies, which enroled 11,928 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotic with placebo. For ambulatory treatment of non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.47) and cure rates (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.03). (Three studies involved 3952 children). In children hospitalised with severe CAP, oral amoxycillin compared with injectable penicillin or ampicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15). (Three studies involved 3942 children). Relapse rates were similar in the two groups (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). (One study involved 1116 children).

Authors' Conclusions

There were many studies with different methodologies investigating multiple antibiotics. For treatment of ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. For severe pneumonia without hypoxia, oral amoxycillin may be an alternative to injectable penicillin in hospitalised children; however, for ambulatory treatment of such patients with oral antibiotics, more studies in community settings are required. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are ceftrioxone, levofloxacin, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as a second-line therapy. There is a need for more studies with larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics.

### Integrated analysis of FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2: randomized, doubled-blinded, multicenter phase 3 trials of the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^2a5e5a44]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ceftaroline, the active form of ceftaroline fosamil, is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was evaluated for the treatment of CAP in 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials: Ceftaroline Community Acquired Pneumonia Trial versus Ceftriaxone in Hospitalized Patients (FOCUS) 1 and FOCUS 2.

Methods

Patients hospitalized (but not admitted to an intensive care unit) with Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team risk class III or IV CAP requiring intravenous therapy were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 h or ceftriaxone 1 g every 24 h for 5–7 days. Patients in FOCUS 1 received 2 doses of oral clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 h on day 1.

Results

In the individual trials, clinical cure rates in the clinically evaluable (CE) population for ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone were as follows: FOCUS 1, 86.6% vs 78.2% (difference, 8.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4%-15.4%); FOCUS 2, 82.1% vs 77.2% (difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -2.5% to 12.5%). In the integrated analysis, 614 patients received ceftaroline and 614 received ceftriaxone. Of the CE patients treated with ceftaroline, 84.3% achieved clinical cure, compared with 77.7% of ceftriaxone-treated patients (difference, 6.7%; 95% CI, 1.6%-11.8%). Clinical cure rates in the modified intent-to-treat efficacy population were 82.6% versus 76.6% for ceftaroline and ceftriaxone (difference, 6.0%; 95% CI, 1.4%-10.7%). Ceftaroline and ceftriaxone were well tolerated; rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and premature discontinuations caused by an adverse event were similar in both treatment arms.

Conclusions

Ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone in the individual trials. In this integrated analysis, clinical cure rates for the ceftaroline group were numerically higher than those for the ceftriaxone group. Ceftaroline was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of ceftriaxone.

### Antibiotic use in children hospitalised with pneumonia in central Vietnam [^ce679154]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Excessive use of antibiotics has been noted in children with respiratory tract infections in Vietnam, but antibiotic use in hospitalised children is poorly documented. Antibiotic use and direct healthcare costs in children hospitalised with pneumonia in central Vietnam were assessed.

Methods

A prospective descriptive study of children under 5 years old admitted with a primary admission diagnosis of 'pneumonia' to the Da Nang Hospital for Women and Children over 1year.

Results

Of 2911 children hospitalised with pneumonia, 2735 (94.0%) were classified as 'non-severe' pneumonia by the admitting physician. In total, 2853 (98.0%) children received antibiotics. Intravenous antibiotics were given to 336 (12.3%) children with 'non-severe' and 157/176 (89.2%) children with 'severe' pneumonia; those with 'non-severe' pneumonia accounted for 68.2% (336/493) of intravenous antibiotics given. Only 19.3% (95/493) of children on intravenous antibiotics were stepped down to an oral antibiotic. Cefuroxime was the preferred oral agent, and ceftriaxone was the preferred injectable agent. Hospital admission for oral antibiotics in 'non-severe' pneumonia was a major cost driver, with an average direct cost of US$78.9 per patient, accounting for 54.0% of the total hospitalisation cost in the study cohort. In addition, 336 (12.3%) children with non-severe pneumonia received intravenous antibiotics without indication, accounting for a further 23.2% of hospitalisation costs.

Conclusion

Limiting unnecessary hospitalisation and considering early intravenous to oral step down antibiotic will reduce direct health system costs and morbidity in children with respiratory tract infections in Vietnam.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, outpatient setting, patients with comorbidities, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer combination therapy of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and doxycycline 100 mg PO BID as another option.

### Evidence for the use of intramuscular injections in outpatient practice [^b02d731c]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

There are few studies comparing the outcomes of patients who are treated with oral versus intramuscular antibiotics, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or vitamin B12. This may lead to confusion about when the intramuscular route is indicated. For example, intramuscular ceftriaxone for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and intramuscular penicillin G benzathine for Treponema pallidum infection are the treatments of choice. However, oral antibiotics are the treatment of choice for the outpatient treatment of pneumonia and most other outpatient bacterial infections. Oral corticosteroids are as effective as intramuscular corticosteroids and are well-tolerated by most patients. High daily doses of oral vitamin B12 with ongoing clinical surveillance appear to be as effective as intramuscular treatment. Few data support choosing intramuscular ketorolac over an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug unless the patient is unable to tolerate an oral medication. For other indications, the intramuscular route should be considered only when the delivery of a medication must be confirmed, such as when a patient cannot tolerate an oral medication, or when compliance is uncertain.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^338d7596]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Moving from evidence to recommendations

The GRADE approach indicates that contextual factors including cost, local values and preferences, feasibility, undesired effects and benefits should be taken into account in making a recommendation based on evidence. There is no explicitly defined preferred method for taking these factors into account. Our pragmatic approach was to engage a national guideline development forum attended by a panel of 70 people from academic and policy backgrounds and routine clinical settings. After presenting and discussing the evidence we invited discussion on these contextual considerations (Figure 2) amongst panelists to inform development of recommendations rather than relying on research data alone. However, this forum did not include patient representatives as is recommended in GRADE, instead professional health workers were asked to consider this perspective. Such an approach is pragmatic but has clear limitations. However, gaining patients' perspectives, particularly when they are children, is a poorly developed area of practice and research in both low and high income settings alike. How this forum and deliberative process proceeded will be described in detail elsewhere, however here we illustrate how the evidence met with contrasting fates in the process of making recommendations.

Most notable was a strong recommendation against the proposal to adopt oral amoxicillin in place of or even as an alternative to benzyl penicillin/ampicillin for severe pneumonia. This was despite evidence from three large trials suggesting equivalence between the treatments and several additional factors apparently favoring oral amoxicillin including lower cost, more convenient twice daily dosing and reduction in the use of injections in children. In this case the panel essentially discounted moderate quality evidence and felt that such a change in policy should only be informed by locally-generated data. Such an absolute rejection of evidence gathered from trials involving almost 5000 children, something of a surprise to those summarizing it, was also observed for other guideline topics. In this particular case one could speculate that the absence of patient views, children who might receive either multiple injections or oral therapy, might have been an important omission.

### Top POEMs of 2024… [^fc261b8a]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Continue treating community-acquired pneumonia the way you're doing it. It's difficult, given the existing research data, to determine big differences in the clinical impact of the various oral antibiotics used for initial treatment. Using clarithromycin as the standard, telithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and the quinolones levofloxacin and nemonoxacin produce similar benefits with regard to clinical response and mortality. Amoxicillin and penicillin may not work as well. Doxycycline, recommended in some guidelines, was not included in this analysis. Reference Kurotschka PK, Bentivegna M, Hulme C, Ebell MH.

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, inclinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^22620507]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The current high number of S. pneumoniae nonsusceptible to oral penicillin minimizes the use of penicillin as surrogate testing, and these nonsusceptible isolates require specific AST for determining the susceptibility for oral and parenteral cephalosporins. This scenario challenges routine clinical microbiology laboratories due to the absence of oral cephalosporins in automated systems. Despite these AST challenges, clinical guidelines recommend amoxicillin or doxycycline as options for empiric treatment of CABP in outpatients without comorbidities, and amoxicillin-clavulanate or select oral cephalosporins in combination with a macrolide and doxycycline in patients with comorbidities. The rationale for these latest IDSA recommendations is that these combinations should effectively target macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, as β-lactam resistance is less common. However, while in vitro resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxone is less common, 23.3% of isolates included in this study were nonsusceptible to cefpodoxime according to current CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) breakpoints. Moreover, a previous study reported cefpodoxime nonsusceptibilities of 46.7% and 38.1% when isolates were also nonsusceptible to macrolides or doxycycline, respectively. These data indicate the need for re-evaluation of oral cephalosporins for the empiric treatment of CABP in addition to potential guideline updates for surrogacy AST.

### Oral antibiotics in the management of serious neonatal bacterial infections in developing country communities [^ed017853]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Parenteral antibiotic therapy is the standard of care for treatment of serious neonatal infections. This may not be possible, however, in some developing country settings with limited health systems capacity.

Methods

We reviewed the evidence for treatment of neonatal infections in developing countries with oral antibiotics, evaluated properties of oral agents that could be considered, and identified priority research questions.

Results

Case management of pneumonia in developing country community settings suggests that this strategy has resulted in substantial reductions in neonatal mortality. However, limited available data indicate that injectable antibiotic therapy is superior to oral regimens.

Conclusions

Parenteral therapy should be used for treatment of serious neonatal infections whenever possible. In settings in which this is not possible, however, oral antibiotic therapy is superior to no antibiotic therapy. Further research is needed to define subgroups of patients and settings in which therapy with oral agents is ethical and effective.

### Once-daily cefepime versus ceftriaxone for nursing home-acquired pneumonia [^e3ebcb92]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare once-daily intramuscular cefepime with ceftriaxone controls.

Design

Double-blind study.

Setting

Six skilled nursing facilities.

Participants

Residents aged 60 and older with nursing home-acquired pneumonia.

Intervention

Cultures were obtained, and patients were randomized to cefepime or ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly every 24 hours.

Measurements

Clinical success: cure or improvement. Cure was defined as complete resolution of all symptoms and signs of pneumonia or a return to the patient's baseline state. Improvement was defined as clear improvement but incomplete resolution of all pretherapy symptoms or signs or incomplete return to the patient's usual baseline status. Safety and pharmacoeconomics were also assessed.

Results

Sixty-nine patients were randomized; 61 were evaluable: (32 to cefepime, 29 ceftriaxone). Patients were predominately female (76%). They had a mean age ± standard deviation of 85 ± 6, with a mean 5.8 ± 1.9 comorbidities; they had age-appropriate renal dysfunction, with a mean estimated creatinine clearance of 35 ± 7 mL/min. Clinical success occurred in 78% of cefepime- and 66% of ceftriaxone-treated patients (P = 0.39). Fifty-seven patients (93%) were switched to oral antibiotics after 3 days. Antibiotic-related adverse events occurred in 5% of patients. Seven patients (11.5%) were hospitalized. The overall mortality rate was 8%. Mean antibiotic costs were 117 ± 40 dollars for cefepime- and 215 ± 68 dollars for ceftriaxone-treated patients (P < .001). Cost-effectiveness analysis of total costs showed that cefepime would cost 597 dollars and ceftriaxone 1,709 dollars per expected successfully treated patient. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses using a generic price for ceftriaxone and improving its comparative efficacy revealed that the results were robust.

Conclusions

Once-daily cefepime was a cost-effective alternative to ceftriaxone for the treatment of elderly nursing home residents who developed pneumonia and did not require hospitalization.

### Short-course versus long-course intravenous therapy with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months [^05f8e599]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood mortality from infectious disease, responsible for an estimated 1.3 million deaths annually in children under five years of age, many of which are in low-income countries. The World Health Organization recommends intravenous antibiotics for five days as first-line treatment for children with severe pneumonia. Although controversy exists regarding the specific clinical features used to diagnose pneumonia, the criteria for diagnosis of severe pneumonia are better defined and are widely used to triage children for referral and second-line therapy. In 2011 it was estimated that approximately 120 million new cases of pneumonia occur globally each year in children under five years of age, of which 14 million become severe episodes. Hospitalisation for severe pneumonia in children places a significant burden on both patients and their families, including substantial expense, loss of routine, and decrease in quality of life. By reducing the duration of hospital treatment, healthcare burdens could potentially be reduced and treatment compliance may improve. This is an update of a review published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous therapy (alone or in combination with oral antibiotics) with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to December week 3, 2016), Embase (1974 to 22 December 2016), and four trials registers (23 August 2017), together with reference checking of all relevant trials and reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous antibiotic therapy (alone or in combination with oral antibiotics) for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months. We excluded children with any other debilitating disease, including those infected with HIV. We also excluded children who had developed pneumonia during their hospital stay (i.e. with nosocomial infection). There was no restriction on the type of antibiotic used, the dose, or the frequency of dosing.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Our searches identified 4295 records, however no studies met our predefined inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified no randomised controlled trials comparing a short course (two to three days) of intravenous antibiotics compared to a long course (five days) for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months that met our inclusion criteria.

### The management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^6d8bcae3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, inpatient regimens, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer empiric therapy with a third-generation parenteral cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) in not fully immunized hospitalized infants and pediatric patients in regions where local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal strains documents high-level penicillin resistance, or in infants and pediatric patients with a life-threatening infection, including empyema.

### Safety and efficacy of simplified antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of serious infection in neonates and young infants 0–59 days of age in Bangladesh: design of a randomized controlled trial [^9fdc92be]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that oral antibiotic therapy also reduces mortality in neonates and young infants with suspected infections. A meta-analysis of trials of community-based case management of pneumonia found a 27% reduction in neonatal mortality and a 20% reduction in infant mortality. Five of the 7 studies included in the meta-analysis used oral antibiotic regimens. In an open-label trial in Pakistan, 3- to 59-month-old children (n = 2037) with severe pneumonia were randomly allocated to either (1) hospitalization and parenteral ampicillin (100 mg/kg per day in 4 doses) for 48 hours, followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day in 2 doses), or (2) home-based treatment for 5 days with oral amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day in 2 doses). At 7 days after the start of treatment, no difference in treatment failure rates was observed between the hospitalized group (8.6%) and the ambulatory group (7.5%; risk difference 1.1%; 95% CI: –1.3 to 3.5). High failure rates, however, were associated with age 3–5 months, very fast breathing (> 70 breaths per minute for children < 12 months old) and low weight for age, suggesting that providing oral antibiotics alone may be inadequate for young infants with clinical severe infection. Alternatives for these infants include restricting the number of injectable antibiotics either by combining a initial short course of parenteral antibiotics with a switch to oral antibiotics or a combination of injectable and oral antibiotics.

In 2007, a global consultation convened by the Saving Newborn Lives Initiative of Save the Children, the United States Agency for International Development and the WHO concluded that there was insufficient evidence on infection management in young infants in community-based settings to make policy recommendations for global programs. The consultation highlighted the need for research to test combinations of low cost existing oral and intramuscular antibiotic regimens that might feasibly be implemented in first-level facilities and the community, and that would be acceptable in settings characterized by weak health systems.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^c6db831b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The present study had several limitations. First, there was uncertainty about the effect size. The difference between groups could potentially be smaller or non-existent. Second, this was a single-center trial. Because the background characteristics of patients would differ between hospitals, the severity of pneumonia would be different. Therefore, whether the clinical differences observed between the two antibiotics in the present study can be generalized needs to be investigated in a follow-up study. Third, to judge whether the patient had aspiration pneumonia, risk factors for aspiration were evaluated, but not swallowing function or silent aspiration at night. Some cases of pneumonia in the present study might thus have been caused by silent aspiration of oral bacteria. Distinguishing pneumonia caused by oral anaerobic bacteria from that caused by other bacteria by evaluating only the risk factors for aspiration was difficult. However, because it is not routine in clinical practice to evaluate swallowing function to judge whether a patient has aspiration pneumonia, the results of the present study can be considered at least somewhat reflective of actual clinical practice.

### Cefuroxime sodium [^f3fd5ea1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult dosage range for Cefuroxime for Injection is 750 mg to 1.5 grams every 8 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days. In uncomplicated urinary tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, disseminated gonococcal infections, and uncomplicated pneumonia, a 750-mg dose every 8 hours is recommended. In severe or complicated infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended.

In bone and joint infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In clinical trials, surgical intervention was performed when indicated as an adjunct to therapy with Cefuroxime for Injection. A course of oral antibiotics was administered when appropriate following the completion of parenteral administration of Cefuroxime for Injection.

In life-threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required. In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours. The recommended dosage for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is 1.5 grams given intramuscularly as a single dose at 2 different sites together with 1 gram of oral probenecid. For preventive use for clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated surgical procedures, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously just before surgery (approximately one-half to 1 hour before the initial incision) is recommended. Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged.

For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 6 grams is recommended.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, general principles, BTS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer amoxicillin as the first-line oral antibiotic in all pediatric patients due to its effectiveness against the majority of pathogens causing CAP in this group, good tolerance profile, and cost. Administer amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin as an alternative.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^64aa66c9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

14.2 Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP)

Adult Patients

A total of 1231 adults with a diagnosis of CABP were enrolled in two randomized, multi-center, multinational, double-blind, non-inferiority trials (Trials 1 and 2) comparing Teflaro (600 mg administered IV over 1 hour every 12 hours) with ceftriaxone (1 g ceftriaxone administered IV over 30 minutes every 24 hours). In both treatment groups of CABP Trial 1, two doses of oral clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours), were administered as adjunctive therapy starting on Study Day 1. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was used in CABP Trial 2. Patients with known or suspected MRSA were excluded from both trials. Patients with new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate(s) on chest radiography and signs and symptoms consistent with CABP with the need for hospitalization and IV therapy were enrolled in the trials. Treatment duration was 5 to 7 days. A switch to oral therapy was not allowed. Among all subjects who received any amount of study drug in the two CABP trials, the 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 11/609 (1.8%) for the Teflaro group vs. 12/610 (2.0%) for the ceftriaxone group, and the difference in mortality rates was not statistically significant.

### A study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ertapenem versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^8d5bf0e5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In a double-blind, multicenter trial, 502 patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia were randomized to receive therapy with either ertapenem or ceftriaxone (for each, 1 g given intravenously once daily). After a minimum of 3 days, therapy could be switched to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. The median duration of intravenously administered therapy for the 383 clinically evaluable patients was 4 days for both treatment groups; 345 patients (90.1%) had their treatment switched to orally administered therapy. Of the clinically evaluable patients, 168 (92.3%) in the ertapenem group and 183 (91.0%) in the ceftriaxone group had a favorable clinical response. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated pathogen, and high cure rates were observed both for penicillin-susceptible and -nonsusceptible infections in the ertapenem group (28 [87.5%] of 32 patients versus 17 [100%] of 17 patients, respectively). Both treatment regimens were generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse events reported were diarrhea (2.9% versus 2.7%) and nausea (0.8% versus 2.0%) in the ertapenem and ceftriaxone groups, respectively. These results suggest that ertapenem and ceftriaxone therapy have similar efficacy and safety in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^e896b3ed]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in children [^f0a10514]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children. In developing countries, pneumonia is usually caused by bacterial pathogens. The early administration of empirical antibiotics improves the patients' clinical outcomes. There are currently no systematic reviews of clinical trials on this subject.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotic drug therapy for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (OVID) (1966 to January 2006) and EMBASE (WebSPIRS) (1990 to September 2005). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, which compared at least two antibiotics for CAP in hospital or ambulatory settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from full articles of selected studies were independently extracted by two authors.

Main Results

The review of these studies suggests that for treatment of pneumonia, co-trimoxazole is inferior in efficacy to both amoxycillin (failure rates odds ratio (OR) 1.33; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67) and procaine penicillin (cure rates OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.57 to 4.45). Penicillin in conjunction with gentamycin was better than chloramphenicol alone (re-hospitalization rates OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.55). Co-amoxyclavulanic acid was better than amoxycillin alone (cure rates OR 10.44; 95% CI 2.85 to 38.21). There was no differences between injectable penicillin and oral amoxycillin (failure rates OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.31); azithromycin and erythromycin (cure rates OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.95); cefpodoxime and amoxycillin (cure rates OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.18 to 2.60); or azithromycin and co-amoxyclavulanic acid (cure rates OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.95, failure rates OR 1.42; 95% CI 0.43 to 4.66).

Authors' Conclusions

There were many studies each investigating multiple antibiotics with different methodologies. For treatment of ambulatory patients with CAP, amoxycillin was better than co-trimoxazole; there was no difference between azithromycin and erythromycin, or between cefpodoxime and co-amoxyclavulanic acid. For hospitalized patients, procaine penicillin was better than co-trimoxazole; and the combination of penicillin and gentamycin was better than chloramphenicol alone. Injectable penicillin and oral amoxycillin had similar failure rates. For the rest of the antibiotics there were only single studies available. There is a need for more studies with large patient populations and similar methodologies in order to compare newer antibiotics.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^0ef7aedc]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A physician's intention to treat aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic therapy was based on initiation of a first-line antibiotic parenterally within 2 days of admission according to the 2019 ATS and IDSA guidelines. The first-line antibiotic for CAP could be ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate (equivalent to ampicillin-sulbactam, which was not available in Canada), levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.

Patients were excluded if they fulfilled any of following criteria:
1 The patient died before receiving antibiotic treatment because they would not have been included in the analogous trial.
2 The patient had a diagnosis of lung abscess or empyema based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes J85.x and J86.x, which would require extended anaerobic coverage.
3 The patient received only oral antibiotics, because this would introduce confounding by indication. Patients given only oral antibiotics would be more likely to receive extended anaerobic coverage, because all first-line CAP antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage (amoxicillin-clavulanate and moxifloxacin) can be given orally, whereas some antibiotics with limited anaerobic coverage (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) can be given only parenterally. Oral route of administration also was associated with outcome because less severely ill patients would be more likely to be treated with oral antibiotics initially. In clinical practice, patients with aspiration pneumonia usually are initiated on parenteral antibiotics because they typically have swallowing difficulties or are kept nil per os during the acute event.

This study included only community-acquired aspiration pneumonia based on diagnosis and treatment within the first 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was not included in this study because it is a different clinical entity in terms of microbiology, empiric antibiotic therapy, and prognosis.

### Clinical and bacteriological outcomes in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated with azithromycin plus ceftriaxone, or ceftriaxone plus clarithromycin or erythromycin: a prospective, randomised, multicentre study [^dcb7da99]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

This study compared patients with moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalisation, who received initial therapy with either intravenous ceftriaxone plus intravenous azithromycin, followed by step-down to oral azithromycin (n = 135), with patients who received intravenous ceftriaxone combined with either intravenous clarithromycin or erythromycin, followed by step-down to either oral clarithromycin or erythromycin (n = 143). Clinical and bacteriological outcomes were evaluated at the end of therapy (EOT; day 12–16) or at the end of study (EOS; day 28–35). At baseline, mean APACHE II scores were 13.3 and 12.6, respectively, with > 50% of patients classified as Fine Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) category IV or V. Clinical success rates (cure or improvement) in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population at EOT were 84.3% in the ceftriaxone/azithromycin group and 82.7% in the ceftriaxone/clarithromycin or erythromycin group. At EOS, MITT success rates (cure only) were 81.7% and 75.0%, respectively. Equivalent success rates in the clinically evaluable population were 83% and 87%, respectively, at EOT, and 79% and 78%, respectively, at EOS. MITT bacteriological eradication rates were 73.2% and 67.4%, respectively, at EOT, and 68.3% vs. 60.9%, respectively, at EOS. Mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was 10.7 and 12.6 days, and the mean duration of therapy was 9.5 and 10.5 days, respectively. The incidence of infusion-related adverse events was 16.3% and 25.2% (p 0.04), respectively. An intravenous-to-oral regimen of ceftriaxone/azithromycin was at least equivalent in efficacy and safety to the comparator regimen and appeared to be a suitable treatment option for hospitalised patients with CAP.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^055385d6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children [^2ddaf022]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens is the leading cause of mortality in children in low-income countries. Early administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotic drug therapies for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of varying severity in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 10; MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012); EMBASE (1990 to November 2012); CINAHL (2009 to November 2012); Web of Science (2009 to November 2012) and LILACS (2009 to November 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, comparing at least two antibiotics for CAP within hospital or ambulatory (outpatient) settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the full articles of selected studies.

Main Results

We included 29 trials, which enrolled 14,188 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotics with placebo. Assessment of quality of study revealed that 5 out of 29 studies were double-blind and allocation concealment was adequate. Another 12 studies were unblinded but had adequate allocation concealment, classifying them as good quality studies. There was more than one study comparing co-trimoxazole with amoxycillin, oral amoxycillin with injectable penicillin/ampicillin and chloramphenicol with ampicillin/penicillin and studies were of good quality, suggesting the evidence for these comparisons was of high quality compared to other comparisons. In ambulatory settings, for treatment of World Health Organization (WHO) defined non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.51) and cure rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.89). Three studies involved 3952 children. In children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia, oral antibiotics (amoxycillin/co-trimoxazole) compared with injectable penicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.24), hospitalisation rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.34) and relapse rates (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). Six studies involved 4331 children below 18 years of age. In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). One study involved 1116 children.

Authors' Conclusions

For treatment of patients with CAP in ambulatory settings, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. Children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia can be treated with oral amoxycillin in an ambulatory setting. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as second-line therapies. There is a need for more studies with radiographically confirmed pneumonia in larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics. Recommendations in this review are applicable to countries with high case fatalities due to pneumonia in children without underlying morbidities and where point of care tests for identification of aetiological agents for pneumonia are not available.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^1310d877]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the northern hemisphere about 12/1000 people a year (on average) contract pneumonia while living in the community, with most cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mortality ranges from about 5% to 35% depending on severity of disease, with a worse prognosis in older people, men, and people with chronic diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent community-acquired pneumonia? What are the effects of treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient settings, in people admitted to hospital, and in people receiving intensive care? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, intravenous), different combinations, and prompt administration of antibiotics in intensive-care settings, early mobilisation, influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine.

In the northern hemisphere about 12/1000 people a year (on average) contract pneumonia while living in the community, with most cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mortality ranges from about 5–35% depending on severity of disease, with a worse prognosis in older people, men, and people with chronic diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent community-acquired pneumonia? What are the effects of treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient settings, in people admitted to hospital, and in people receiving intensive care? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, intravenous), different combinations, and prompt administration of antibiotics in intensive-care settings, early mobilisation, influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine.

### A multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of ceftaroline compared with ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in pediatric patients with complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia [^1f133217]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftaroline, a metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, has shown in vitro activity against clinical isolates from pediatric patients.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study (NCT01669980) assessed the safety and effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil compared with ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in patients between 2 months and 17 years of age with complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Patients were randomized 3:1 (stratified by age cohort) to receive either ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (comparator) as intravenous therapy for ≥ 3 days. Patients who met specific study criteria on or after Study Day 4 were permitted to switch to an oral study drug. Safety assessments were treatment-emergent adverse events, and the effectiveness of treatment was assessed by clinical and microbiologic outcomes.

Results

The median duration of intravenous treatment was 9.0 (range, 3.0–19.0) days in the ceftaroline fosamil group (N = 30) and 7.5 (5.0–13.0) days in the comparator group (N = 10). At least one treatment-emergent adverse event was experienced by 12/30 patients (40%) in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 8/10 (80%) in the comparator group; most treatment-emergent adverse events in both groups were mild to moderate in intensity. Clinical response rates in the modified intent-to-treat population were 52% (15/29 patients) in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 67% in the comparator group (6/9); clinical stability at Study Day 4 was 21% (6/29) and 22% (2/9), respectively.

Conclusions

Ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated and showed similar clinical response rates to ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in pediatric patients with complicated community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

### A randomized controlled trial of hospital versus home based therapy with oral amoxicillin for severe pneumonia in children aged 3–59 months: the indiaCLEN severe pneumonia oral therapy (ISPOT) study [^793e3809]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the single largest killer of children under the age of five worldwide. The disease kills over two million children under the age of five every year — nearly one fourth (400,000) of these deaths occur in India alone. About half of pneumonia cases in India are caused by bacteria and could be treated with antibiotics. However, only 13% of Indian children under the age of five with suspected pneumonia receive antibiotics.

The 2008 WHO guidelines for treatment of non-severe pneumonia (cough, fever and fast breathing) recommend health workers to provide oral antibiotics for three days at home but urgent referral for hospitalization for parenteral (injectable) antibiotics and other supportive therapy after administration of first dose of antibiotics, if the child has severe pneumonia (cough, fever, fast breathing and lower chest indrawing) or very severe disease (pneumonia with the presence of WHO defined danger signs). Often inability to access a referral facility deprives these children from getting appropriate care. For many families, seeking treatment for their children at a health care facility is often logistically and financially burdensome thus denying them early administration of antibiotics within 48 h that can potentially improve their outcomes. Additionally transport to a distant facility can entail serious delays in effective treatment. Many children with severe pneumonia referred for admission to a hospital could die in transit or reach too sick to be saved. In addition, when hospitalized, the children with severe pneumonia are vulnerable to nosocomial infections in crowded hospital wards and are also at risk of needle-borne infections due to parenteral therapy. Two important studies have addressed such barriers to the recommended treatment of severe pneumonia. The first study was intended to determine whether oral antibiotics are equivalent to injectable antibiotics when both are given in the hospital. This was an open label equivalency study called APPIS (Amoxicillin Penicillin Pneumonia International Study), which was a large multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing injectable penicillin versus oral amoxicillin given for 7 days to children in the hospital. The second study was called "NO-SHOTS" (New Outpatient Short-Course Home Oral Therapy for Severe Pneumonia Study) and was a randomized, open-label equivalency trial done at seven study sites in Pakistan and compared initial hospitalization and parenteral ampicillin for 48 h followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin at home, to 5 days of home-based treatment with oral amoxicillin. NO-SHOTS showed that home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin is equivalent to hospital based treatment with parenteral ampicillin in selected children aged 3–59 months with WHO defined severe pneumonia. Later, another study- the MASS study (Multicenter Amoxicillin Severe pneumonia Study) showed that clinical treatment failure and adverse event rates among children with severe pneumonia treated at home with oral amoxicillin did not substantially differ across geographic areas (Bangladesh, Ghana, Vietnam and Egypt) and hence home-based therapy of severe pneumonia could possibly be applied to a wide variety of settings. Thus oral amoxicillin at home has proven clinically efficacious in various settings across the world for treatment of selected children with WHO defined severe pneumonia. The Lancet Series on Childhood Pneumonia and Diarrhoea has reported that case management is one of the three most effective interventions to reduce pneumonia deaths in children but also noted that the cost effectiveness of these interventions in national health systems needs urgent assessment. So the cost savings or cost-effectiveness of home-based oral antibiotic treatment for WHO defined severe pneumonia in childhood would be important to inform public policy and has not been previously evaluated.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia — empiric outpatient oral therapy in persons with HIV notes that empiric antimicrobial therapy should be initiated promptly for patients presenting with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Preferred therapy is an oral beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate. Alternative beta-lactams are cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin)a (AI), especially for patients with penicillin allergies.

### Challenges in the design of antibiotic equivalency studies: the multicenter equivalency study of oral amoxicillin versus injectable penicillin in children aged 3–59 months with severe pneumonia [^272188e0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children with severe pneumonia (characterized by cough or difficult breathing, as well as lower chest wall indrawing) be hospitalized and treated with parenteral penicillin. Oral amoxicillin, if equally effective for treating severe pneumonia, would address challenges associated with providing parenteral therapy, including risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens from contaminated needles, exposure to nosocomial pathogens during hospitalization, inadequate access to health care facilities, and cost. The recently completed multicenter international trial of oral amoxicillin versus parenteral penicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia demonstrated the equivalency of these agents in children with severe pneumonia. This article focuses on the challenges of designing an equivalence study and the threats to the validity of the trial results, particularly the implications of the bias toward finding equivalence when subjects are unlikely to respond to either study therapy. These considerations have implications for use of the Amoxicillin Penicillin Pneumonia International Study (APPIS) results in clinical practice and for potential modification of WHO treatment guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d3e0a451]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of Asian patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial [^b36ef63a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone with or without a macrolide antibiotic is a recommended treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline fosamil compared with ceftriaxone in the treatment of Asian patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In this international, randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial, adult Asian patients with Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III-IV acute community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg every 12 h) or ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) for 5–7 days. Patients were randomly assigned via centralised telephone and web-based system; patients and treating clinicians were masked to treatment allocation. Investigators who did study assessments remained masked to treatment allocation until completion of the study. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (8–15 days after last dose of study drug) in the clinically evaluable population. Non-inferiority of ceftaroline fosamil was defined as a lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the proportion of patients clinically cured of -10% or higher; if non-inferiority was achieved, superiority was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01371838.

Findings

Between Dec 13, 2011, and April 26, 2013, 847 patients were enrolled at 64 centres in China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, of whom 771 were randomly assigned and 764 received study treatment. In the clinically evaluable population (n = 498) 217 (84%) of 258 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 178 (74%) of 240 patients in the ceftriaxone group were clinically cured at the test-of-cure visit (difference 9.9%, 95% CI 2.8–17.1). The superiority of ceftaroline fosamil was consistent across all preplanned patient subgroup analyses (split by age 65 years, age 75 years, sex, PORT risk class, and previous antibiotic use) apart from patients younger than 65 years. The frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups and the safety results for ceftaroline fosamil were consistent with the cephalosporin class and previous clinical trial data.

Interpretation

Ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg given every 12 h was superior to ceftriaxone 2 g given every 24 h for the treatment of Asian patients with PORT III-IV community-acquired pneumonia. These data suggest that ceftaroline fosamil should be regarded as an alternative to ceftriaxone in empirical treatment regimens for this patient population.

### Clinical and microbiological end points in the treatment of pneumonia [^f3a2c712]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration is reviewing its criteria for evaluating new antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. Although there are descriptions of hundreds of comparative studies of various antimicrobials, there is surprisingly little scientific literature on how the evaluations should be done. This brief contribution outlines areas for further consideration as new drugs are evaluated.

### A randomized, prospective study of pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated with ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone [^9bf1e9a9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) remains a major infection among children, despite the use of pneumococcal vaccination. Ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic with activity against many bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-nonsusceptible and multidrug-resistant strains) and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus). This article describes the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of pediatric patients hospitalized with CABP, from a randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded clinical study (registration number NCT01530763).

Methods

Pediatric patients were stratified into 4 age cohorts and randomized (3:1) to receive either intravenous ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone, with optional oral switch for a total treatment duration of 5–14 days. Enrollment was planned for 160 patients. Data collected included demographics, infection characteristics and pathogens. Treatment-emergent adverse events, clinical outcomes, and microbiologic responses were assessed.

Results

Ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated. Similar percentages of patients in the ceftaroline fosamil (55/121; 45%) and ceftriaxone (18/39; 46%) groups reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Coombs seroconversion was observed in 17% of patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group; however, no evidence of hemolytic anemia or hemolysis was found. No deaths were reported during the study. Ceftaroline fosamil had similar effectiveness to ceftriaxone, with high clinical cure rates at test-of-cure in the modified intent-to-treat population (94/107; 88% and 32/36; 89%, respectively). Three documented S. aureus infections were successfully treated in the ceftaroline group, including one caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that ceftaroline fosamil may be an important treatment option for pediatric patients hospitalized with CABP.

### Overview of recent studies of community-acquired pneumonia [^bb6d5cd4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

All recent studies of antibacterial drugs for the indication of community-acquired pneumonia submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration have been designed as noninferiority studies. We provide a summary of results of 7 recent clinical studies of oral antibacterial drugs for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. In these 7 studies, the majority of patients enrolled had Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team scores of I or II. The percentage of randomized subjects with pathogens identified at baseline ranged from 47% to 76%, and the percentage of subjects with Streptoccocus pneumoniae isolated at baseline ranged from approximately 6% to 20%. The primary end point in these studies was clinical cure, assessed 7–21 days after completion of therapy. Clinical cure rates were > 80% in the intent-to-treat populations and > 90% in the per-protocol populations. We also briefly summarize the results from several recently submitted clinical studies of intravenously administered antibacterial drugs for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, in which we found similar results.

### Oral gemifloxacin versus sequential therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone / oral cefuroxime with or without a macrolide in the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized, open-label, multicenter study of clinical efficacy and tolerability [^66a3498e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral gemifloxacin, an enhanced-affinity quinolone, with sequential therapy with IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cefuroxime (with or without a macrolide) in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

A randomized, open-label, multicenter study comprised adults hospitalized with a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of CAP. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either (1) oral gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily (7–14 days); or (2) IV ceftriaxone 2 g once daily (1–7 days) followed by oral cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily (1–13 days) for a total of ≤ 14 days. Patients receiving ceftriaxone/cefuroxime were allowed concomitant macrolide treatment.

Results

A total of 345 patients were randomized, of whom 341 received at least 1 dose of study medication (gemifloxacin, 169/172; ceftriaxone/cefuroxime, 172/173). Clinical success rates in the clinically evaluable (CE) population at follow-up (day 21–28 post-therapy), the primary end point, were 92.2% (107/116) for gemifloxacin and 93.4% (113/121) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime (treatment difference, -1.15; 95% CI, -7.73 to 5.43). In patients in Fine risk classes IV and V, the clinical success rate was 87.0% (20/23) for gemifloxacin versus 83.3% (20/24) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime. No difference in clinical response at follow-up was noted based on macrolide use. Bacteriologic success rates at follow-up in the bacteriologically evaluable (BE) population were 90.6% (58/64) for gemifloxacin and 87.3% (55/63) for ceftriaxone/cefuroxime (treatment difference 3.32; 95% CI, -7.57 to 14.21). The clinical success rate in bacteremic patients at follow-up (BE population) was 100.0%. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. The frequency and types of adverse events were similar between the 2 groups. The most common treatment-related adverse events with gemifloxacin were diarrhea, liver-function adverse events, and rash; with ceftriaxone/cefuroxime, they were diarrhea, elevated hepatic-enzyme activity, and moniliasis.

Conclusion

The clinical efficacy and tolerability of oral gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily were similar to those of IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cefuroxime (with or without a macrolide) in the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe CAP. Both treatments were effective in bacteremic patients and those at increased risk of mortality.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^f3594bdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Outpatient prescribing pattern for acute bronchitis in primary healthcare settings in China [^f4f2a5e5]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Among all single-antibiotic prescriptions, 91.5% were broad-spectrum formulations, and second- and third-generation cephalosporins were the most prescribed categories. This was consistent with previous findings in Chinese hospitals for treating respiratory tract infections. This preference for broad-spectrum cephalosporins was also found in the US and European countries. As noted in previous studies, cephalosporins should be avoided when a narrow-spectrum antibiotic would be effective. Inappropriate antibiotic use accelerated the development of antibiotic resistance such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Cephalosporin overuse in Chinese primary healthcare outpatient settings may be largely due to the requirement of mandatory skin testing before prescribing either oral or injectable penicillins for all patients. Ideally, skin testing can increase the number of incidents in which penicillin can be safely administered rather than alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, in clinical practice, overestimation of penicillin allergy rates, along with the inconvenience and unreliable results of penicillin skin testing, may actually impel some primary healthcare clinicians to replace penicillins with cephalosporins or other broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Appropriate use of antimicrobial agents: challenges and strategies for improvement [^ceea9e12]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The use of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy is common in intensive care unit patients and contributes to a number of poor outcomes. Selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy is complicated by many factors, including the large number of agents available, the presence of resistant organisms, and the general desire among practitioners to use the most focused therapy available. An important aspect of appropriate antimicrobial use is prompt initiation of adequate empirical therapy, which has been shown to improve mortality rates in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and other serious infections. Other key strategies include streamlining antimicrobial therapy when a pathogen is identified and switching from intravenous to oral therapy when clinically indicated. In addition, antibiotic rotation (or cycling) has been evaluated in several trials as a means to minimize resistance. Promoting appropriate antimicrobial therapy ultimately will require a multidisciplinary, system-oriented, institution-specific approach because each intensive care unit has its own unique flora and antimicrobial resistance patterns.

### Treatment for community acquired pneumonia: more support for doxycycline… [^d9caa60f]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

In reply We appreciate the positive comments of Drs Ditmanson and Apgar. In response to their specific questions, the patients were not followed-up in a systematic fashion after discharge, although many of these patients were seen in the outpatient clinic. On careful review, none of the patients were readmitted to the hospital with relapse or recurrence of pneumonia within 30 days. In response to the second question, the patients were given a prescription for oral antibiotics for the follow-up therapy: doxycycline for the doxycycline group and other appropriate regimens for control group patients, The cost difference between the doxycycline and the control group for the follow-up oral therapy was not calculated. We believe this was probably a significant difference although less dramatic than the cost difference for the inpatient therapy. Ailani RK, Agastya G, Ailani R, Mukunda BN, Shekar R.

### Systematic review on antibiotic therapy for pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age [^664a104d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a force to reckon with, as it accounts for 1.1 million of all deaths in children less than 5 years of age globally, with disproportionately higher mortality occurring in the low and middle income-countries (LMICs) of Southeast Asia and Africa. Existing strategies to curb pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality have not effectively translated into meaningful control of pneumonia-related burden. In the present systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of trials conducted in LMICs to determine the most suitable antibiotic therapy for treating pneumonia (very severe, severe and non-severe). While previous reviews, including the most recent review by Lodha et al, have focused either on single modality of antibiotic therapy (such as choice of antibiotic) or children under the age of 16 years, the current review updates evidence on the choice of drug, duration, route and combination of antibiotics in children specifically between 2 and 59 months of age. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the route, dose, combination and duration of antibiotics in the management of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP. Study participants included children between 2 and 59 months of age with CAP. All available titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by two review authors independently. All data was entered and analysed using Review Manager 5 software. The review identified 8122 studies on initial search, of which 22 studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. Evidence from these trials showed a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin to be effective for managing very severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age, and oral amoxicillin to be equally efficacious, as other parenteral antibiotics for managing severe pneumonia in children of this particular age group. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia as well. The review further found a short 3 day course of antibiotics to be equally beneficial as 5 day course for managing non-severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age. This review updates evidence on the general spectrum of antibiotic recommendation for CAP in children between 2 and 59 months of age, which is an age group that warrants special focus owing to its high disease and mortality burden. Evidence derived from the review found oral amoxicillin to be equally effective as parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in the 2–59 month age group, which holds important implications for LMICs where parenteral drug administration is an issue. Also, the review's finding that 3 day course of antibiotic is equally effective as 5 day course for non-severe pneumonia for 2–59 months of age is again beneficial for LMICs, as a shorter therapy will be associated with a lower cost. The review addresses some research gaps in antibiotic treatment for CAP as well, and this crucial information is presented with the aim of providing a targeted cure for the middle and low income setting.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^6662c42d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship

Ideally, antibiotic stewardship in ICUs should include the rapid identification of bacterial etiology, optimization of treatment based on PK/PD characteristics of the antibiotic(s), avoidance of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics, shortening of treatment duration, and reduction in the number of patients receiving antibiotic therapy for non-infectious syndromes. To achieve this, ICUs should continuously collect data and adjust prescribing of beta-lactam backbone antibiotics according to their local resistance patterns. Delayed appropriate therapy is consistently associated with worse outcomes. In contrast, early and appropriate empiric broad-spectrum therapy, followed by de-escalation, is generally associated with improved clinical outcomes for pneumonia. To achieve adequate therapy, it is necessary to select the correct antibiotic(s), an optimal dose, and the correct route of administration (oral, IV, or aerosol) to ensure antibiotic penetration to the site of infection.

Guidelines advise that de-escalation of antibiotics be considered once information is available on the results of lower respiratory tract cultures and the patient's clinical response. A meta-analysis that included three studies in patients with VAP showed that, in some patients, the use of short-course (2- to 3-day) therapy as a de-escalation approach (compared with prolonged-course therapy) was not associated with an increase in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or hospital stay, particularly in those not infected with non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. While the optimal length of antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients with VAP due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli remains an unsolved issue, clinicians should strive to stop therapy as soon as possible.

De-escalation of therapy may be guided by scores such as the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 81 patients with a CPIS of less than 6 (implying low likelihood of pneumonia) were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy (at discretion of physician) or ciprofloxacin monotherapy, with re-evaluation at day 3; ciprofloxacin was discontinued if CPIS remained less than 6 at day 3. Mortality, length of ICU stay, and development of resistance did not differ significantly between treatments, actually favoring the ciprofloxacin monotherapy arm.

Biomarkers offer an alternative method to shorten duration of therapy. Several large randomized trials in critically ill patients of antibiotic duration based on falling procalcitonin levels have demonstrated that this approach can safely shorten duration without adverse consequences. HAP/VAP were common types of infection in these studies.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^4c6d32e9]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTEXT

Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in young infants.

OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens to treat young infant pneumonia on critical clinical outcomes.

DATA SOURCES

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Registry of Trials.

STUDY SELECTION

We included randomized controlled trials of young infants aged 0 to 59 days with pneumonia (population) comparing the efficacy of antibiotic regimens (intervention) with alternate regimens or management (control) on clinical outcomes.

DATA EXTRACTION

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to assess certainty of evidence.

LIMITATIONS

Trials were heterogeneous, which precluded data pooling.

RESULTS

Of 2601 publications screened, 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Seven trials were hospital-based (n = 869) and 3 were nonhospital-based (n = 4329). No hospital-based trials evaluated WHO-recommended first-choice regimens. One trial found the WHO-recommended second-choice antibiotic, cefotaxime, to have similar rates of treatment success as non-WHO-recommended regimens of either amoxicillin–clavulanate (RR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.82–1.10) or amoxicillin–clavulanate/cefotaxime (RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.86–1.12). Among 3 nonhospital-based trials comparing oral amoxicillin to alternate regimens to treat isolated tachypnea among infants aged 7–59 days, there were no differences in treatment failure between amoxicillin and alternate regimens. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for all primary outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

We found limited evidence to support the superiority of any single antibiotic regimen over alternate regimens to treat young infant pneumonia.

### Penicillins for treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia: does in vitro resistance really matter? [^5f4e7c63]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The rate of in vitro bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is escalating among pathogens that cause the most serious respiratory tract infections. Many reports published during the past few years suggest that this has direct clinical implications. In particular, resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy has assumed a prominent role in the evolution of guidelines for the initial treatment of respiratory tract infection.

Methods

I conducted a critical review of the published medical literature.

Results

There is only a single report of documented microbiologic failure of parenteral penicillin-class antibiotics in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in patients with or without bacteremia, whereas there are numerous well-documented reports of treatment failure with quinolone-class (n ≥ 21) and macrolide-class (n ≥ 33) antibiotics in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia.

Conclusion

The recommended optimal in-hospital therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should continue to be a beta-lactam antibiotic (penicillin, aminopenicillin, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) administered with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone agent for adjunctive treatment of infection with potential atypical pathogens.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^e2c9b1fb]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

To assess the associations between 3 key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Evidence Review

Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

Findings

Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among 8 observational studies identified, the 4 largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the 4 smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6% (1-sided 90% CI upper limit, 13.0%) in attainment of clinical stability on hospital day 7 favoring β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy. Six of 8 observational studies (study populations of 1188 to 24,780) found that β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy was associated with relative reductions of 26% to 68% in short-term mortality and all 3 observational studies (study populations of 2068 to 24,780) reported that fluoroquinolone monotherapy was associated with relative reductions of 30% to 43% in mortality compared with β-lactam monotherapy. One randomized trial (n = 302) reported significantly reduced hospital length of stay (absolute difference, 1.9 days; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.2 days), but no differences in treatment failure when objective clinical criteria were used to decide when to transition patients from intravenous to oral therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotic therapy consisting of β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy initiated within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality, supported predominantly by low-quality observational studies. One randomized trial supports the use of objective clinical criteria to guide the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^c8a887ea]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in young infants.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens to treat young infant pneumonia on critical clinical outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Registry of Trials.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled trials of young infants aged 0 to 59 days with pneumonia (population) comparing the efficacy of antibiotic regimens (intervention) with alternate regimens or management (control) on clinical outcomes.

Data Extraction

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to assess certainty of evidence.

Limitations

Trials were heterogeneous, which precluded data pooling.

Results

Of 2601 publications screened, 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Seven trials were hospital-based (n = 869) and 3 were nonhospital-based (n = 4329). No hospital-based trials evaluated WHO-recommended first-choice regimens. One trial found the WHO-recommended second-choice antibiotic, cefotaxime, to have similar rates of treatment success as non-WHO-recommended regimens of either amoxicillin-clavulanate (RR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.82–1.10) or amoxicillin-clavulanate/cefotaxime (RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.86–1.12). Among 3 nonhospital-based trials comparing oral amoxicillin to alternate regimens to treat isolated tachypnea among infants aged 7–59 days, there were no differences in treatment failure between amoxicillin and alternate regimens. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for all primary outcomes.

Conclusions

We found limited evidence to support the superiority of any single antibiotic regimen over alternate regimens to treat young infant pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^8d887f20]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Ertapenem [^2e77a487]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Community Acquired Pneumonia

Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in two randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trials. Both trials compared ertapenem (1 g parenterally once a day) with ceftriaxone (1 g parenterally once a day) and enrolled a total of 866 patients. Both regimens allowed the option to switch to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment (parenteral and oral). In the first trial the primary efficacy parameter was the clinical success rate in the clinically evaluable population and success rates were 92.3% (168/182) for ertapenem and 91% (183/201) for ceftriaxone at 7 to 14 days posttherapy (test-of-cure). In the second trial the primary efficacy parameter was the clinical success rate in the microbiologically evaluable population and success rates were 91% (91/100) for ertapenem and 91.8% (45/49) for ceftriaxone at 7 to 14 days posttherapy (test-of-cure).

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections Including Pyelonephritis

Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis in two randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trials. Both trials compared ertapenem (1 g parenterally once a day) with ceftriaxone (1 g parenterally once a day) and enrolled a total of 850 patients. Both regimens allowed the option to switch to oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment (parenteral and oral). The microbiological success rates (combined trials) at 5 to 9 days posttherapy (test-of-cure) were 89.5% (229/256) for ertapenem and 91.1% (204/224) for ceftriaxone.

### Editorial commentary: ambulatory management of chest-indrawing pneumonia [^17beb595]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To address this evidence gap, a randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Pakistan comparing oral cotrimoxazole with oral amoxicillin for treatment of fast-breathing and chest-indrawing pneumonia, which showed that clinical treatment failure rates were equivalent for fast-breathing pneumonia, but amoxicillin was superior to cotrimoxazole in treating chest-indrawing (82% vs 67% cure rate, respectively). This led to the Amoxicillin Penicillin Pneumonia International Study (APPIS) multicenter trial in Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, Vietnam, and Zambia comparing oral amoxicillin to injectable penicillin for treatment of chest-indrawing pneumonia, which showed that both regimens were equivalent for clinical treatment outcomes. The pneumonia intravenous oral antibiotic treatment multicenter trial in England compared oral amoxicillin with intravenous penicillin in children hospitalized with severe pneumonia and found treatment outcomes to be equivalent. This study was unique in that it was conducted in a highly industrialized setting and enrolled only radiologically confirmed cases.

These carefully conducted studies generated the evidence base demonstrating that oral amoxicillin was both superior to cotrimoxazole and equivalent to injectable penicillin for treatment of chest-indrawing pneumonia. Proposed as justification for changing WHO policy to move case management to an outpatient setting, these studies were considered insufficient because they were all done in a hospital setting. To address this shortfall, the new outpatient short course home oral therapy for severe pneumonia (NO-SHOTS) multicenter trial compared oral amoxicillin treatment at home on an outpatient basis to injectable ampicillin in the hospital and reported equivalence in treatment outcomes and similar safety profiles. This trial was further supported by safety data from an observational multicenter study in Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana, and Vietnam showing low treatment failure rates across communities and geographic regions.

In 2012, after considering this new evidence utilizing the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group process, the WHO guidelines development panel strongly recommended that oral amoxicillin be used to treat chest-indrawing pneumonia (without danger signs) as outpatient treatment in low-HIV settings, whereas in high-HIV settings, such children should be referred for hospitalization and injectable therapy. This recommendation should bring access to treatment for more children with pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries and reduce hospitalizations, but more evidence is needed to determine whether outpatient care is as effective as hospital-based care across diverse settings.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to duration of antibiotic therapy, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to decide on the duration of antibiotic therapy based on validated measures of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities, normal mentation, and ability to tolerate oral intake) Continue antibiotics until the patient achieves stability and for at least 5 days in patients with CAP.

### Efficacy and safety of oral and early-switch therapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^3add22c3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine the safety, efficacy, and cost of oral therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In patients with nonsevere pneumonia, conventional (parenteral) treatment was compared with the oral route; in patients with severe pneumonia, conventional treatment was compared with early switch from parenteral to oral therapy.

Subjects and Methods

We randomly assigned 85 hospitalized patients with nonsevere pneumonia to one of two groups: 41 received oral antimicrobials from admission, and 44 received parenteral antimicrobials until they had been afebrile for 72 hours before switching to oral treatment. We randomly assigned 103 patients with severe pneumonia who had initially been treated with parenteral antimicrobials to one of two groups: 48 were switched to oral therapy after 48 hours of treatment (early switch), and 55 received a full 10-day course of parenteral antibiotics.

Results

Among patients with nonsevere pneumonia, there were no deaths in the oral treatment group, and one death (2%) in the parenteral treatment group (95% confidence interval [CI] for between-group [oral minus parenteral] difference: -7% to 2%, P = 0.3). The time to resolution of morbidity was ≤ 5 days in 34 (83%) patients in the oral treatment group and 39 (88%) patients in the parenteral treatment group (P = 0.5); there were treatment failures in 4 (10%) patients in the oral treatment group and 14 (32%) patients in the parenteral treatment group (P = 0.02). Among patients with severe pneumonia, there was one (2%) death in the early-switch group and no deaths in the full course of parenteral antibiotics groups (95% CI for between-group [early switch vs. full course] difference: -2% to 6%, P = 0.5). The time to resolution of morbidity was ≤ 5 days in 38 (79%) patients in the early-switch group and 41 (75%) in the full-course group (P = 0.3). There were 12 (25%) treatment failures in the early-switch group and 13 (24%) in the full-course group (P = 0.9). There were fewer adverse events in the oral and early-switch groups, primarily due to lower rates of infusion-related phlebitis. Significant cost savings, mainly due to a shorter hospitalization, occurred among patients with severe pneumonia in the early-switch group.

Conclusion

Inpatients with nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia can be effectively and safely treated with oral antimicrobials from the time of admission, whereas those with severe pneumonia can be treated with early-switch therapy.

### Editorial commentary: ambulatory management of chest-indrawing pneumonia [^61d4a544]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

This is why Agweyu et al's study is so important, as it shows that oral therapy is as effective and safe as injectable therapy even in a high-mortality setting. Restricting this approach to children with chest-indrawing pneumonia, in the absence of danger signs, identifies the subset of children with lower mortality, as was seen here as well as in APPIS and NO-SHOTS. Although this includes cases of viral infection and bronchospastic disease, there are also certainly some bacterial pneumonia or mixed viral–bacterial infections for which antibiotics are appropriate. Early initiation of oral antibiotics in the community has recently been shown to be superior to more delayed referral for hospital treatment with injectable antibiotics, thus supporting the role of antibiotic treatment in this population.

Recently, critics have restated old concerns that antibiotic trials such as these cannot truly determine equivalence in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia due to the unavoidable inclusion of patients with viral infection, which creates a bias toward the null that can make 2 treatments appear equivalent, even if one is superior (Pollyanna phenomenon). We previously addressed this criticism in part. Although it is true that Agweyu's study cannot be used as evidence that oral therapy is as effective as injectable therapy for treatment of pure bacterial pneumonia, this is not the issue. Agweyu et al's study, and the other chest-indrawing pneumonia equivalence studies, show it is safe and no less effective to treat this relatively low-mortality subset of childhood pneumonias at home on an outpatient basis as in the hospital. Ambulatory treatment of pneumonia with oral antibiotic allows earlier treatment initiation, lower costs to the healthcare system and patients, reduced iatrogenic complications associated with hospitalization, and lowered burden on family members from prolonged hospitalization, at the risk of overtreatment of nonbacterial pneumonias with antibiotics. Until there are sufficient tools to diagnose bacterial pneumonia in low-resource facilities or in the community, this approach will reach more children, including those with mild bacterial pneumonia or cases of viral pneumonia at risk of bacterial secondary infection. Although there may be considerations about the most robust methodologies for this type of research, these data provide an appropriate and pragmatic way forward for management of childhood pneumonia.

### Simplified antibiotic regimens for the management of clinically diagnosed severe infections in newborns and young infants in first-level facilities in karachi, Pakistan: study design for an outpatient randomized controlled equivalence trial [^6c4dfd9a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses of use of oral antibiotics for neonatal pneumonia management in community settings also suggest an effect on overall and pneumonia-specific mortality. A recent review of the impact of case management strategies on mortality among newborns with sepsis or pneumonia found 4 trials evaluating oral antibiotics for neonatal pneumonia in nonrandomized, concurrently controlled designs. A meta-analysis of these studies suggested reductions in all-cause neonatal mortality [relative risk 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–0.89; 4 studies] and neonatal pneumonia-specific mortality (relative risk 0.58; 95% CI: 0.41–0.82; 3 studies).

A consultation of WHO, Save the Children/Saving Newborn Lives, United States Agency for International Development, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and newborn health experts convened to discuss on newborn infection case management guidelines for community settings in London in 2007. The group recommended future research to evaluate different combination oral and IM antibiotic regimens, or injectable to oral "switch" regimens that would be feasible in weak health systems for use in first-level facility and home-based management algorithms, would be acceptable to families and show treatment success rates as close as possible to the current standard regimen of injectable gentamicin and penicillin for 7–10 days.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^a1327358]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pathogen-specific antimicrobial considerations for pediatric acute bacterial arthritis include that for oral therapy of CA-MRSA ABA, clindamycin is the preferred agent for susceptible MRSA strains and limited data exist for linezolid, TMP/SMX, doxycycline, or minocycline; K. kingae is generally susceptible to penicillins (with the notable exception of anti-staphylococcal penicillins), cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and TMP/SMX, while strains are resistant to kanamycin and often resistant to clindamycin and linezolid; for penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates and S. pyogenes, penicillin or ampicillin are the preferred parenteral beta-lactam agents, with phenoxymethyl penicillin or amoxicillin for oral therapy; for pneumococci reported as penicillin-non-susceptible, high dose parenteral penicillin has been used for pneumococcal pneumonia with penicillin MICs as high as 8.0 μg/mL, and for oral treatment pneumococci with a penicillin or ampicillin MIC < 2 mg/L are considered susceptible for the treatment of ABA, while cefotaxime/ceftriaxone should be effective if the pneumococcal isolate is reported as susceptible by the laboratory (MIC ≤ 1 mcg/ml for infections other than meningitis) but is much broader spectrum than penicillin or amoxicillin; in vitro testing may reveal additional options including clindamycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, levofloxacin, or daptomycin, and five of 24 pneumococcal isolates (21%) from children with osteoarticular infections from 2010 through 2015 in a single center study were resistant to clindamycin; Hib is now a rare etiology where Hib conjugate vaccines are routine, but invasive disease continues, beta-lactamase positivity varies, parenteral ampicillin may be used for beta-lactamase negative strains, parenteral second (cefuroxime) or third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftriaxone/cefixime) may be used as alternatives or for beta-lactamase producing isolates, for oral convalescent therapy for beta-lactamase negative strains amoxicillin should be used, and oral second (cefuroxime) and third generation cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefditoren) or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate) should provide effective.

### Treatment with sequential intravenous or oral moxifloxacin was associated with faster clinical improvement than was standard therapy for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received initial parenteral therapy [^70e70807]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (CTRX), and pneumococcal fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin (MXF), are currently recommended first-line antibiotics for empirical treatment of inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, CTRX and MXF have never undergone a head-to-head comparison. We therefore compared the efficacy, safety, and speed and quality of defervescence of sequential intravenous or oral MXF and high-dose CTRX with or without erythromycin (CTRX ± ERY) for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring parenteral therapy.

Methods

In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study, 397 patients were randomly assigned to receive either MXF (400 mg once daily intravenously, possibly followed by oral tablets) or CTRX (2 g intravenously once daily) with or without ERY (1 g intravenously every 6–8 h) for 7–14 days.

Results

Among 317 patients evaluable for efficacy and safety, 138 (85.7%) of 161 MXF-treated patients and 135 (86.5%) of 156 CTRX ± ERY-treated patients (59 [37.8%] of whom received CTRX and ERY) achieved continued clinical resolution. Defervescence and relief of symptoms, such as chest pain, occurred significantly earlier in the MXF-treated group than in the CTRX ± ERY-treated group. Both regimens were generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

For adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, sequential MXF therapy was clinically equivalent to high-dose CTRX ± ERY therapy but led to a faster clinical improvement.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^95695080]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

While 47 hospitals contributed data to HMS, 6 were excluded for participating in less than half of the study period (23 February 2017 through 5 February 2020), leaving 41 hospitals for our analysis (87%). Hospitals that dropped out were similar to those that participated (Supplementary Table 1). There were 6553 patients with uncomplicated CAP who were eligible for a 5-day duration and included in this study (see Supplementary Table 2 for patient characteristics). The most common empiric antibiotics were ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. The most common discharge antibiotics were azithromycin, oral cephalosporins, and levofloxacin. Over the study period both empiric and discharge fluoroquinolone use decreased, replaced largely by cephalosporin and β-lactam use (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B).

Over the study period, 34.0% of patients eligible for a 5-day duration (2228 of 6553) received an appropriate 5 ± 1–day duration. Proportions of patients with uncomplicated CAP treated with an appropriate 5-day duration ranged from 10.0% to 69.0% across hospitals; hospitals that were academic, nonprofit, larger, or part of a statewide healthcare system had higher rates of appropriate 5-day treatment (Table 1).

### Ertapenem therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly [^d577c50f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of ertapenem, 1 g once a day, with ceftriaxone, 1 g once a day, for treatment of the subgroup of patients aged 65 and older with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring parenteral therapy.

Design

Combined data from patients aged 65 and older in two randomized, double-blind clinical trials.

Setting

Eighty international centers.

Participants

Eight hundred fifty-seven treated patients, of whom 351 were aged 65 and older.

Interventions

Intravenous or intramuscular ertapenem or ceftriaxone with the option to switch to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate after at least 3 days of parenteral therapy.

Measurements

Clinical efficacy was assessed at completion of parenteral therapy and 7 to 14 days after all therapy had been completed (test of cure (TOC) assessment). Bacterial eradication was assessed at the TOC visit. Safety was assessed daily during study therapy and for 14 days thereafter.

Results

One hundred forty-eight clinically evaluable patients aged 65 and older were treated with ertapenem and 125 with ceftriaxone. Pathogens were identified in 157 (57.5%) patients (the most common being Streptococcus pneumoniae), most of which were penicillin-susceptible. Clinical cure rates were 95.9% for patients in the ertapenem group and 92.7% for patients in the ceftriaxone group at completion of parenteral therapy and 93.9% and 90.4%, respectively, at the TOC assessment. Overall bacterial eradication rates were 92.8% (77 of 83) for patients treated with ertapenem and 93.2% (69 of 74) for those treated with ceftriaxone. The most common drug-related adverse experiences in both treatment groups were diarrhea and mild to moderate elevation of serum aminotransferase levels.

Conclusion

Ertapenem 1 g once a day was highly effective for treatment of elderly patients with CAP requiring parenteral therapy and was as effective as ceftriaxone. Ertapenem was generally well tolerated, with an overall safety profile similar to ceftriaxone.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^b823f45a]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

(c) Antibiotic treatment of very severe pneumonia: chloramphenicol versus benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin

Two trials compared the effectiveness of benzyl penicillin/ampicillin combined with gentamicin versus chloramphenicol for very severe pneumonia. Duke et al (2002) studied 1116 children in Papua New Guinea while Asghar et al (2008) recruited 958 children from eight sites in seven developing countries. A meta-analysis of the two studies yielded a pooled risk ratio of treatment failure of 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.94 in favor of penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin.

(d) Antibiotic treatment of very severe pneumonia: benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin versus ceftriaxone

We found no experimental data directly comparing outcomes following treatment of very severe childhood pneumonia using the recommended antibiotics against ceftriaxone, a common regimen used by clinicians in Kenya. One small trial (n = 97) from Turkey compared benzyl penicillin combined with chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone at day 10 of treatment for radiologically-confirmed severe and very severe pneumonia while another small trial (n = 71) compared intravenous benzyl penicillin combined with gentamicin with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate in Indian children with severe hypoxemic pneumonia. Neither trial reported a superior regimen. Failure to report on the process of randomization and allocation concealment in the study conducted in Turkey was considered a serious limitation and therefore the evidence was graded downwards by one level. This quality of evidence was further downgraded on account of serious indirectness of population and comparison as well as imprecision. The evidence from the study conducted in India was also graded downwards for indirectness of population and comparison and imprecision. The overall quality of evidence was regarded to be very low addressing the question of whether ceftriaxone is better than benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin (Table 6).

The possibility of treating severe infections in neonates and young infants outside hospitals was first demonstrated by Bang et al, who documented that home-based newborn care by village-level workers, including treatment of severe infections, with a combination of an oral and an intramuscular antibiotic resulted in substantial reduction in neonatal mortality in a remote area in India. However, the antibiotic regimen used by Bang et alwas shown to be inferior to a combination of intramuscular procaine penicillin and gentamicin in Pakistan. Building upon Bang's work, Baqui et alin Bangladesh documented that community health workers (CHWs) could diagnose and treat presumptive sepsis with intramuscular procaine penicillin and gentamicin. In Nepal, an alternative delivery strategy was successfully tested in which community volunteers identified neonates with severe infection but professionally trained health workers provided antibiotic treatment. At the peripheral health facility, health workers were trained to administer antibiotic injections. To date, only a limited number of countries have adopted these approaches, limiting the potential contribution toward Millennium Development Goal 4 (reduction in child mortality by two-thirds).

Severity of illness varies among infants with infections, and treatment must be tailored to the level of severity. Infants identified as having PSBI based on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness clinical signs include those who are critically ill (eg, unconscious, convulsing, no movement at all), those with clinical severe infection (eg, not feeding well, reduced movement, chest indrawing, fever or hypothermia) and those with relatively mild illness (eg, fast breathing as a single sign). Injectable antibiotic treatment regimens for < 7 days have not been evaluated for infants with clinical severe infection. Oral antibiotics alone have been used for the treatment of pneumonia in neonates, with reduction of pneumonia-specific mortality. However, oral treatment of pneumonia or other severe infections has not been compared with treatment with parenteral antibiotics.

### Discontinuing β-lactam treatment after 3 days for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in non-critical care wards (PTC): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial [^e2bacd1b]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy for patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia should help reduce antibiotic consumption and thus bacterial resistance, adverse events, and related costs. We aimed to assess the need for an additional 5-day course of β-lactam therapy among patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were stable after 3 days of treatment.

Methods

We did this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial (the Pneumonia Short Treatment [PTC]) in 16 centres in France. Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia (defined as patients admitted to a non-critical care unit) and who met prespecified clinical stability criteria after 3 days of treatment with β-lactam therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive β-lactam therapy (oral amoxicillin 1 g plus clavulanate 125 mg three times a day) or matched placebo for 5 extra days. Randomisation was done using a web-based system with permuted blocks with random sizes and stratified by randomisation site and Pneumonia Severity Index score. Participants, clinicians, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was cure 15 days after first antibiotic intake, defined by apyrexia (temperature ≤ 37.8°C), resolution or improvement of respiratory symptoms, and no additional antibiotic treatment for any cause. A non-inferiority margin of 10 percentage points was chosen. The primary outcome was assessed in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any treatment (intention-to-treat [ITT] population) and in all patients who received their assigned treatment (per-protocol population). Safety was assessed in the ITT population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01963442, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Dec 19, 2013, and Feb 1, 2018, 706 patients were assessed for eligibility, and after 3 days of β-lactam treatment, 310 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 157) or β-lactam treatment (n = 153). Seven patients withdrew consent before taking any study drug, five in the placebo group and two in the β-lactam group. In the ITT population, median age was 73.0 years (IQR 57.0–84.0) and 123 (41%) of 303 participants were female. In the ITT analysis, cure at day 15 occurred in 117 (77%) of 152 participants in the placebo group and 102 (68%) of 151 participants in the β-lactam group (between-group difference of 9.42%, 95% CI -0.38 to 20.04), indicating non-inferiority. In the per-protocol analysis, 113 (78%) of 145 participants in the placebo treatment group and 100 (68%) of 146 participants in the β-lactam treatment group were cured at day 15 (difference of 9.44% [95% CI -0.15 to 20.34]), indicating non-inferiority. Incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups (22 [14%] of 152 in the placebo group and 29 [19%] of 151 in the β-lactam group). The most common adverse events were digestive disorders, reported in 17 (11%) of 152 patients in the placebo group and 28 (19%) of 151 patients in the β-lactam group. By day 30, three (2%) patients had died in the placebo group (one due to bacteraemia due to Staphylococcus aureus, one due to cardiogenic shock after acute pulmonary oedema, and one due to heart failure associated with acute renal failure) and two (1%) in the β-lactam group (due to pneumonia recurrence and possible acute pulmonary oedema).

Interpretation

Among patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia who met clinical stability criteria, discontinuing β-lactam treatment after 3 days was non-inferior to 8 days of treatment. These findings could allow substantial reduction of antibiotic consumption.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: most oral treatments… [^1f606910]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION What is the best oral treatment for mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia. BOTTOM LINE Using clarithromycin as the standard, telithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and the quinolones levofloxacin and nemonoxacin produce similar benefits regarding clinical response and mortality. Amoxicillin and penicillin may not work as well. Doxycycline is recommended in some guidelines, but it was not included in this analysis. SYNOPSIS The researchers identified 24 randomized controlled trials of oral treatment for mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia in adults confirmed with imaging by searching two databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, and the reference lists of practice guidelines and review articles. They included all the research written in one of four languages.

Pairs of investigators selected articles for inclusion, abstracted the data, and evaluated the research for risk of bias. Because few studies compared antibiotics directly, the authors used a network meta-analysis to estimate differences in response. No antibiotic produced statistically superior results to clarithromycin. Compared with clarithromycin, clinical response was best with nemonoxacin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin. Nemonoxacin, levofloxacin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate had lower mortality. Penicillin and amoxicillin produced lower clinical response. One-half of the studies were deemed to be at high risk of bias due to breaches in modern conduct of clinical trials. There was no evidence of publication bias, but studies of doxycycline were excluded because they were published too long ago.

### Identifying the best initial oral antibiotics for adults with community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^1f166a62]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare rates of clinical response and mortality for empiric oral antibiotic regimens in adults with mild-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and the reference lists of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. We included randomized trials of adults with radiologically confirmed mild to moderate CAP initially treated orally and reporting clinical cure or mortality. Abstracts and studies were reviewed in parallel for inclusion in the analysis and for data abstraction. We performed separate analyses by antibiotic medications and antibiotic classes and present the results through network diagrams and forest plots sorted by p-scores. We assessed the quality of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias framework, as well as global and local inconsistency.

Results

We identified 24 studies with 9361 patients: six at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk, and 12 at high risk. Nemonoxacin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin were most likely to achieve clinical response (p-score 0.79, 0.71, and 0.69 respectively), while penicillin and amoxicillin were least likely to achieve clinical response. Levofloxacin, nemonoxacin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate were most likely to be associated with lower mortality (p-score 0.85, 0.75, 0.74, and 0.68 respectively). By antibiotic class, quinolones and macrolides were most effective for clinical response (0.71 and 0.70 respectively), with amoxicillin-clavulanate plus macrolides and beta-lactams being less effective (p-score 0.11 and 0.22). Quinolones were most likely to be associated with lower mortality (0.63). All confidence intervals were broad and partially overlapping.

Conclusion

We observed trends toward a better clinical response and lower mortality for quinolones as empiric antibiotics for CAP, but found no conclusive evidence of any antibiotic being clearly more effective than another. More trials are needed to inform guideline recommendations on the most effective antibiotic regimens for outpatients with mild to moderate CAP.

### Randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerability of IV gatifloxacin with the option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin versus IV ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin or clarithromycin) with the option for oral stepdown clarithromycin for treatment of patients with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization [^5df6a098]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires the use of antibiotics with activity against a broad spectrum of respiratory pathogens and suitable pharmacokinetic properties to simplify IV-to-oral step-down therapy switches.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of IV gatifloxacin with the option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin with a standard regimen of IV ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin or clarithromycin) with the option for oral stepdown clarithromycin in patients with mild to moderate CAP requiring hospitalization.

Methods

In a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study, adults with CAP received 7 to 14 days of treatment with either IV gatifloxacin 400 mg QD with the stepdown option or IV ceftriaxone 1 or 2 g QD (with or without erythromycin 0.5 or 1 g QID or clarithromycin 500 mg BID) with the stepdown option.

Results

One hundred seventy adults with CAP were included in the study. IV gatifloxacin was stepped down to oral gatifloxacin in 90.6% (7785) of patients; IV ceftriaxone was stepped down to oral clarithromycin in 87.1% (7485) of patients. Among clinically evaluable patients (n = 153), cure rates at 1 to 3 days after treatment were 97.4% in the gatifloxacin group (7476) and 90.9% in the ceftriaxone group (7077), with a 95% CI for the difference (-3.7% to 19.1%) indicating statistical equivalence. In patients in whom pathogens were isolated from pretreatment sputum cultures, bacteriologic eradication rates were 100.0% (2929) and 90.9% (3033), respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated; treatment-related adverse events occurred in 27.1% (2385) and 21.2% (1885) of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

In the population studied, treatment with IV gatifloxacin with an option for oral stepdown gatifloxacin was as effective for achieving clinical cure as IV ceftriaxone (with or without concomitant IV erythromycin or clarithromycin) with an option for oral stepdown clarithromycin. Both regimens were well tolerated.

### Efficacy of exclusively oral antibiotic therapy in patients hospitalized with nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia: a retrospective study and meta-analysis [^22586fb0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy of oral antibiotics in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to identify factors precluding oral therapy.

Methods

In a meta-analysis, we compared inpatient oral and parenteral therapy in community-acquired pneumonia. Studies were reviewed independently and rated by two reviewers, and results were summarized. We also performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia and compared outcomes in patients treated with oral versus parenteral therapy.

Results

For the meta-analysis, we identified seven studies involving 1366 patients. Study exclusions included severe pneumonia or impaired oral absorption. There was no significant difference in the relative risk of mortality at the end of treatment or at follow-up. Mean length of hospital stay was shorter (6.1 days vs. 7.8 days) in patients taking oral antibiotics than in those taking the parental form. In the retrospective cohort, 18% (124/698) of patients received oral-only therapy; these patients were younger (median age, 75 vs. 78 years, P = 0.01) and had lower mean pneumonia severity index scores (101 vs. 119, P < 0.0001) than those who received parenteral therapy. In multivariable models, oral-only patients had a median length of stay that was 1.3 days shorter (95% CI: 0.4% to 2.2% days; P = 0.008) and a median antibiotic cost that was 56 dollars lower (95% CI: 53 dollars to 58 dollars; P < 0.0001) than that of patients in the parenteral group, but mortality was similar.

Conclusion

Although prospective data are limited, oral antibiotics in certain hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia are effective. More data are needed to identify appropriate candidates for exclusively oral antibiotic therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^6ce845ec]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — community-acquired pneumonia/bacteremia empiric therapy — children with HIV whose immune systems are not seriously compromised and who are not neutropenic should be treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in children with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with only mild or no immunosuppression who are fully immunized can be treated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin) according to the same guidelines as for healthy children (BIII). For hospitalized children outside of the neonatal period with suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia, options for empiric therapy include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), respectively (AIII). The addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be considered for hospitalized individuals with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns and adjusted according to culture results). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug if infection with Pseudomonas spp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised children with HIV and invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Epidemiology and management of pediatric group A streptococcal pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion: an observational study [^79ca28f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Duration of fever post-admission was prolonged (median, 12 days), as previously reported for both GAS and S. pneumoniae PPE, with report in a large cohort of comparatively longer fever and hospital stay for GAS pneumonia, postulated to be due to extensive pleural inflammation. It is possible that continued fever contributed to unnecessary antibiotic escalation in a number of cases, with only 4.3% of children having confirmed bacterial secondary/coinfection; yet, many children receiving multiple antibiotics covering a much broader range of pathogens. The detection of a second bacterial pathogen was lower than had been seen in a retrospective all-cause PPE study of 1447 patients (9.4%).GAS is universally penicillin-sensitive, so children with proven GAS infection would be good candidates for de-escalation to benzylpenicillin (with additional clindamycin to inhibit toxin production in the acute stages); however, in this cohort, children largely remained on a third-generation cephalosporin alongside clindamycin. The advantage of ceftriaxone is its once daily administration for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy, or to reduce nursing workload. Previous guidance on length of IV therapy required is unclear and depends on adequate effusion drainage and the child's clinical response. Minimum suggested total treatment course is 2 weeks (with at least 1 week IV), or up to 6 weeks in complicated infection. Early switch to oral antibiotics may be appropriate, with treatment failure rates comparable, or in one study higher for those on outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy than oral antibiotics, due to complications with vascular access. Stewardship of oral antibiotics could also be improved in this cohort by use of amoxicillin in place of co-amoxiclav (as an appropriate and palatable oral stepdown for GAS) for ongoing therapy.

14.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 7 to 14 day Treatment Regimen

Adult inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were evaluated in 2 pivotal clinical studies. In the first study, 590 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, unblinded randomized trial comparing levofloxacin 500 mg once daily orally or intravenously for 7 to 14 days to ceftriaxone 1 to 2 grams intravenously once or in equally divided doses twice daily followed by cefuroxime axetil 500 mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 to 14 days. Patients assigned to treatment with the control regimen were allowed to receive erythromycin (or doxycycline if intolerant of erythromycin) if an infection due to atypical pathogens was suspected or proven. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed during treatment, 5 to 7 days posttherapy, and 3 to 4 weeks posttherapy. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) with levofloxacin at 5 to 7 days posttherapy, the primary efficacy variable in this study, was superior (95%) to the control group (83%). The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacinminus comparator) was [-6, 19]. In the second study, 264 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, non-comparative trial of 500 mg levofloxacin administered orally or intravenously once daily for 7 to 14 days. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 93%. For both studies, the clinical success rate in patients with atypical pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were 96%, 96%, and 70%, respectively. Microbiologic eradication rates across both studies are presented in Table 10.

Community-Acquired Pneumonia Due to Multi-Drug Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae

Levofloxacin was effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP). MDRSP isolates are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC ≥ 2 mcg/mL), 2ndgeneration cephalosporins (e.g., cefuroxime, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Of 40 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 38 patients (95.0%) achieved clinical and bacteriologic success at post-therapy. The clinical and bacterial success rates are shown in Table 11.

Not all isolates were resistant to all antimicrobial classes tested. Success and eradication rates are summarized in Table 12.
