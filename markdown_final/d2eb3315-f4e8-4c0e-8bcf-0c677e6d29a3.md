## Question

A 41-year-old female with a buffalo bump has been on HRT for 10–15 years following a partial hysterectomy and was seen by rheumatology for a positive ANA. I want to check cortisol levels — should I order free and total?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cortisol tests to order — free, total, or both — when checking cortisol levels in a 41-year-old woman on long-term estrogen-containing HRT with a "buffalo hump". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how estrogen therapy alters cortisol-binding globulin and total versus free cortisol. Then, I should review guideline-endorsed first-line screening tests for Cushing's and their susceptibility to binding-protein confounding. Next, I will examine evidence on the dexamethasone suppression test in patients on estrogens and whether free cortisol post-DST mitigates false positives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based testing plan and explicitly state what not to order in this scenario.

> Let me first confirm when screening is appropriate. A dorsocervical fat pad ("buffalo hump") is a recognized feature of hypercortisolism and, in the right clinical context, justifies screening once exogenous glucocorticoid exposure is excluded; the ANA work-up is orthogonal to cortisol physiology and does not guide test selection for Cushing's syndrome. The Endocrine Society guideline supports screening when there are multiple or progressive features suggestive of Cushing's, not by using a random serum cortisol but with validated first-line tests, a position echoed by recent reviews and primary care guidance [^111xuCgY] [^117EK3tV] [^115H6qjN] [^1167XavQ].

> Now, I need to check the key confounder: estrogen therapy. Estrogen — especially oral formulations — induces hepatic synthesis of cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), which raises measured total serum cortisol without increasing the biologically active free fraction; thus, total cortisol can appear "high" despite normal adrenal output. Hold on, I should verify whether this specifically applies here; the 2024 ESE/Endocrine Society guideline explicitly notes elevated serum total cortisol with high CBG in women on oral estrogens, and physiological studies show that changes in oral estrogen status alter total but not free or salivary measures, reinforcing free cortisol as the accurate index of adrenal activity in this setting [^111r3g3a] [^116NofPg].

> Next, I should review which screening tests are recommended and which to avoid. The Endocrine Society guideline recommends one of three first-line tests: 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC), or the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test; critically, random total serum cortisol is not recommended for screening because of variability and binding-protein confounding, which is exactly the issue with estrogen-induced CBG elevation here. Wait, let me verify that statement; yes, both the original guideline and subsequent summaries emphasize these three options and caution against random total cortisol for initial screening [^111xuCgY] [^117CkvtN] [^1167XavQ].

> I will now examine which tests best avoid CBG interference. UFC directly measures unbound cortisol excretion and is unaffected by CBG, while late-night salivary cortisol reflects plasma free cortisol and is simple and reproducible, maintaining diagnostic accuracy even when binding proteins are altered. Hold on, I should double-check sensitivity and practical considerations: LNSC has high diagnostic performance and is endorsed as a first-line test; UFC measured by LC-MS/MS has excellent accuracy; both should be repeated due to day-to-day variability in cortisol secretion [^114w2RAM] [^111qTAih] [^115Eccu6] [^1167XavQ].

> Wait, what about the dexamethasone suppression test in someone on estrogens? I need to ensure we don't jump to conclusions. Estrogen use is a well-known cause of false-positive DST when interpretation relies on total serum cortisol thresholds, because elevated CBG drives higher total cortisol post-DST despite adequate suppression. Let me verify whether measuring free cortisol post-DST helps; a 2022 study defined free cortisol reference ranges during DST and showed oral contraceptive estrogen was the only factor linked to false positives by total cortisol, whereas post-DST free cortisol improved diagnostic accuracy. So, if DST is used here, concurrent free cortisol (and dexamethasone level) should be measured to avoid misclassification [^116kxSES] [^115ifiVY].

> Next, I should review practical testing details I might miss otherwise. For UFC, at least two 24-hour collections are advised to address biological variability; LC-MS/MS assays enhance specificity and mitigate cross-reactivity. For LNSC, collect between 23:00 and 24:00 on two separate nights, and consider circadian confounders like shift work or sleep disruption, which can blunt the normal late-night nadir. Hmm, wait a minute — do guidelines specify repetition? Yes, both Endocrine Society and contemporary reviews advise repeating UFC and LNSC because of intrapatient variability, and circadian considerations are underscored in guideline discussions of cortisol interpretation [^117CkvtN] [^111qTAih] [^113ZfEHQ] [^111r3g3a] [^1167XavQ].

> Let me reconsider my earlier phrasing about UFC being the "gold standard". That might overstate the hierarchy. The guideline actually presents three equivalent first-line options whose selection should be individualized; while some data suggest excellent performance of UFC by LC-MS/MS, the recommendation is not to prioritize one universally but to choose based on patient factors and logistics. Thanks for catching that — UFC is highly effective, but not uniquely mandated as first-line over LNSC or DST in all patients [^111xuCgY] [^111qTAih] [^1167XavQ].

> Determining the final recommendation, I should confirm each piece aligns. Given long-term estrogen therapy with likely elevated CBG, ordering a serum total cortisol for screening risks a false-positive and should be avoided. Instead, measure free cortisol with either two 24-hour UFCs and/or two late-night salivary cortisol samples; if a DST is pursued, interpret suppression using free cortisol (with adequate dexamethasone level) rather than total cortisol to mitigate estrogen-related false positives. Abnormal or discordant results should be confirmed with an alternative first-line test and prompt endocrinology referral for further evaluation, consistent with guideline pathways. Hold on, I should verify that confirmatory cross-testing is recommended; yes, repeating with a different first-line test is endorsed to confirm an abnormal screen before etiologic work-up [^111xuCgY] [^114EPhue] [^115ifiVY].

For a 41-year-old woman on long-term HRT with a buffalo hump, **screen for Cushing's syndrome** using **late-night salivary cortisol** or **24-hour urinary free cortisol** as first-line tests, because HRT elevates CBG and falsely increases total serum cortisol [^111r3g3a] [^114w2RAM] [^111qTAih]. Total serum cortisol is not recommended for **initial screening** because of estrogen-related binding effects; if used, interpret with caution and consider measuring CBG or free cortisol (equilibrium dialysis or LC-MS/MS). Confirm abnormal results with a different first-line test or a **1-mg dexamethasone suppression test**, and refer to endocrinology for further evaluation [^114EPhue] [^111xuCgY].

---

## Physiological basis of cortisol measurement

Cortisol circulates mostly bound to CBG and albumin, with only the free fraction biologically active; because **CBG increases with estrogen** (including HRT), total cortisol is artificially elevated, increasing false positives if total cortisol is used alone [^111r3g3a].

---

## Impact of hormone replacement therapy on cortisol measurements

HRT — especially oral estrogens — **raises CBG** and total cortisol without changing free cortisol; therefore, total cortisol can misclassify hypercortisolism in women on HRT [^111r3g3a]. This binding effect limits the reliability of total cortisol for screening in this setting.

---

## Recommended initial screening tests for Cushing's syndrome

The Endocrine Society and AAFP recommend one of the following **first-line tests** for suspected Cushing's syndrome [^115H6qjN] [^111qTAih]:

- **Late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC)**: Noninvasive, reflects free cortisol, and is unaffected by CBG; preferred in patients on HRT [^114w2RAM].
- **24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC)**: Measures free cortisol over 24 hours and is not influenced by CBG [^111qTAih].
- **1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST)**: Useful but can be confounded by altered dexamethasone metabolism or absorption; interpret cautiously in HRT users.

Given CBG elevation with HRT, **LNSC or UFC** are preferred for initial screening.

---

## Limitations of total serum cortisol measurement in patients on HRT

Total serum cortisol is **confounded by CBG** and can be falsely elevated in HRT users, reducing specificity and increasing false-positive results [^111r3g3a]. If total cortisol is used, measure CBG or calculate free cortisol (e.g. equilibrium dialysis or LC-MS/MS) to improve accuracy.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **CBG-aware testing** and recommend LNSC or UFC as first-line tests in patients on HRT [^115H6qjN] [^111qTAih]. Abnormal results should be confirmed with a different first-line test or with a 1-mg DST [^114EPhue]. Persistent clinical suspicion despite negative tests warrants referral to endocrinology [^111xuCgY].

---

## Practical approach to cortisol testing in this patient

Given HRT use and clinical features, **the following approach is recommended**:

1. **Initial screening**. Perform LNSC (two separate samples) or UFC (two 24-hour collections) to assess free cortisol.
2. **Confirmation**. If abnormal, confirm with a different first-line test or a 1-mg DST.
3. **Interpretation**. Interpret results in the context of HRT and consider measuring CBG or free cortisol if total cortisol is used.
4. **Referral**. Refer to endocrinology for further evaluation and management if results are abnormal or clinical suspicion remains high.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Test** | **Recommended for initial screening in HRT patients?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Total serum cortisol | No | Confounded by elevated CBG due to HRT |
| Free cortisol (salivary or urinary) | Yes | Reflects biologically active cortisol; unaffected by CBG |
| 1-mg DST | Yes, with caution | Useful but may be confounded by altered dexamethasone metabolism |

---

In a 41-year-old woman on long-term HRT with a buffalo hump, **LNSC or UFC** are the preferred initial screening tests for Cushing's syndrome because they are not affected by estrogen-induced CBG elevation. Total serum cortisol is not recommended for initial screening in this context because of false-positive elevations; if used, interpret with caution and consider measuring CBG or free cortisol.

### Utility of salivary cortisol measurements in Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency [^114w2RAM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

The measurement of cortisol in saliva is a simple, reproducible, and reliable test to evaluate the normal and disordered control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. There are a variety of simple methods to obtain saliva samples without stress, making this a robust test applicable to many different experimental and clinical situations.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid Medline and PubMed from 1950 to present were searched using appropriate strategies. The bibliographies of all relevant citations were evaluated for any additional appropriate citations.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Measurement of an elevated late-night (2300 to 2400 h) salivary cortisol has a greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Late-night salivary cortisol measurements are also useful to monitor patients for remission and/or recurrence after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Because it is a surrogate for plasma free cortisol, the measurement of salivary cortisol may be useful during an ACTH stimulation test in patients with increased plasma binding protein concentrations due to increased estrogen, or decreased plasma binding protein concentrations during critical illness. Most reference laboratories now offer salivary cortisol testing.

- **Conclusions**: It is expected that the use of the measurement of salivary cortisol will continue to be of importance.

### Screening tests for Cushing's syndrome: Urinary free cortisol role measured by LC-MS/MS [^111qTAih]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of initial screening tests for Cushing's syndrome (CS). The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend one of the following tests: the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC), or urinary free cortisol (UFC) measurement. We examined the diagnostic performance of these tests in a series of patients.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 137 patients with clinical conditions suggestive of hypercortisolism: 38 with confirmed CS diagnosis and 99 without (termed non-CS). UFC was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, whereas LNSC was measured by the radioimmunometric method, and serum cortisol was measured by a chemiluminescence immunoassay.

- **Results**: Comparing CS versus non-CS, a cutoff of 138 nmol/L after 1-mg DST revealed the best specificity (97%), whereas the 50-nmol/L cutoff confirmed the best sensitivity (100%). The sensitivity and specificity for LNSC greater than 14.46 nmol/L were 84% and 89%, respectively, whereas for UFC greater than 170 nmol per 24 hours, they were 97% and 91%. Overall, UFC revealed a combined higher positive and a lower negative likelihood ratio among first-line tests (respectively 10.7 and 0.03). A receiver-operating curve contrast analysis was computed to compare the power of each single test with that of the others, alone or combined (DST+LNSC, DST+UFC, and LNSC+UFC) or with that of all the tests together (DST+LNSC+UFC). The UFC assay was at least as good as all the other possible combinations.

- **Conclusions**: Measuring UFC by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be an effective screening test.

When interpreting the values of morning cortisol measurement, it has to be taken into account that several factors can affect the results. Cortisol production is affected by the sleep-awake cycle, with cortisol secretion reaching its peak just minutes before waking up. Thus, morning serum cortisol can appear falsely low in individuals with disrupted circadian rhythm, such as night shift workers, jet lag, and severe insomnia. In addition, serum cortisol concentrations can be elevated in patients with elevated cortisol-binding globulin, as seen during pregnancy and in women on oral estrogens. By contrast, serum cortisol concentrations can be decreased in patients with low albumin and cortisol-binding globulin, as in hypoalbuminemic states such as advanced cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition, and prolonged critical illness.

The interpretation of serum cortisol varies depending on the assays used. Available techniques for measuring serum cortisol, listed from least to most accurate, are immunoassays using polyclonal antibodies, immunoassays using more specific monoclonal antibodies to cortisol, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For example, in a large study of patients undergoing a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, baseline cortisol that excluded adrenal insufficiency varied between 336 (12.2 μg/dL) and 506 nmol/L (18.3 μg/dL) when measured by three different immunoassays. Most prior studies utilized different forms of immunoassays rather than mass spectrometry-based assays. Therefore, it is important to point out that, ideally, physicians should be aware of these variations.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, more specifically with respect to subsequent laboratory testing, the ES 2008 guidelines recommend confirming abnormal results from initial laboratory testing using a different test. This should be drawn from the recommended initial tests, such as urine free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, or a longer low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.

### Septic shock and sepsis: A comparison of total and free plasma cortisol levels [^115LANvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Severe systemic infection leads to hypercortisolism. Reduced cortisol-binding proteins may accentuate the free cortisol elevations seen in systemic infection. Recently, low total cortisol increments after tetracosactrin have been associated with increased mortality and hemodynamic responsiveness to exogenous hydrocortisone in septic shock (SS), a phenomenon termed by some investigators as relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI).

Free plasma cortisol may correspond more closely to illness severity than total cortisol when comparing septic shock (SS) and sepsis (S).

This was a prospective study conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital. Participants included patients with SS (n = 45), S (n = 19), and healthy controls (HCs, n = 10). The aim of the study was to compare total and free cortisol, measured directly and estimated by Coolens' method, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and albumin in patients with SS (with and without RAI) and S during acute illness, recovery, and convalescence.

The results showed that free cortisol levels reflected illness severity more closely than total cortisol when comparing SS, S, and HC subjects. Basal free cortisol levels were SS, 186 nmol/liter; S, 29 nmol/liter; HC, 13 nmol/liter (P < 0.001). Basal total cortisol levels were SS, 880 nmol/liter; S, 417 nmol/liter; HC, 352 nmol/liter (P < 0.001). Stimulated free cortisol increments varied greatly with illness category: SS, 192 nmol/liter; S, 115 nmol/liter; HC, 59 nmol/liter (P = 0.004). In contrast, total cortisol increments did not vary significantly: SS, 474 nmol/liter; S, 576 nmol/liter; HC, 524 nmol/liter (P = 0.013).

### High variability in baseline urinary free cortisol values in patients with Cushing's disease [^114d8uAr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease is caused by the hypersecretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from a corticotroph adenoma, which in turn causes overproduction of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Patients with Cushing's disease have a 5.5-fold higher mortality than the general population and tend to have numerous comorbidities, including central obesity, osteoporosis, systemic arterial hypertension, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hypercortisolism are paramount because a long duration of disease is associated with increasingly severe complications. Effective treatment improves life expectancy in patients with Cushing's disease.

The evaluation of a patient with suspected hypercortisolism is often complex and expensive. The pulsatile nature and circadian variability of ACTH and cortisol secretion in healthy individuals and in patients with Cushing's syndrome mean that random blood ACTH and cortisol sampling are not useful for diagnosis. The Endocrine Society recommends measurement of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), late-night salivary cortisol, or cortisol suppression during a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST), or a 48-hour low-dose DST, for the detection of Cushing's syndrome. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on diagnostic tests for Cushing's syndrome showed that UFC and overnight DST have the most evidence to support their use.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117CkvtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, more specifically regarding initial laboratory testing, the ES 2008 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following tests to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome, based on the suitability for the individual patient:

- **Urinary free cortisol**: A test measuring the amount of cortisol expelled through urine over 24 hours.
- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: A test assessing cortisol levels from a saliva sample collected late at night.
- **1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test**: A test involving a small dose of dexamethasone taken overnight to observe cortisol suppression.
- **Longer low-dose dexamethasone suppression test**: A test that uses a longer low-dose regimen to assess cortisol suppression.

These diagnostic options allow clinicians to tailor testing to the specific needs and conditions of each patient.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1114VVRT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Cushing's syndrome, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a follow-up morning cortisol and/or performing an ACTH stimulation test. This is to assess the recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with at least one intact adrenal gland, assuming there are no contraindications. Discontinue corticosteroid when the response to these tests is normal.

### Continuous free cortisol profiles in healthy men [^112o4MGc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

In humans, approximately 95% of circulating cortisol is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin. It is only the free fraction that is biologically active and can activate signaling pathways via glucocorticoid hormone receptors in cells. Microdialysis is a well-established technique that enables the sampling of molecules in different compartments of the body, including extracellular fluid. This is the first study validating a rapid sampling microdialysis method measuring free cortisol in the subcutaneous and blood compartments of healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: Healthy nonsmoking volunteers (42 men, aged 18–24 years; body mass index 18–25 kg/m²) received placebo (saline), 250 μg Synacthen, or 1 mg dexamethasone with 10-minute sampling to measure total and free cortisol (subcutaneous, intravenous, and saliva) for an hour before and 4 hours after administration.

- **Results**: Following stimulation by Synacthen, total serum cortisol and free cortisol in both compartments rose significantly, achieving and maintaining maximum levels between 2 and 3 hours following the stimulus. A decline in cortisol levels was evident after the administration of dexamethasone or placebo, but there was clear pulsatile activity around lunchtime in the latter group, which was prominent in the blood compartment (total and free cortisol). There was good correlation between serum total and free cortisol (subcutaneous and intravenous) in the Synacthen and dexamethasone groups, with no significant delay (less than 5 minutes) between total and free cortisol.

- **Conclusions**: This seminal study provides insights into cortisol dynamics and validates a novel method for assessing free cortisol in humans.

### Salivary cortisone is a potential biomarker for serum free cortisol [^116NofPg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Salivary cortisol measurement is used as a practical surrogate for serum free cortisol. However, parotid tissue harbors 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD2) activity, converting cortisol to cortisone.

- **Objective**: This study was designed to assess the impact of parotid 11β-HSD2 activity on the measurement of salivary cortisol. Study participants with changes in circulating corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) (± oral contraceptive, functionally CBG null) and controls were studied during adrenal stimulation by ACTH and post-oral and IV hydrocortisone administration. Simultaneous serum and saliva samples were collected for the measurement of total serum cortisol (SerF) by immunoassay, and unbound cortisol and cortisone in serum (FreeF and FreeE) and saliva (SalF and SalE) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

- **Results**: ACTH stimulation increased SerF, FreeF, SalF, and SalE, but not FreeE, in all individuals. SerF significantly decreased after stopping oral contraceptive administration, but FreeF, SalF, and SalE remained unchanged. In the hydrocortisone administration study, individual FreeF and SalE curves were nearly identical, and SalE closely reflected FreeF in all participants, irrespective of CBG changes. The highest correlation in all (n = 537) matched serum-saliva samples was between SalE and FreeF (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001), and there was no evidence of 11β-HSD2 saturation.

### Role of endogenous glucocorticoid metabolism in human acute pancreatitis [^117BMfcP]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

This study aimed to observe how levels of total cortisol, calculated free cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone change during the early course of human acute pancreatitis and to describe how these changes affect the development of pancreatic necrosis.

- **Design and patients**: In a total of 109 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis (74 with edematous pancreatitis, 35 with necrotizing pancreatitis), serial daily blood monitoring of total and free cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosteroid-binding globulin was done after hospital admission, up to day 6 after the onset of pain. Thirty healthy individuals served as controls.

- **Measurements**: Corticosteroid-binding globulin and total cortisol were measured by immunoassays, and free cortisol was calculated according to Coolens et al. The adrenocorticotropic hormone was measured with an enzyme-linked immunoassay.

- **Results**: Initially, highly elevated levels of calculated free cortisol (median, 86.2 ng/mL; quartile ranges, 50.6–106.7 ng/mL) and total cortisol (41.2 µg/dL, 30.4–51.1 µg/dL) and depressed levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (0.2 pg/mL, 0.1–2.0 pg/mL) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (30.6 µg/mL, 24.1–35.5 µg/mL) were observed. Further, daily measurements revealed increasing adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, whereas cortisol levels decreased.

Although an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels is suggested to increase corresponding cortisol levels, cortisol levels decreased during the development of necrotizing acute pancreatitis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1171fF7m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

- **Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: 3–4 weeks or greater
- **Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: Any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

- **Physiologic daily dose equivalent**: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above-mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability.
- **Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy**: Any dose greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above).
- **Short-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks' duration.
- **Long-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks.

### Comparison of total cortisol, free cortisol, and surrogate markers of free cortisol in diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in patients with stable cirrhosis [^11431vtW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Measurements of serum levels of total cortisol can overestimate the prevalence of adrenal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis. This is due to low concentrations of corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin. We used measurements of serum total cortisol and serum free cortisol after the low-dose short Synacthen test (LDSST) to assess adrenal dysfunction.

We studied 79 patients with stable cirrhosis; adrenal dysfunction was defined by peak concentrations of total cortisol ≤ 494 mmol/L and/or peak concentrations of free cortisol ≤ 33 nmol/L after the LDSST. We determined free cortisol index (FCI) scores and calculated free cortisol levels by using Coolens' equation. The Cox regression model was used to assess the relationship between adrenal dysfunction and outcomes such as death or liver transplant.

Based on measurements of total cortisol, 34% of patients had adrenal dysfunction, and based on measurements of free cortisol, 29% had adrenal dysfunction. There was agreement between total cortisol and free cortisol levels in 22% of patients; in 13%, adrenal dysfunction was diagnosed only on the basis of total cortisol and in 6% only on the basis of free cortisol (κ coefficient, 0.56; P < .01). Low concentrations of corticosteroid-binding globulin (21 vs 54 μg/mL, P < .01) led to an overestimation of adrenal dysfunction that was based on measurement of total cortisol. Measurements of calculated free cortisol consistently overestimated free cortisol concentrations, with variations as large as 87% for baseline values and up to 84% after adjustments.

### High variability in baseline urinary free cortisol values in patients with Cushing's disease [^113Q6sKZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite shortcomings, urinary free cortisol (UFC) measurements are often used in medical practice to diagnose Cushing's disease, assess remission after pituitary surgery, evaluate the efficacy of medical treatments, and monitor for recurrence. The reliability and reproducibility of this test are very important. The Endocrine Society recommendations state that at least two 24-hour UFC measurements should be performed for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. It is, however, currently unclear whether two 24-hour collections are sufficient to establish a reasonable estimate of the secretory activity of the underlying pituitary adenoma or whether more than two measurements are required. In addition, the level of intra-individual variability when using this test is not known.

The aim of this study was to use the four baseline UFC measurements taken from each patient in the randomized, double-blind, Phase III study of pasireotide (NCT00434148) to quantify the intrapatient variability of UFC levels in patients with Cushing's disease. In addition, the study aimed to show whether a greater number of UFC measurements leads to greater accuracy of UFC measurement, a more precise estimation of intrapatient variation, and whether UFC levels correlate with the severity of clinical features of hypercortisolism.

### Overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test and 24 h urine free cortisol-accuracy and pitfalls when screening for Cushing's syndrome [^116kxSES]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) is often delayed due to variable clinical features and its rarity. Simple and accurate screening tests are required to enhance screening for hypercortisolism. Both the overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and urinary free cortisol (UFC) demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CS. However, each test has its own distinctive features, making it preferable in specific clinical conditions. This review will discuss the pitfalls for each of those tests.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualized for each patient, and the results should be interpreted within the clinical context with an understanding of the potential pitfalls of the test used. If the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high, an alternative test should be performed. Clinical vigilance is required, and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency, so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally, and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress doses of glucocorticoids during illness only.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012 [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone, and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock, and this rhythm serves as a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression, and insulin resistance. A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations. However, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm, and patients still have increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement.

Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-hour cortisol production rate, administering hydrocortisone twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning. Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated, with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is the lack of an established biomarker for cortisol activity.

In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that understanding the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring the hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice-daily, weight-related dosing regimen, and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm leads to adverse effects.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^117Pi55f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Cushing's syndrome is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production. This tool is particularly useful in distinguishing Cushing's syndrome from other conditions with similar symptoms and from physiological causes of hypercortisolism, as well as exogenous corticosteroid exposure.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the exclusion of physiological causes of hypercortisolism and exogenous corticosteroid exposure, and the presence of certain biochemical abnormalities. These abnormalities include 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels above the upper limit of normal on two or more separate measurements, late-night salivary cortisol levels greater than 145 ng/dL on two or more separate measurements, and serum cortisol levels greater than 1.8 mcg/dL after 1 mg overnight dexamethasone.

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is considered likely if the patient meets the exclusion criteria and has either elevated urinary and salivary cortisol levels, elevated urinary cortisol and serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone, or elevated salivary cortisol and serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone. If these criteria are not met, a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, facilitating early detection and treatment of this condition.

### Salivary cortisol can replace free serum cortisol measurements in patients with septic shock [^114JySDT]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

There is a renewed interest in adrenal function during severe sepsis; most studies have used total serum cortisol levels. However, only free serum cortisol is biologically active. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of salivary cortisol levels as a surrogate for free serum cortisol levels during septic shock.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven patients with septic shock were studied to determine the correlation between total serum cortisol and salivary cortisol to free serum cortisol levels. Thirty-eight patients were included in the salivary to free serum cortisol correlation. Salivary cortisol level was tested by enzyme immunoassay. Serum total cortisol, free cortisol, and cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) levels were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, equilibrium analysis, and radioimmunoassay, respectively.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD age was 56.6 ± 18.5 years, and 57% were women. The APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score median was 26, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II median was 61, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment median was 13. The correlation between salivary and free serum cortisol levels was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63–0.89; P < .0001). The correlation between free serum cortisol and total serum cortisol levels was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78–0.92; P < .0001). The mean ± SD free serum cortisol level was 2.27 ± 1.64 μg/dL. The mean ± SD salivary cortisol level was 2.60 ± 2.69 μg/dL. The mean ± SD total serum cortisol level was 21.56 ± 8.71 μg/dL. The mean ± SD CBG level was 23.54 ± 8.33 mg/dL.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1113v8hg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Cushing's syndrome, more specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, the Endocrine Society's 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining testing for recurrent disease throughout life, except in patients who underwent resection of an adrenal adenoma with a CT density of less than 10 HUs.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^1167XavQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

If a patient is suspected of Cushing syndrome and exogenous glucocorticoid use is excluded, it is recommended to start by performing one of the first-line screening tests. Recommended initial tests include:

- **Overnight 1-mg DST**
- **24-hour UFC**
- **Late-night salivary cortisol test (LNSC)**: The latter two tests should be performed at least twice because of significant day-to-day variations in cortisol production.

The pooled diagnostic accuracy of the various tests is presented in Figure 2. There is no specific order of screening, but the choice for a specific test can be made based on individual patient characteristics (see also caveats in Figure 2). A promising and relatively novel test to detect chronic hypercortisolism is the measurement of cortisol in scalp hair (see "New developments: potential of hair cortisol measurement as diagnostic tool").

### Real world evidence supports waking salivary cortisone as a screening test for adrenal insufficiency [^116TuntV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Worldwide, adults and children are at risk of adrenal insufficiency largely due to infectious diseases and adrenal suppression from the use of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids. Home waking salivary cortisone is an accurate screening test for adrenal insufficiency; it has the potential to reduce costs, and patients prefer it to the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test. We carried out a service evaluation of home waking salivary cortisone in clinical care to identify implementation barriers.

- **Design, patients and measurements**: Service evaluation in a center where 212 patients referred for adrenal insufficiency had a waking salivary cortisone test. Problems encountered during testing were recorded, and patient feedback was collected via focus groups.

- **Results**: Of all patients providing a waking salivary cortisone, 55% had a normal test, 23% showed adrenal suppression, and 22% had an equivocal result requiring a clinical center ACTH stimulation test. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) for the time of the saliva sample was 07:40 (07:00–08:40). The median (IQR) days between collection and (i) delivery to the local laboratory was 1 (0.25–2) day; (ii) reporting by the local laboratory was 13 (11–18) days. Patients considered the test "easy to do" and preferred it over the inpatient ACTH stimulation test. The principal challenge to clinical implementation was the delay in reporting results to clinicians due to delays at the local laboratory.

- **Conclusions**: This service evaluation provides real-world evidence that home waking salivary cortisone is an effective, practical screening test for adrenal insufficiency.

### Interpretation of abnormal dexamethasone suppression test is enhanced with use of synchronous free cortisol assessment [^115ifiVY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Interpretation of the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) may be influenced by dexamethasone absorption, metabolism, and altered cortisol binding. We aimed to determine the normal ranges of free cortisol during DST in participants without adrenal disorders and to identify the population of patients where post-DST free cortisol measurements add value to the diagnostic workup.

The study was designed as a cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary medical center with adult volunteers without adrenal disorders (n = 168; 47 women on oral contraceptive therapy [OCP], 66 women not on OCP, 55 men) and patients undergoing evaluation for hypercortisolism (n = 196; 16 women on OCP). Measurements included post-DST dexamethasone and free cortisol (mass spectrometry), and total cortisol (immunoassay).

- **Main outcome measures**: Reference range for post-DST free cortisol and diagnostic accuracy of post-DST total cortisol.

Adequate dexamethasone concentrations (≥ 0.1 mcg/dL) were seen in 97.6% of volunteers and 96.3% of patients. Only 25.5% of women volunteers on OCP had abnormal post-DST total cortisol levels (> 1.8 mcg/dL). For volunteers, the upper post-DST free cortisol reference range was 48 ng/dL in men and women not on OCP, and 79 ng/dL in women on OCP. When compared with post-DST free cortisol, the diagnostic accuracy of post-DST total cortisol was 87.3% (95% CI, 81.7–91.7); all false-positive results occurred in patients with post-DST cortisol between 1.8 and 5 mcg/dL. OCP use was the only factor associated with false-positive results (21.1% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.02).

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes individuals to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and subsequent impairment of adrenocortical function. This occurs due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically.

Long-acting glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even at physiologic daily dose equivalents, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during tapering. Recovery of the HPA axis is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids.

In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids, which possess a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency, are more likely to facilitate HPA recovery. This is contingent upon avoiding their administration at nighttime, as this can more markedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

To promote recovery of the HPA axis, if treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer required, a transition to shorter-acting formulations, such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate, is recommended. For patients using non-oral glucocorticoids, such as inhaled steroids, where there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids is advisable when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone offer a wider variety of available doses, enabling better management and adjustment of therapy.

Results of the systematic reviews

- **Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints**: At the start of the guideline process, the working group formulated clinical questions regarding the evaluation of adrenal function and treatment of patients after long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid exposure. The clinical questions that formed the basis for the systematic reviews are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 (see section on Supplementary Material).

Eligible articles were required to present data on adult patients (≥ 18 years). Articles presenting data on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency based on biochemical testing were included based on the use of the high-dose (250 μg) short ACTH (1–24)-test (also referred by brand names as Synacthen or cosyntropin test), since these tests are widely used in clinical practice. During this test, 250 μg of synthetic ACTH (ACTH (1–24), or another corticotropic agent) is administered intravenously. To determine adrenal response to synthetic ACTH, serum cortisol levels are measured 30 and 60 minutes after administration. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, peak cortisol levels < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on the assay, are indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Since the population under study was assessed for glucocorticoid insufficiency, the definition of a positive test was based on cut-off values provided in the individual articles. For clinical question I (incidence and predictors of recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency), the number of p

### Midnight salivary cortisol versus urinary free and midnight serum cortisol as screening tests for Cushing's syndrome [^115Eccu6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003).

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) is often a challenge. Recently, the determination of late-night salivary cortisol levels has been reported to be a sensitive and convenient screening test for CS. However, no studies have included a comparison with other screening tests in a setting more closely resembling clinical practice, i.e. few patients with CS to be distinguished from patients with pseudo-Cushing states (PC), including the large population of obese patients. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of midnight salivary cortisol (MSC) measurement with that of midnight serum cortisol (MNC) and urinary free cortisol (UFC) in differentiating 41 patients with CS from 33 with PC, 199 with simple obesity, and 27 healthy normal-weight volunteers. Three patients with CS had MSC levels lower than the cut-off point derived from receiver operator characteristic analysis (9.7 nmol/liter), yielding a sensitivity for this parameter of 92.7%.

In the whole study population, no statistically significant differences in terms of sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and predictive values were observed among tests. In particular, the overall diagnostic accuracy for MSC (93%; 95% confidence interval, 90.1–95.9%) was similar to those of UFC (95.3%; 94.1–96.5%) and MNC (95.7%; 93.4–98%; both P = NS). The diagnostic performance of MSC was superimposable to that of MNC also within the area of overlap in UFC values (≤ 569 nmol/24 h) between CS and PC. In conclusion, MSC measurement can be recommended as a first-line test for CS in both low-risk (simple obesity) and higher-risk (PC) patient populations.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^1143s4p8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

We identified 18 different chief complaints for which patients were transferred to the tertiary center. The three most common reasons were obesity/weight gain (n = 89, 24% of patients), adrenal or pituitary incidentaloma (n = 40, 11%), and hypertension (n = 40, 11%). Half the patients screened for Cushing syndrome (CS) belonged to groups not counted as the priority groups recommended by the 2008 guidelines. CS was diagnosed in 12% of those patients, compared to 39% among those who fall into the screening groups A to C as recommended by the 2008 guidelines.

- **Group A**: Includes patients with unusual features for their age, such as osteoporosis and osteopenia. These were chief complaints in 12 patients, among whom 7 (58%) received a final diagnosis of CS. Hypertension, mostly of new onset, was noted in the consultation recommendations for 40 patients, with CS confirmed in 5 (13%).

- **Group B**: Consists of patients with multiple and progressive features, particularly those more predictive of CS. Eighteen patients presented with multiple symptoms (defined as more than three typical symptoms for CS), with CS diagnosed in 15 (83%). Myopathy was a chief complaint in 14 patients, with CS confirmed in 9 (64%).

### Diagnostic approach to Cushing disease [^111CgZ3Q]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

In Cushing disease, a pituitary corticotroph neoplasm causes secondary adrenal hypercortisolism. This condition is associated with known morbidity and mortality, underscoring the need for an efficient and accurate diagnostic approach. An 11 p.m. salivary cortisol level is a modern, simple initial screening tool for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Confirmation with a 24-hour urinary free cortisol test and/or a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test may subsequently be performed.

Patients with repeatedly equivocal results should be reevaluated after several months or undergo a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test following low-dose dexamethasone suppression to help rule out pseudo-Cushing states. The presence of low morning serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels then distinguishes primary adrenal hypercortisolism from Cushing disease and the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Patients with moderate ACTH levels can undergo CRH stimulation testing to clarify the underlying disease because those with an ACTH-independent disorder have blunted subsequent ACTH levels.

Once ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia is detected, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pituitary gland can be performed to detect a pituitary neoplasm. Normal or equivocal MR imaging results revealing small pituitary lesions should be followed up with inferior petrosal sinus sampling, a highly specific measure for the diagnosis of Cushing disease in experienced hands. If necessary, body imaging may be used in turn to detect sources of ectopic ACTH.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to the confirmation of recovery, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining morning serum cortisol testing if confirmation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery is desired. Recognize that the value of morning serum cortisol is a continuum, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^112dqvex]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The main finding of this study is that the 2008 Endocrine Society guideline recommendations are valid and identified roughly 73% of cases presenting with unusual features for age, multiple and progressive features, and incidentaloma in our prospective series covering 10 years between 2012 and 2021. On the other hand, other chief complaints than those mentioned earlier were present in 27% of patients with Cushing syndrome, which should be considered in clinical practice.

- **Implications for clinical practice**: In our experience, half the patients submitted for screening of Cushing syndrome in our specialized center did not belong to one of the recommended groups for screening. As Cushing syndrome is a severe disease when left untreated or diagnosed late — leading to increased mortality and morbidity — sensitivity of screening should be conceptually high to avoid false-negative results. Although the frequency of Cushing syndrome was low in some categories of the chief complaints, our data do not argue against screening in those instances.

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Psychiatric disorders were a very uncommon reason for patient referrals for screening. This is interesting, as depression or/and other psychiatric disorders are very common in patients with Cushing syndrome, affecting up to 80% of patients. The prevalence of depression is high, but Cushing syndrome seems to be seldom suspected in this group. Future studies are needed to analyze the prevalence of Cushing syndrome in patients with psychiatric disorders.

- **PCOS-like symptoms**: PCOS-like symptoms were a common reason for consultation. In a retrospective study, Brzana et al. showed a high prevalence of former treatment for suspected PCOS in patients with Cushing syndrome.

### Salivary cortisone to estimate cortisol exposure and sampling frequency required based on serum cortisol measurements [^114mJfyv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The sensitivity analysis on the timing of samples indicates that the 8-hourly sampling scheme is relatively insensitive to mistiming by up to 1 hour, either way, for any or all samples. Examining the variation of the mistimed (± 1 hour) three-sample eAUCs against the eAUC on-time across all three cohorts shows a median relative error (RE) of 0% (IQR, −7.3% to 7.6%).

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^117G3tLF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare condition often diagnosed late in the course of the disease, years after the initial symptom onset. The diagnosis and management of CS are challenging due to its characterization by multiple symptoms. Many symptoms, like hypertension, diabetes, weight gain, or osteoporosis, are common among the general population, whereas others, like purple striae, are specific to CS. Patients may present oligosymptomatically, both initially during primary disease manifestation and especially at recurrence. The low incidence of CS and clinical overlap with pseudo-Cushing states, such as metabolic syndrome or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can delay definitive diagnosis and treatment, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.

Studies aim to identify patients with CS at earlier stages within cohorts with a relevant prevalence of the condition. Among patients with diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of CS is low, ranging between 0% and 3% depending on patient selection. The likelihood of hypercortisolism is higher in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes, as indicated by a recent meta-analysis. The prevalence of CS among patients with hypertension is similarly low; however, screening is recommended for young patients with resistant hypertension or concomitant diabetes. Screening for endogenous hypercortisolism in patients with obesity is debated as study results vary significantly.

In specific circumstances related to Cushing's syndrome, particularly for patients with suspected cyclic CS, the ES 2008 guidelines recommend using urinary free cortisol or midnight salivary cortisol instead of performing a dexamethasone suppression test. These are considered the diagnostic tests of choice for patients suspected of having cyclic CS.

### Measurements of serum free cortisol in critically ill patients [^114NPj2V]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Because more than 90 percent of circulating cortisol in human serum is protein-bound, changes in the binding proteins can alter measured serum total cortisol concentrations without influencing free concentrations of this hormone. We investigated the effect of decreased amounts of cortisol-binding proteins on serum total and free cortisol concentrations during critical illness when glucocorticoid secretion is maximally stimulated.

- **Methods**: Base-line serum total cortisol, cosyntropin-stimulated serum total cortisol, aldosterone, and free cortisol concentrations were measured in 66 critically ill patients and 33 healthy volunteers in groups that were similar with regard to sex and age. Of the 66 patients, 36 had hypoproteinemia (albumin concentration, 2.5 g per deciliter or less), and 30 had near-normal serum albumin concentrations (above 2.5 g per deciliter).

- **Results**: Base-line and cosyntropin-stimulated serum total cortisol concentrations were lower in the patients with hypoproteinemia than in those with near-normal serum albumin concentrations (P < 0.001). However, the mean (± SD) base-line serum free cortisol concentrations were similar in the two groups of patients (5.1 ± 4.1 and 5.2 ± 3.5 microg per deciliter [140.7 ± 113.1 and 143.5 ± 96.6 nmol per liter]) and were several times higher than the values in controls (0.6 ± 0.3 microg per deciliter [16.6 ± 8.3 nmol per liter], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Cosyntropin-stimulated serum total cortisol concentrations were subnormal (18.5 microg per deciliter [510.4 nmol per liter] or less) in 14 of the patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, specifically concerning the midnight serum cortisol test, the 2008 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend its use in the following situations:

- **Patients with a high clinical index of suspicion of CS**: But normal urinary free cortisol and dexamethasone suppression testing.

- **Patients with a low clinical index of suspicion of CS**: But abnormal dexamethasone suppression testing and mildly elevated urinary free cortisol.

- **Patients who fail to suppress on dexamethasone testing**: Due to anticonvulsant medication.

### The combination of afternoon and midnight salivary cortisol improves the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^115y1Ymp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is challenging and often fraught with many pitfalls depending on several factors. We compare the diagnostic performance of AM serum cortisol, 24-hour urinary free cortisol, and 0800 h, 1400 h, and 2400 h salivary cortisol curve (SCC) in 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test positive and negative patients.

- **Methods**: Eighty-three subjects performed measurements of SCC by the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method, exploiting the circadian rhythm of cortisol.

- **Results**: The reproducibility and specificity of the test identify patients with hypercortisolism in 95% of cases at midnight. Interestingly, when considering two specific points (1400 h and 2400 h) on the SCC, the success rate rises to 100%.

- **Conclusion**: The evaluation of the 1400 h and 2400 h assays led to detection of the total number of patients with Cushing syndrome. Salivary cortisol curve analysis is a non-invasive diagnostic strategy associated with elevated positive predictive value for hypercortisolism capable of enabling diagnosis. In addition, it can be considered for management of patient outcomes and monitoring of Cushing syndrome pharmacological treatment.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recommend against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy.

- **Rationale**: Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to assessing the HPA axis, thus often eliminating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol levels remain indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to undertake dynamic testing should factor in test availability, feasibility, costs, and regional accessibility. There is no evidence to suggest that one specific test is superior in the context of glucocorticoid treatment. Dynamic testing options include the 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, and less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test evaluates only the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation.

	- In cases of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on the assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Suppression of the HPA axis leads to adrenocortical atrophy with an impaired cortisol response, making test results potentially less reliable in patients on shorter durations of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be linked to significant adverse effects. These tests assess the entire HPA axis, yet head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking.

### Measurement of salivary cortisol concentration in the assessment of adrenal function in critically ill subjects: A surrogate marker of the circulating free cortisol [^112siszN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Baseline and cosyntropin-stimulated serum (total and free) and salivary cortisol concentrations were measured in the early afternoon in 51 critically ill patients and healthy subjects. Patients were stratified according to their serum albumin at the time of testing: those whose serum albumin levels were 2.5 gm/dl or less versus others whose levels were greater than 2.5 gm/dl.

- **Results**: Baseline and cosyntropin-stimulated serum free cortisol levels were similar in the two groups of critically ill patients and were severalfold higher (P < 0.001) than those of healthy subjects. Similarly, baseline and cosyntropin-stimulated salivary cortisol concentrations were equally elevated in the two critically ill patient groups and were severalfold higher (P < 0.001) than those of healthy subjects. Salivary cortisol concentrations correlated well with the measured serum free cortisol levels.

- **Conclusions**: Salivary cortisol measurements are simple to obtain, easy to measure in most laboratories, and provide an indirect yet reliable and practical assessment of the serum free cortisol concentrations during critical illnesses. The concentrations of the two measures of unbound cortisol determined in two different body fluids correlated very well, regardless of the serum protein concentrations. Measurements of salivary cortisol can serve as a surrogate marker for the free cortisol in the circulation.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1149kve6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Studies assessing recovery of HPA axis function through measurement of morning cortisol or low-dose 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test were not formally included in the systematic review (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints"), but reported recovery incidence rates of 17% to 100% within a range of 4 days to 3 years. It is plausible that in studies reporting recovery at re-testing already following a couple of days, initial cortisol levels may have represented adrenal suppression due to remaining circulating long-acting exogenous glucocorticoids rather than true adrenal insufficiency.

- **Clinical sub-question Ia**: Which clinical/biochemical parameters predict recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

	- Both studies included for clinical question I also assessed predictors of recovery of adrenal function. In the study by Baek et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher cortisol increments during the first ACTH (1–24)-test than patients without recovery (219 vs 99 nmol/L (10.3 vs 6.7 μg/dL), OR 1.58 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95% CI 1.02–2.46) when adjusting for confounders, basal cortisol concentration and basal ACTH levels. In the study by Leong et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher ambulatory morning cortisol values in between retesting with ACTH (1–24)-test than patients not recovering (286 vs 186 nmol/L (7.9 vs 3.6 μg/dL), OR 1.02 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95% CI 1.01–1.04). There were no studies assessing clinical parameters predicting HPA axis recovery.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^111grBCK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Referring to additional expert reviews, it should be noted that there are authors who plead for a more expansive screening approach, for example, in patients with diabetes, stating that the prevalence of CS is underrated in this condition. Our data suggest that the prevalence might indeed be higher in those patient groups. Tabarin and Perez, however, argue against systematic screening approaches because of their limited benefit. Approaches in the diagnosis of CS should be within a reasonable economical frame. As known from a US study, patients with CS have significantly higher health care costs, whereas costs decrease substantially after successful surgery. A Canadian cost-of-illness analysis showed similar results. To minimize health care-related costs, it would be beneficial to diagnose patients as early as possible. However, at the time of writing, it is unclear how to offer extended screening approaches that are reasonably economical.

- **Limitations and strengths**: This study has limitations; the most important is its monocentric design. In some health care systems, the referral for consultations might be more selective because of reimbursement policies, which can affect screening outcomes. Further prospective studies could be beneficial to validate our findings in other health care settings. Our data might be valid for the health care system in Germany, but could differ considerably in other countries and health care systems. In addition, we cannot comment on racial disparities.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related factors including co-morbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency, or by the medical context, such as the training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

- **Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation**: Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery. If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations and further signs.

### High variability in baseline urinary free cortisol values in patients with Cushing's disease [^113ZfEHQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The data can also be used to evaluate how many UFC measurements should be collected when evaluating Cushing's disease. In this study, a two-sample 24-hour UFC measurement was found to yield a reasonable estimate of intrapatient variation (95% CI: 44–58%). Narrower confidence intervals, and therefore more precise estimates, were obtained when using three (95% CI: 49–59%) or four (95% CI: 48–56%) UFC measurements. However, practical considerations in clinical practice may prevent the routine collection of four 24-hour UFC samples because patients may find the task inconvenient. The results of this study therefore suggest that in this range of cortisol excess, taking the mean of two samples would provide sufficient information for use in everyday care.

No linear correlation was found in the present study between mUFC levels and the severity of features of hypercortisolism, including fasting glucose, HbA1C, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, β-cell function, BMI, or systolic/diastolic blood pressure. This is perhaps surprising because it might be expected that higher UFC levels would correlate with disease severity and therefore with morbidity levels. Previous studies have shown that higher UFC levels in patients with Cushing's disease are associated with more severe cognitive impairment, the presence of major depression, and the risk of serious infection. It is, however, possible that disease severity is associated with duration rather than the degree of hypercortisolism, and it may also be the case that a linear correlation could not be demonstrated because patients with mild degrees of cortisol excess were included in the study.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1162vUxs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical question III**: What is the diagnostic accuracy of a morning cortisol value vs. 250 μg ACTH (1–24) test in diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

Three studies were included. The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S8 (see section on Supplementary material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value vs. a 250 μg ACTH (1–24) test. Of note, in the studies of Sagar et al. and Sbardella et al, ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay.

Sagar et al. found that 100% of patients with morning cortisol 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) passed the ACTH (1–24) test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for ACTH (1–24)-testing in included studies).

The results of the study by Sbardella et al. showed that morning cortisol ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24) test, and morning cortisol ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported.

Debono et al. found that a baseline serum cortisol > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% [data retrieved after contacting the authors].

### Gender determines serum free cortisol: Higher levels in men [^113Y6jcQ]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Because only the free fraction of serum cortisol can readily access glucocorticoid receptors, we investigated whether a gender-related difference in serum free cortisol (FC) exists in the basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated states.

- **Methods**: Serum total cortisol (TC) and FC were measured in 323 subjects (175 men; 148 women). Additionally, the low-dose 1-μg ACTH test was performed in 56 subjects (30 women, 26 men). Subjects were healthy volunteers, recruited in a preventive medicine screening program and an outpatient clinic.

- **Results**: Overall, basal serum TC and FC levels were approximately 18% and 33%, respectively, higher in men than in women (TC: 14.5 ± 0.33 μg/dL vs. 12.3 ± 0.33 μg/dL; p < 0.0001; FC: 0.68 ± 0.02 μg/dL vs. 0.51 ± 0.02 μg/dL; p < 0.0001). The higher FC in men relative to women was apparent across a wide age range (17 to 86 years) and persisted after adjustment for age and body mass index. The FC fraction (%FC, out of TC) was concordantly higher in men (5.4 ± 0.09% vs. 4.8 ± 0.3%; p = 0.046). FC was not related to the estimated menopausal status (women age below and above 47, 50, or 53 years). ACTH-stimulated FC levels were significantly higher in men compared to women, as reflected by the area under the response curve (49.4 ± 3.4 μg × min vs. 39.6 ± 2.2 μg × min; p = 0.0014).

- **Conclusion**: Gender is an unrecognized determinant of serum FC in humans. The possibility of lifelong exposure to the higher bioactive fraction of cortisol under basal conditions or daily stress involving ACTH stimulation should be further investigated.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^115fgC9K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Cushing syndrome results from supraphysiological exposure to glucocorticoids and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis includes the administration of corticosteroids (exogenous Cushing syndrome) or autonomous cortisol overproduction, whether or not ACTH-dependent (endogenous Cushing syndrome). An early diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is warranted; however, in clinical practice, it is very challenging partly because of its resemblance to other common conditions, such as pseudo-Cushing syndrome.

Initial workup should start with excluding local and systemic corticosteroid use. First-line screening tests, including the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion, and late-night salivary cortisol measurement, should be performed to screen for endogenous Cushing syndrome. Scalp-hair cortisol/cortisone analysis helps in the assessment of long-term glucocorticoid exposure as well as in the detection of transient periods of hypercortisolism, as observed in cyclical Cushing syndrome. Interpretation of results can be difficult because of individual patient characteristics and hence requires awareness of test limitations.

Once endogenous Cushing syndrome is established, the measurement of plasma ACTH concentrations differentiates between ACTH-dependent (80%-85%) or ACTH-independent (15%-20%) causes. Further assessment using different imaging modalities and dynamic biochemical testing, including bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling, helps further pinpoint the cause of Cushing's syndrome.

### Clinical and biochemical factors to predict biochemical adrenal insufficiency in hospitalized patients with indeterminate cortisol levels: a retrospective study [^113YcB2c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a lethal condition in which the adrenal cortex cannot produce sufficient glucocorticoids to support the cellular functions and stress response of the human body. Due to its fatal nature, this disease requires early diagnosis and immediate treatment. Multiple tests have been proposed to diagnose AI. Serum morning cortisol at 8 AM is an easy and commonly performed measure to screen for AI. If serum cortisol at 0800 h measures 15–18 μg/dL, normal adrenal function may be predicted and AI can be ruled out.

When the 0800 h cortisol falls into an indeterminate level and AI is strongly suspected, dynamic tests will need to be employed. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is a dynamic test that is usually conducted in clinical practice due to its safety, high reliability, and accuracy. This procedure requires measurement of serum cortisol at 30 and 60 minutes after ACTH is administered at either a low dose (1–5 μg) or a high dose (250 μg). If the peak serum cortisol level after 30 or 60 minutes is < 18–20 μg/dL, the diagnosis of AI is established.

However, in some institutions, the ACTH stimulation test cannot be conducted due to the shortage of ACTH resources and/or lack of specialists, resulting in diagnostic difficulty. Recent studies have proposed novel cut-off levels for serum cortisol that could reduce the number of unnecessary ACTH stimulation tests. Most of these studies were conducted in the outpatient department. Currently, there is only one study that has proposed a proper investigation in this context.

### Assessing adrenal insufficiency of corticosteroid secretion using free versus total cortisol levels in critical illness [^115p613s]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To study the value of free versus total cortisol levels in assessing relative adrenal insufficiency during critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, a prospective study was conducted in a mixed intensive care unit from 2004 to 2007. We consecutively included 49 septic and 63 non-septic patients with treatment-insensitive hypotension, in whom an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test (250 μg) was performed. Serum total and free cortisol (equilibrium dialysis), corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and albumin were assessed.

- **Results**: Although a low CBG resulted in a high free cortisol level relative to total cortisol, free and total cortisol and their increases were well correlated (r = 0.77–0.79, P < 0.001). In sepsis, hypoalbuminemia did not affect total and free cortisol, and increases in total cortisol upon ACTH predicted increases in free cortisol regardless of low binding proteins. In non-sepsis, total cortisol was lower with than without hypoalbuminemia; free cortisol did not differ because hypoalbuminemia concurred with a low CBG. Increases in total cortisol depended less on binding proteins than on raw levels. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting increases in free from total cortisol were 0.93–0.97 in sepsis and 0.79–0.85 in non-sepsis (P = 0.044 or lower for sepsis vs. non-sepsis).

- **Conclusions**: Although the biologically active free cortisol fraction depends on binding proteins, total cortisol correlates to free cortisol in treatment-insensitive hypotension during critical illness. In sepsis, albumin is not an influential factor.

### Plasma, salivary and urinary cortisol levels following physiological and stress doses of hydrocortisone in normal volunteers [^1157R9jn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

We confirm that a morning dose of hydrocortisone 20 mg is supraphysiological and excessive for routine maintenance, resulting in very high free cortisol concentrations that lead to increased urinary cortisol excretion. The measurement of plasma, salivary, or urinary cortisol 2 hours after an oral dose provides a good indication of peak cortisol concentrations. However, further research is necessary to define optimal targets for salivary cortisol and urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio following true physiological hydrocortisone replacement before recommending these measures in clinical practice. An intravenous bolus of hydrocortisone 50 mg achieves very high cortisol levels within 30 minutes of administration. Routine biochemical monitoring of stress glucocorticoid supplementation therapy is not recommended, but measuring trough levels at 5–6 hours may identify a minority of patients who require more frequent intravenous dosing.

### Cushing's syndrome: Rapid evidence review [^115H6qjN]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

With regard to diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning initial laboratory testing, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following tests for screening for hypercortisolism:

- **24-hour urinary free cortisol**: This test measures the amount of cortisol excreted in the urine over a 24-hour period.
- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: This test checks cortisol levels in saliva late at night, which should normally be low.
- **1-mg dexamethasone suppression tests**: This test assesses how corticosteroid hormones affect cortisol production by the adrenal glands.

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function after inhaled corticosteroids: Unreliability of urinary free cortisol estimation [^112meiZa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Free cortisol in the urine (UFC) is frequently measured in clinical research to assess whether inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) cause suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thirteen healthy male subjects received single inhaled doses (of molar equivalence) of fluticasone propionate (FP), triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), budesonide (BUD), and placebo in this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study. UFC output was measured using four commercial immunoassays in samples collected in 12-hour aliquots over 24 hours. The cortisol production rate was assessed from the outputs of cortisol metabolites.

UFC showed a 100% increase over placebo levels in the Abbott TDX assay after the administration of BUD. The other assays detected variable suppression, ranging from 29–61% suppression for FP, 30–62% suppression for TAA, and 25% suppression to 100% stimulation for BUD. Suppression was more pronounced in the first 12 hours after TAA and in the second 12 hours after FP. Similar suppression was found in each 12-hour period after BUD. UFC estimation based on immunoassays after ICS may be an unreliable surrogate marker of adrenal suppression. Many of the published studies describing or comparing the safety of different ICS should be reevaluated, and some should be interpreted with caution.

### Free cortisol and free 21-deoxycortisol in the clinical evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^112GZGTd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with classic CAH and controls have similar free morning cortisol concentrations. In the morning samples (T0), the median total cortisol concentration in patients with untreated classic CAH was 106 nmol/L, which was significantly lower than in patients with NCCAH (249 nmol/L, P = 0.010) and controls (202 nmol/L, P = 0.016) (see Fig. 1A).

- **Steroid concentration (nmol/L) at T0**: In patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), adrenal insufficiency but not CAH (AI), and controls (C).
	- **(A) Morning (8:00–11:00) concentrations of total cortisol**.
	- **(B) Morning concentrations of free cortisol**.
	- **(C) Total 21DF concentrations**.
	- **(D) Free 21DF concentrations**. n.s. nonsignificant, ✱ p ≤ .05, ✱✱ p ≤ .01, ✱✱✱ p ≤ .001. † Excluded from statistical analysis.

Interestingly, the median free morning cortisol concentration in patients with untreated classic CAH (8.62 nmol/L) was not significantly different from patients with NCCAH (9.84 nmol/L, P = 0.313) and controls (6.94 nmol/L, P = 0.573) (see Fig. 1B). In contrast to the total cortisol concentrations, this suggested a comparable cortisol availability.

Patients with untreated classic CAH had a higher percentage of free cortisol (7.5%) than patients with NCCAH (5.5%, P = 0.016), patients with AI (2.1%), and controls (3.3%, P < 0.001) (see Fig. S2A). This indicated that patients with classic CAH had a higher free cortisol concentration than expected based on their total cortisol concentration.

### What is the best approach to suspected cyclical Cushing syndrome? Strategies for managing Cushing's syndrome with variable laboratory data [^115UwS2F]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Cyclical Cushing's syndrome is characterized by a pattern of hypercortisolism in which the biochemistry of cortisol production fluctuates rhythmically. This syndrome is often associated with varying symptoms and signs and is being increasingly recognized. The phenomenon is significant because, if not identified, it can lead to errors in diagnosis, differential diagnosis of the syndrome, and assessment of therapeutic outcomes. The techniques, criteria, protocols, and dynamic biochemical tools used to detect cycling in patients with hypercortisolism are discussed, as well as strategies for diagnosing and managing this important subgroup of patients with hypercortisolism.
