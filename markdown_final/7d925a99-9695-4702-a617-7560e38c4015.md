## Question

for knee injuries in a 28 year old female, is MRI with and without contrast recommended

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MRI with and without contrast is recommended for a 28-year-old female with an acute knee injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about guideline-directed initial imaging after acute knee trauma. Then, I should verify what the standard knee MRI protocol entails for acute internal derangement. Next, I will evaluate whether gadolinium contrast adds diagnostic value in this acute trauma context. After that, I should apply any patient-specific considerations for a healthy 28-year-old woman. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions where contrast might be indicated, even if not in this case.

> Let me first confirm the appropriate first step after acute knee trauma, because I need to ensure we follow evidence-based sequencing of imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria indicate that plain radiographs are the initial imaging modality for acute knee trauma, with decision support based on clinical findings such as focal tenderness, effusion, or inability to bear weight, before advancing to MRI when indicated [^116P9un4] [^1169T2kQ].

> Next, I should review the role of MRI after negative or indeterminate radiographs when internal derangement or occult fracture is suspected. Wait, let me verify the guideline phrasing: for suspected occult fracture or internal derangement following acute twisting trauma with negative radiographs, ACR recommends MRI of the knee as the next imaging modality, and this recommendation pertains to MRI without routine mention of contrast in the acute trauma algorithm [^114Yt4JW].

> I will now examine the standard MRI protocol elements, because I need to ensure the technical approach matches best practice for acute trauma. The ESSR recommendations emphasize a knee MRI protocol comprising T1-weighted and fluid-sensitive T2/PD sequences obtained in three orthogonal planes — sagittal, coronal, and axial — to systematically evaluate menisci, cruciate and collateral ligaments, tendons, cartilage, bone marrow, and periarticular soft tissues in both acute and chronic presentations [^113L6FyY] [^112Su2xj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy without data. I should confirm how well non-contrast MRI performs for common acute injuries. A meta-analysis shows MRI has high diagnostic performance for ACL and meniscal tears, with pooled sensitivity and specificity approximately 87–89% and 88–95%, respectively, supporting the sufficiency of a non-contrast protocol for acute internal derangement evaluation [^115ijErj]. Hmm, wait a minute, for fresh traumatic chondral lesions sensitivity can be lower on routine protocols at lower field strengths, which argues for meticulous fluid-sensitive and high-quality acquisition rather than routine contrast use [^116QfYup].

> Now, I need to assess whether gadolinium contrast adds value in the acute traumatic setting. Let me think about this carefully: contrast is primarily used to characterize synovitis or enhance postoperative or infectious processes, and evidence in inflammatory conditions such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis suggests that with modern PD-weighted sequences at 3T, unenhanced imaging can perform comparably for activity scoring, questioning routine contrast even in that context, while this is not directly applicable to acute trauma evaluation [^1132NCPD] [^114WspaJ]. For cartilage biochemical assessment, techniques like dGEMRIC are research-oriented or for longitudinal cartilage quality assessment, not for initial acute injury workup [^1124b41n]. I should double-check guidelines again — there are no acute trauma recommendations endorsing routine contrast use in suspected ACL, meniscal, or occult fracture scenarios, reinforcing that standard non-contrast MRI is appropriate here [^112X1PFP] [^113L6FyY].

> But wait, what if I am overstating the demographic advantage of MRI in this age group. Earlier I thought this 28-year-old falls within an "optimal age range (18–45 years) where MRI provides the highest diagnostic yield" based on the randomized trial, but hold on, I should verify what that trial actually measured. The RCT in general practice demonstrated that early MRI access for traumatic knee complaints in adults 18–45 years was non-inferior to usual care for functional outcomes over one year; it did not establish a superior diagnostic yield or define an "optimal age range", so I should not overstate that claim and will correct it now [^116MDNE2].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors next, to ensure there is no hidden reason to use contrast. At 28 years, the physes are closed and there are no pediatric-specific protocol modifications needed; sex does not alter the standard acute trauma protocol, and the scenario is distinct from pediatric ACL considerations where diagnostic properties and growth plate issues complicate interpretation, which still would not mandate contrast for acute injury evaluation [^112X1PFP].

> I should also review how MRI results influence management, because overuse is a concern. In younger patients without advanced osteoarthritis, MRI often clarifies internal derangement and can direct surgical referral or targeted rehabilitation, while consensus statements note MRI has a higher negative predictive value than positive predictive value for ACL and meniscal pathology, meaning a negative study is particularly useful to rule out significant intra-articular injury in decision-making after acute trauma [^112PjUhP]. Hold on, I should verify appropriateness concerns too: studies emphasize reducing inappropriate MRI in non-traumatic, degenerative contexts; by contrast, acute trauma with persistent suspicion after radiographs is a scenario where MRI is usually appropriate and impactful, aligning with the current case [^111Psxeu] [^114jJWYt].

> Bringing this together, I should clearly state the recommended approach. First, obtain knee radiographs in the acute setting as per ACR guidance. If radiographs are negative or equivocal and clinical suspicion for internal derangement persists, proceed to non-contrast knee MRI using T1-weighted and fluid-sensitive T2/PD sequences in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. Do not order routine gadolinium contrast for acute traumatic knee evaluation in this 28-year-old, as it does not improve detection of ACL, meniscal, bone marrow, or most osteochondral injuries in the acute workup, and is reserved for specific non-traumatic indications or research protocols such as dGEMRIC, which do not apply here [^116P9un4] [^114Yt4JW] [^113L6FyY] [^1124b41n].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note exceptions where contrast could be considered, even if not applicable here. Contrast may be used when evaluating suspected inflammatory synovitis, postoperative complications including infection or arthrofibrosis, or in specialized cartilage mapping protocols; none of these are part of routine acute trauma assessment in a 28-year-old with a new injury and no prior surgery, so they do not change today's recommendation for non-contrast MRI after appropriate radiographs if clinically indicated [^1132NCPD] [^114WspaJ] [^113L6FyY].

MRI with contrast is **not routinely recommended** for knee injuries in a 28-year-old female. Non-contrast MRI is **standard** [^112Su2xj] for most ligament, meniscal, and cartilage injuries due to its high diagnostic accuracy [^115ijErj] and lower risk profile. Contrast is **reserved** for suspected infection, tumor, or postoperative complications when additional detail is needed. Routine contrast use increases cost, time, and risk without improving diagnostic yield in typical knee injuries.

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of MRI without contrast

MRI without contrast is **highly accurate** for common knee injuries [^115ijErj] [^115a728T]; these metrics support non-contrast MRI as the **preferred initial imaging** [^112X1PFP] for acute meniscal tears and internal derangement:

- **ACL tears**: Sensitivity 87%, specificity 93% [^115ijErj].
- **Medial meniscal tears**: Sensitivity 89%, specificity 88% [^115ijErj] [^111AtjRx].
- **Lateral meniscal tears**: Sensitivity 78%, specificity 95% [^115ijErj].

---

## Indications for MRI with contrast

Contrast-enhanced MRI is **reserved for specific scenarios**; routine contrast use in typical knee injuries is **not supported by current guidelines**:

- **Suspected infection or tumor**: When enhanced tissue characterization is needed.
- **Postoperative evaluation**: To assess complications such as synovitis or graft issues [^113cxKXv].
- **Complex cases**: When non-contrast MRI is inconclusive and further detail is required.

---

## Risks and disadvantages of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI carries **additional risks and disadvantages**:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible with gadolinium-based agents.
- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis**: Rare in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Increased cost and time**: Additional resources and patient time required.
- **Patient discomfort**: Intravenous injection may cause anxiety or discomfort.

### Does MRI add value in general practice for patients with traumatic knee complaints? A 1-year randomised controlled trial [^116MDNE2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To determine whether referral to MRI by the general practitioner (GP) is non-inferior to usual care (no access to MRI by GPs) in patients with traumatic knee complaints regarding knee-related daily function, a multicentre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up was conducted. GPs invited eligible patients during or after their consultation. Eligible patients, aged 18–45 years, consulted a GP with knee complaints due to trauma during the previous 6 months.

Patients allocated to the MRI group received an MRI at a median of 7 days (IQR 1–33) after the baseline questionnaire. Patients in the usual care group received information on the course of knee complaints and a referral to a physiotherapist or orthopedic surgeon when indicated. The primary outcome measure was knee-related daily function, assessed using the Lysholm scale (0 to 100; 100 = excellent function) over 1 year, with a non-inferiority margin of 6 points.

A total of 356 patients were included and randomized to MRI (n = 179) or usual care (n = 177) from November 2012 to December 2015. MRI was non-inferior to usual care concerning knee-related daily function during the 1-year follow-up, for both the intention-to-treat (overall adjusted estimate: 0.33; 95% CI -1.73 to 2.39) and per-protocol (overall adjusted estimate: 0.06; 95% CI -2.08 to 2.19) analyses. There were no differences between both groups in the number of patients visiting other healthcare providers.

In conclusion, MRI in general practice for patients with traumatic knee complaints was non-inferior to usual care regarding knee-related daily function over a one-year period.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^113L6FyY]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is commonly performed. The recommended MRI protocol includes both T1-weighted and fluid-sensitive images in three orthogonal imaging planes. It is essential to correlate clinical findings with MRI findings. However, all structures, including menisci, tendons and ligaments, bones, and soft tissues, should be evaluated.

- **Terminology usage**: It is important to use correct terminology, such as "partial- and full-thickness tear" when reporting ligament pathology, meniscal tears and lesions, and regarding osteochondral defects.

- **Underreported pathology**: Be aware of which pathologies are usually underreported on MRI.

### Spectrum of injuries associated with paediatric ACL tears: An MRI pictorial review [^115Crcxe]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are well known, but most published reviews show obvious examples of associated injuries and give little focus to paediatric patients. Here, we demonstrate the spectrum of MRI appearances at common sites of associated injury in adolescents with ACL tears, emphasising age-specific issues.

- **Methods**: Pictorial review using images from children with surgically confirmed ACL tears after athletic injury.

- **Results**: ACL injury usually occurs with axial rotation in the valgus near full extension. The MRI findings can be obvious and important to management, such as ACL rupture, or subtle but clinically important, such as lateral meniscus posterior attachment avulsion. They may also be obvious and unimportant to management, like femoral condyle impaction injury, or subtle and possibly important, like a medial meniscocapsular junction tear. Paediatric-specific issues of note include tibial spine avulsion, normal difficulty visualising a thin ACL and posterolateral corner structures, and differentiation between incompletely closed physis and impaction fracture.

- **Conclusion**: ACL tear is only the most obvious sign of a complex injury involving multiple structures. Awareness of the spectrum of secondary findings illustrated here and the features distinguishing them from normal variation can aid in accurate assessment of ACL tears and related injuries, enabling effective treatment planning and assessment of prognosis.

- **Teaching points**:
	- The ACL in children normally appears thin or attenuated, while thickening and oedema suggest a tear.

### Every second retired elite female football player has MRI evidence of knee osteoarthritis before age 50 years: a cross-sectional study of clinical and MRI outcomes [^113Mp7z7]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

To assess knee health in retired female football players, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and self-report were utilized. The focus of analysis included degenerative changes of the tibiofemoral joint and their relationship to osteoarthritis symptoms and previous knee injury.

Forty-nine retired elite female football players (98 knees), with an average age of 37 years, participated. The tibiofemoral cartilage and meniscus status of both knees were evaluated using MRI and graded according to modified Outerbridge and Stoller classifications, respectively. Symptoms were assessed through a standardized questionnaire (Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score: KOOS). A semi-structured interview was conducted to record knee injury history. Binary logistic regression models were used to investigate how injury variables relate to outcomes and were reported with odds ratios (OR).

Fifty-one percent of players (n = 25) fulfilled the MRI criterion for knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, 69.4% (n = 34) had substantial meniscal loss, and 59.6% (n = 28) reported substantial clinical symptoms. Chondral and meniscal loss were associated with significantly lower scores on three of five KOOS subscales (p < 0.05). Both chondral and meniscal loss were significantly predicted by previous traumatic knee injury (OR = 4.6, OR = 2.6) and injury affecting the non-striking leg (OR = 8.6, OR = 10.6). Type of injury was also significant; participants with combined ACL/meniscus injuries were at the highest risk for substantial chondral and meniscal loss (OR = 14.8, OR = 9.5). Chondral loss was significantly predicted by isolated meniscus injury treated with partial meniscectomy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is a widely used study that accurately depicts internal derangement. However, the relevance of the findings on knee MRI to the patient's symptoms and clinical course may often be uncertain. This article discusses the clinical significance and natural history of several common findings on knee MRI examinations.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation-a systematic review [^117JmatY]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The risk for misclassification: The studies were deemed too heterogeneous in terms of MRI protocols, grading systems, and population; therefore, a meta-analysis was not performed (Table 1 and Supplement 4). Even within studies using the same grading system, the population and MRI protocols were considered too diverse to allow a meta-analysis. Thus, we present the results from each study individually.

The results are presented separately for males and females. We present the results for the most relevant classification stages for age determination, where individuals both over and under 18 years are represented (Table 2).

Of the 13 studies, four presented data as stage per age and no recalculations had to be performed. For the remaining nine studies, recalculations were performed for six of them. Two studies could not be included in the analysis since they lacked information about minimum and maximum age, which is required for recalculations, and one study had only sufficient information for six participants.

### Physician provider type influences utilization and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee [^114mYbfn]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee is expensive and is neither needed nor useful for all patients presenting with knee pain. Our objective was to determine the completeness of evaluation prior to ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the knee, correlated to the ordering providers' postgraduate medical training and the rate of positive findings on the subsequent magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Methods**: Six hundred consecutive knee magnetic resonance images were reviewed, including 200 consecutive knee magnetic resonance imaging examinations from each of three provider types: orthopaedic surgeons, non-surgical physicians with sports medicine training, and primary care providers. Positive findings on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded as well as a history of present illness, a physical examination, and radiographs made prior to ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. Patient and injury factors were recorded. Differences in patient factors, evaluation before magnetic resonance imaging, and positive findings were examined. A modified Poisson regression approach was used to determine predictors of a proper evaluation before magnetic resonance imaging and positive findings on knee magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Results**: Orthopaedists and non-surgical sports physicians were significantly more likely to document a physical examination, to evaluate radiographs made prior to ordering a magnetic resonance image, and to identify positive findings on the magnetic resonance image (all p < 0.001). In multivariate models, orthopaedists were more likely to document.

### Imaging following acute knee trauma [^113iYoMK]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Joint injury has been recognized as a potent risk factor for the onset of osteoarthritis. The vast majority of studies using imaging technology for longitudinal assessment of patients following joint injury have focused on the injured knee joint, specifically in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury and meniscus tears where a high risk for rapid onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis is well known. Although there are many imaging modalities under constant development, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most important instrument for longitudinal monitoring after joint injury. MR imaging is sensitive for detecting early cartilage degeneration and can evaluate other joint structures including the menisci, bone marrow, tendons, and ligaments which can be sources of pain following acute injury.

In this review, focusing on imaging following acute knee trauma, several studies were identified with promising short-term results of osseous and soft tissue changes after joint injury. However, studies connecting these promising short-term results to the development of osteoarthritis were limited, which is likely due to the long follow-up periods needed to document the radiographic and clinical onset of the disease. Thus, it is recommended that additional high-quality longitudinal studies with extended follow-up periods be performed to further investigate the long-term consequences of the early osseous and soft tissue changes identified on MR imaging after acute knee trauma.

### 2018 international Olympic Committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^112PjUhP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement properties for clinical examination and MRI indicate that no single question, test, or image can accurately identify an ACL injury every time. Although the measurement tools available to clinicians are not perfect, they provide valuable information in a clinical context. Understanding the measurement properties of clinical tools helps clinicians balance information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values. This means that if the clinical examination or MRI are negative for injury, the likelihood of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably confirm the diagnosis.

- **Diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and MRI in intraarticular knee disorders**: Clinical examination involves taking patient history, performing a physical examination, and utilizing X-rays. These tasks were performed by either a paediatric orthopaedic sports medicine specialist or a post-residency paediatric sports medicine fellow.

### Visualization of concurrent anterolateral and anterior cruciate ligament injury on magnetic resonance imaging [^112MpCzQ]. Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability to visualize the anterolateral ligament (ALL) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and identify ALL injuries in both an intact-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and torn-ACL cohort. Additionally, we aimed to assess inter-rater reliability between two radiologists regarding the aforementioned assessment.

- **Methods**: MRIs that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were placed into a control (ACL-intact) or study (ACL-injured) cohort. Two radiologists independently analyzed the MRIs for data points related to demographics, ALL visualization, the presence of ALL injury, and concomitant knee abnormalities. Inter-rater reliabilities for visualizing the ALL and identifying ALL injuries were assessed.

- **Results**: The control and study groups consisted of 116 and 82 MRIs, respectively. Age varied between the two groups, but sex distribution was similar. With near-perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92), both radiologists visualized at least part of the ALL in more than 95% of MRIs irrespective of ACL integrity. The mean incidence of ALL injury in the ACL-injured group was 53.05%, with minimal inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.38). Segond fractures were noted in a mean of 13.95% of MRIs with concomitant ALL and ACL injuries.

- **Conclusions**: The ALL was reliably visualized on MRI, irrespective of whether the ACL was intact or torn. However, ALL injuries were not reliably diagnosed on MRI in the setting of an ACL tear. Poor interobserver reliability indicates the potential for false-positive and false-negative interpretation. These findings suggest that, in this study, ALL injuries could not be consistently identified.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^116JpFFR]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the association of MRI markers with knee symptoms in a general population of young to middle-aged adults. Our results indicate that knee MRI-assessed semiquantitative markers, such as BMLs and cartilage defects, are positively associated with knee symptoms cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 6–9 years. Morphological markers, such as total cartilage volume (particularly patellar), are weakly and negatively associated with knee symptoms in both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. Similarly, total bone area was negatively associated with knee symptoms in both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. Thus, our results suggest that semiquantitative and quantitative measures from knee MRI can possibly be used as a marker of early knee OA in young adults.

Understanding the association between early knee joint structural changes and knee symptoms is of utmost importance in defining early OA. Although radiography is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of knee OA, the concept of early knee OA has dramatically changed with new imaging techniques such as MRI. MRI enables early detection of cartilage defects, changes in cartilage volume and thickness, BMLs, synovitis, and meniscal tears.

Several studies investigating the association of BMLs with knee symptoms in patients with knee OA have reported a significant positive association. Consistent with our previous study, we found a significant association between BMLs and knee symptoms, and a trend towards a dose–response relationship between BMLs and knee pain.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^112Su2xj]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Key recommendations**:

- **The knee examination**: The knee should be examined with images in sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes to ensure that crucial pathological findings are not missed or misinterpreted (Level of evidence: moderate).

- **Imaging protocol requirements**: The general protocol must yield both T2- and T1-weighted images. T1-weighted images are used to differentiate between causes of bone marrow pathology and to detect microfracture lines, while fluid-sensitive T2-weighted images are used for edema in acute trauma and chronic knee pain (Level of evidence: low).

- **Comprehensive assessment**: The radiologist's assessment should include evaluation of all ligamentous structures, menisci, cartilage, bony structures, bursae, joint alignment, soft tissues, and incidental findings, regardless of a narrow clinical indication (Level of evidence: moderate).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for suspected ACL and meniscal tears of the knee [^115ijErj]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) in diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial meniscus, and lateral meniscus tears in individuals with suspected ACL and/or meniscal tears.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2014. All prospective studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of MRI or US against arthroscopy as the reference standard were included in the systematic review. Studies with a retrospective design and those showing evidence of verification bias were excluded. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating MRI to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity for each target condition was performed using a bivariate model with random effects. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses were used to examine the effect of methodological and other study variables.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis of the accuracy of MRI for ACL tears, 19 studies for medial meniscal tears, and 19 studies for lateral meniscal tears. The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 87% (95% CI 77–94%) and 93% (95% CI 91–96%), respectively, for ACL tears; 89% (95% CI 83–94%) and 88% (95% CI 82–93%), respectively, for medial meniscal tears; and 78% (95% CI 66–87%) and 95% (95% CI 91–97%), respectively, for lateral meniscal tears. Magnetic field strength had no significant effect on accuracy. Most studies had a high or unclear risk of bias.

### Reduction in inappropriate MRI knee studies after implementation of an appropriateness checklist: Experience at a tertiary care centre [^114jJWYt]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Purpose: The study aimed to evaluate the reduction in inappropriate knee MRI requests following the implementation of a mandatory knee MRI appropriateness checklist.

Methods: A retrospective review was performed at a single tertiary care centre. A knee MRI appropriateness checklist was developed based on the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, and adherence by referring physicians was mandatory. Reports from 200 consecutive knee MRI studies one year prior to implementation were compared to 200 consecutive knee MRI studies following implementation. The presence of moderate or greater osteoarthritis on MRI reports was used as a marker for inappropriate knee MRIs. Patient demographics, wait times, number of knee MRIs, and number of all MRIs at our centre over a six-month period post-intervention and pre-intervention were recorded. Differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention presence of moderate or greater osteoarthritis, patient demographics, wait times, and number of MRIs were analyzed.

Results: A significant decrease was found in moderate or greater grade osteoarthritis following intervention, decreasing from 36.5% to 20.5% (73 studies versus 41 studies, p = 0.023). Of these, the most profound decrease occurred in studies with severe osteoarthritis, with an 80% decrease (35 studies versus 7 studies, p < 0.001). Post intervention, 48% fewer knee MRIs were performed in the same time interval (652 studies pre-intervention versus 336 studies post intervention, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in patient demographics.

Conclusion: The mandatory knee MRI appropriateness checklist led to a significant reduction in inappropriate MRI knee studies, reflecting its effectiveness in clinical practice.

### MR imaging of anterior knee pain: A pictorial essay [^115JbL5B]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pathology is a frequent cause of joint pain and limitation of function and mobility among patients presenting to an orthopaedic department. Proper recognition and treatment of pathologic conditions depend on the knowledge of normal anatomy and of the various abnormalities which affect this area of the knee and may present with anterior knee pain. A broad array of benign and malignant processes may manifest as anterior knee discomfort, and this common clinical entity is among the most frequent indications for MR imaging of the lower extremities. Clinical history and physical examination are also of paramount importance.

- **Disorders classified by location**: Traumatic or non-traumatic disorders of the patella, patellar retinacula, quadriceps and patellar tendons, and supra- or infrapatellar fat pad can be the source of symptoms. This article includes a comprehensive pictorial essay of the characteristic MR features of common and uncommon disorders causing anterior knee pain.

For accurate assessment of the aforementioned clinical problem, a radiologist should be able to identify typical MR imaging patterns that contribute to establishing the correct diagnosis and thus tailoring the appropriate therapy. Level of evidence IV.

### Contrast-enhanced MRI findings of the knee in healthy children; establishing normal values [^112DCVtW]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, findings from 57 healthy children (77.2% female patients) with a mean age of 13.6 years (SD 3.1, range 6.7–17.8 years) were included and analyzed.

Of the included children, 31 out of 57 (54.4%) had passing knee complaints without a known cause, 8 out of 58 (14.0%) had joint complaints based on a hypermobility syndrome, and 18 out of 58 (31.6%) had complaints based on a functional disorder or chronic pain syndrome. No significant differences in descriptive statistics, clinical findings, or laboratory findings were found between the three different subgroups of children included.

- **Patient characteristics**: An overview of the clinical characteristics of the included patients is depicted in Table 1.

	- Except where otherwise indicated, values are median (interquartile range).
	- Measured on a 0–100 mm visual analogue scale (0 = best, 100 = worst).
	- Units; 0 = best, 3 = worst.

- **MRI findings**: Of the included children, 40 (70.2%) were scanned using the 1.0-T magnet and 17 (29.8%) children were scanned using the 3.0-T magnet. No significant differences in MRI findings were found between the two systems. Moreover, no significant differences in MRI findings were found between the three different subgroups of children included.

### Longitudinal assessment of femoral knee cartilage quality using contrast enhanced MRI (dGEMRIC) in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury — comparison with asymptomatic volunteers [^1124b41n]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

In this observational longitudinal study, we estimate knee joint cartilage glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in patients with an acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, with or without a concomitant meniscus injury.

- **Methods**: 29 knees (19 men, 10 women) were prospectively examined by repeat delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC), approximately 3 weeks and 2.3 ± 1.3 (range 4.5) years after the injury. We estimated the GAG content (T1Gd) in the central weight-bearing parts of the medial and lateral femoral cartilage and compared results with a reference cohort (n = 24) with normal knees and no history of injury that were examined by dGEMRIC on one occasion previously.

- **Results**: The healthy reference group had longer T1Gd values compared with the ACL-injured patients at follow-up both medially: 428 ± 38 vs 363 ± 61ms (P < 0.0001) and laterally: 445 ± 41 vs 396 ± 48ms (P = 0.0002). At follow-up, T1Gd was lower in meniscectomized patients compared to those without a meniscectomy, both medially (-84ms, P = 0.002) and laterally (-38ms, P = 0.05). In the injured group, the medial femoral cartilage showed similar T1Gd at the two dGEMRIC investigations: 357 ± 50 vs 363 ± 61ms (P = 0.57), whereas the lateral femoral cartilage T1Gd increased: 374 ± 48 vs 396 ± 48ms (P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: The general decrease in cartilage T1Gd in ACL-injured patients compared with references provides evidence for structural matrix GAG changes that seem more pronounced if a concomitant meniscal injury is present.

The fact that post-traumatic OA commonly develops in ACL-injured patients suggests a need for ongoing monitoring.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage [^111ytTE8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the optimal modality for assessing articular cartilage due to its superior soft tissue contrast, direct visualization of articular cartilage, and multiplanar capability. Despite these advantages, there has been disagreement regarding the efficacy of MRI for articular cartilage. This controversy is multifactorial, partly due to the lack of optimized pulse sequences tailored for articular cartilage.

The authors review the state of the art of MRI of articular cartilage and cartilage repair procedures, discuss future directions in imaging strategies, and methods being developed to measure cartilage thickness and volume. They propose an MRI protocol to evaluate cartilage that is achievable on most MRI scanners, vendor-independent, practical (time and cost-efficient), and broadly accepted and used by the majority of musculoskeletal radiologists.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in acute traumatic and chronic meniscal tears of the knee: a diagnostic accuracy study in young adults [^111AtjRx]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

No previous research has investigated the diagnostic validity of magnetic resonance imaging for acute versus chronic meniscal tears using comparable materials and methods. The hypothesis was that there is no difference in the diagnostic validity of magnetic resonance imaging for acute versus chronic meniscal tears in young adults.

- **Study design**: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: A total of 628 young adult military personnel underwent magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy of the knee over a 6-year period. Inclusion criteria were met by 82 patients with acute knee trauma (magnetic resonance imaging within 30 days from trauma) and 40 patients with chronic knee symptoms (symptoms lasting over 6 months before magnetic resonance imaging). The original magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy records were reviewed twice by a musculoskeletally trained radiologist, blinded to previous magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy findings. Interobserver correlations and intraobserver reliability were calculated and reported. Arthroscopy served as the gold standard when calculating the diagnostic values of magnetic resonance imaging for acute and chronic meniscal tears.

- **Results**: The median age of the patients was 20 years (range, 18–25). Magnetic resonance imaging detected acute meniscal tears with a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 93%, and diagnostic accuracy of 88% and chronic meniscal tears with 64%, 91%, and 86%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in magnetic resonance imaging results between the two groups.

### Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the compartmental prevalence of knee joint structural damage [^116LswGw]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

To describe the prevalence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected structural damage in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) and tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) in a population-based cohort, 970 knees (one knee per subject) from the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study were assessed. This cohort study included persons aged 51–92 years. Cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) were evaluated using the Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). The prevalence of isolated PFJ, isolated TFJ, and mixed structural damage was determined based on the presence of any cartilage damage, full thickness cartilage loss, any BML, and the combination of full thickness cartilage loss with any BML.

The mean age and BMI of participants were 63.4 years and 28.6 kg/m², respectively, with 57% being female. Isolated PFJ damage occurred in 15–20% of knees and isolated TFJ damage occurred in 8–17% of knees, depending on the definitions used. The prevalence of isolated PFJ damage was consistently greater than isolated TFJ damage across all definitions except for the any BML definition. This pattern was observed across genders and among different age and BMI categories. In subjects with knee pain, isolated PFJ damage was at least as common as TFJ damage, depending on the definition used.

The study concludes that using MRI to assess knee joint structural damage, isolated PFJ damage is at least as common as, if not more common than, isolated TFJ damage.

### Knee MRI primary care ordering practices for nontraumatic knee pain: Compliance with ACR appropriateness criteria and its effect on clinical management [^111Psxeu]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

To evaluate the appropriateness of MRI ordering practices and their effect on clinical management for nontraumatic knee pain at the primary care clinics of a large public urban hospital, 196 consecutive MRIs for nontraumatic knee pain were studied over an 18-month period. ACR Appropriateness Criteria (AC) scores for nontraumatic knee pain were retrospectively calculated from medical record reviews. The records were also reviewed to assess whether knee MRI changed clinical management. Knee osteoarthritis grading was performed. Tests were conducted for differences in age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and ethnicity among appropriate and inappropriate MRIs.

Of the MRIs, 57% (108 knees) had "usually appropriate" (i.e. scores of 7–9) and 43% (8 knees) had "usually not appropriate" (i.e. scores of 1–3) AC scores (P > .1). Clinical management was changed in 26% of knees with "usually appropriate" scores and in 20% of knees with "usually inappropriate" scores (P < .05). Additionally, 70% of the knees with "usually appropriate" scores and 61% of the knees with "usually not appropriate" scores had moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Age, BMI, gender, and ethnicity had no significant effect on AC scores.

In conclusion, the study found that in patients referred from primary care for MRI for nontraumatic knee pain, adherence to AC was low. There is a need for additional focus on reducing "appropriate" studies that do not impact clinical management, especially in cases with radiographically evident moderate to severe osteoarthritis.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the knee: Is contrast needed to score disease activity when using an augmented MRI protocol comprising PD-weighted sequences [^1132NCPD]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Advances in MRI hardware and software development, along with improved image quality and the use of artificial intelligence programs for image interpretation, will likely enhance the assessment of unenhanced images. This study contributes to the re-evaluation of the necessity and benefits of contrast agents in monitoring the disease activity of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Hemke et al. reported that the reliability of the JAMRIS score for assessing synovial thickening decreases when omitting contrast agents in MRI examinations of the knee at 1 Tesla. Based on our data, no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy was found when using enhanced or unenhanced images with the clinical JADAS10 as a reference.

In our study, we compared unenhanced and enhanced images and included PD-weighted MRI, allowing us to hypothesize that the accuracy of unenhanced images can be increased by the additional evaluation of PD-weighted sequences. Furthermore, the higher magnetic field strength of 3 Tesla, used in our study, might lead to improved spatial resolution compared to the magnetic field strength of 1 Tesla used by Hemke et al. Nevertheless, a recent review published on behalf of the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) arthritis subcommittee and the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) indicated that the diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced MRI is limited compared to contrast-enhanced MRI due to the reduced ability to evaluate synovitis. In this article, recommendations are based on a literature review (including Hemke et al.) and expert opinion.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^117TYB3G]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anterior cruciate ligament injury, more specifically with respect to knee MRI, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a knee MRI or knee CTA as the next imaging modality for the evaluation of suspected additional bone or soft tissue injury following a fall or acute twisting trauma to the knee in patients aged ≥ 5 years with a radiographic diagnosis of tibial plateau fracture.

### How useful is MRI in diagnosing isolated bundle ACL injuries [^116R4PB1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Selective bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and/or remnant ACL preservation may be reasonable options for some patients. However, the frequency of isolated anteromedial (AM) or posterolateral (PL) bundle injuries in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction is unknown, and the value of MRI for predicting this injury pattern is likewise unknown.

- **Questions/Purposes**: We sought to determine (1) the proportion of knees with an intact AM or PL bundle in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction; (2) whether MRI predicted the bundle conditions seen at the time of surgery; and (3) whether the accuracy of the MRI prediction was affected by the timing of MRI after injury.

- **Methods**: During primary ACL reconstructions of 156 knees, conditions of AM and PL bundles were separately examined and classified into three categories: (1) completely torn; (2) attenuated; and (3) intact. Bundles were then assessed by blinded observers on MRI and classified into the corresponding three categories for 77 patients who had an MRI at our institution using a standard protocol. Diagnostic accuracy of MRI was computed, and the early MRI group (≤ 6 weeks from injury to MRI acquisition) was compared with the late MRI group (> 6 weeks).

- **Results**: Only 11 (7%) of the 156 knees we treated had an intact AM (one knee) or PL bundle (10 knees). Another 55 knees (35%) had a structurally continuous but attenuated AM or PL bundle. The overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI was 83%; accuracy was better for the AM bundle than the PL bundle (91% versus 78%; p = 0.026). MR prediction was less accurate in…

### The clinical utility and diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging for identification of early and advanced knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^111DWDk5]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic strategies for the detection of structural articular cartilage abnormalities, which are the earliest structural signs of osteoarthritis, often fail to capture the condition until it is too advanced for the most potential benefit from noninvasive interventions.

- **Purpose**: To systematically review the literature relative to the following questions: (1) Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valid, sensitive, specific, accurate, and reliable instrument for identifying knee articular cartilage abnormalities compared with arthroscopy? (2) Is MRI a sensitive tool that can be utilized to identify early cartilage degeneration?

- **Study design**: Systematic review.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in November 2010 using PubMed MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), SPORTDiscus (from 1985), SCOPUS (from 1996), and EMBASE (from 1974) databases.

- **Results**: Fourteen level I and 13 level II studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and provided information related to the diagnostic performance of MRI compared with arthroscopic evaluation. The diagnostic performance of MRI demonstrated a large range of sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies. The sensitivity for identifying articular cartilage abnormalities in the knee joint was reported between 26% and 96%. Specificity and accuracy were reported between 50% and 100% and between 49% and 94%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying early osteoarthritis were reported between 0% and 86%, 48% and 95%, and 5% and 94%, respectively. As a result of inconsistencies between imaging techniques, further research is warranted.

### MRI is not reliable in diagnosing of concomitant anterolateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament injuries of the knee [^116EkhaY]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The anterolateral structures of the knee, including the anterolateral ligament (ALL), have garnered renewed interest as distinct entities. Recognizing injury to the ALL poses challenges, primarily due to the subjective nature of physical examination. Consequently, there has been a shift in focus towards using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperative diagnosis in this region. This study aims to evaluate the ability of 3-Tesla (3T) MRI to identify the ALL in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries compared to a control group of ACL-intact patients. The hypothesis assumes that the ALL would be more difficult to identify in ACL-injured patients compared to those without ACL injuries.

A prospective case-control study was conducted, comparing 3T MRI scans of 63 patients with ACL ruptures against a control group of 64 patients without ACL injuries. An experienced musculoskeletal radiologist, along with an orthopedic surgeon, analyzed the scans using standard knee protocols. The ALL was examined in three regions: femoral, meniscal, and tibial. Each section of the ALL was categorized as either visualized or non-visualized, and its integrity was assessed as intact, attenuated, or displaying focal discontinuity.

- **Results**: The detection rate of at least a portion of the ALL was 64% in the control group (41/64) and 72% in the ACL-injured cohort (45/63). However, identifying the entire length of the ALL was possible in only 23% of the control group (15/64) and 21% of the ACL-injured cases (13/63). In both groups, the visibility of the ALL was poorest in the femoral region.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the knee: Is contrast needed to score disease activity when using an augmented MRI protocol comprising PD-weighted sequences [^114WspaJ]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare unenhanced versus enhanced knee joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease activity of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Methods: Fifty-three knee joint MRI examinations were performed on a 3-Tesla system in 27 patients (age: 11.40 ± 3.61 years; 21 females, 6 males). The MRI protocols comprised PD-weighted sequences in addition to the widely used standard protocol. JIA subgroups comprised oligoarticular arthritis (n = 16), extended oligoarthritis (n = 6), rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular arthritis (n = 3), enthesitis-related arthritis (n = 1), and psoriatic arthritis (n = 1). MR images were retrospectively analyzed by three experienced radiologists in two readings, using the JAMRIS (juvenile arthritis MRI scoring) system and a modified IPSG (International Prophylaxis Study Group) classification. In the first reading session, only unenhanced MR images were evaluated. In a second reading session, all images before and after contrast medium application were included. To avoid bias, an interval of at least two weeks was set between the two readings. The clinical JADAS10 (juvenile arthritis disease activity score) was calculated, including clinical assessment and laboratory workup, and correlated with MRI scores. Statistical analysis comprised Pearson's correlation for correlating two scoring results of unenhanced and enhanced MRI, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter- and intra-reader agreement. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated using ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve analysis.

### Sensitivity of routine 1.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging versus arthroscopy as gold standard in fresh traumatic chondral lesions of the knee in young adults [^116QfYup]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of routine 1.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus arthroscopy in detecting fresh traumatic chondral lesions of the knee.

Over a period of 6 years, 578 consecutive military personnel underwent MRI before arthroscopy of the knee. Of these, 32 patients with arthroscopically proven fresh traumatic chondral lesions of the knee were chosen for further analysis. A supplementary condition was that arthroscopy was performed no later than 6 weeks after the onset of trauma. The original MRIs and hospital records were re-evaluated, and the chondral lesions were graded and compared with arthroscopic findings. The arthroscopic results served as the gold standard when the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI were calculated.

The age of the patients ranged from 19 to 21 years (mean, 19.6 years). MRI detected cartilage defects with a sensitivity of 36% (95% confidence interval, 23% to 50%), specificity of 91% (95% CI, 85% to 95%), and diagnostic accuracy of 78% (95% CI, 72% to 83%). MRI results were affected by the grade of the chondral lesions.

This study shows that routine 1.0-T MRI is not sensitive but is specific and somewhat accurate in detecting fresh traumatic articular cartilage lesions. The hypothesis of this study was that 1.0-T MRI could replace diagnostic arthroscopy in the diagnosis of fresh traumatic chondral lesions. Our results fail to support this hypothesis because of the poor sensitivity obtained with MRI.

### Feasibility of an accelerated 2D-multi-contrast knee MRI protocol using deep-learning image reconstruction: A prospective intraindividual comparison with a standard MRI protocol [^112qgUw8]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is among the most commonly performed MRI examinations and requires about 15 minutes of acquisition time. Reference standards for knee MRI are proton density (PD)– and T1–weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences, which provide excellent tissue contrast and high in-plane spatial resolution, facilitating good assessment of meniscal, ligamentous, and cartilaginous injuries.

Due to their anisotropic voxel size, two-dimensional (2D)–TSE sequences require the acquisition of different image planes separately, which is time-consuming. One approach to accelerate MRI of the knee is the use of three-dimensional (3D)–TSE techniques, which generate isotropic data sets of higher spatial resolution, allowing the creation of virtually any image plane from a single parental data set. Although technical developments can provide accelerated imaging, mainly based on parallel imaging (PI) acceleration, the acquisition time for a high-quality isotropic data set with 3D–TSE still requires around 5 to 10 minutes. Furthermore, with increasing acceleration in PI, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases rapidly, while residual artifacts generally increase, which limits the achievable speed.

Another innovative technique commonly used to accelerate MRI is compressed sensing (CS), in which only a reduced set of data points is required. SNR is preserved better than by PI alone; however, CS tends to oversimplify image content, resulting in residual blurring and a loss of realistic image textures.

The latest promising approaches to address these drawbacks are deep-learning (DL) algorithms. These advanced methods…

### The ABCs of the anterior cruciate ligament: A primer for magnetic resonance imaging assessment of the normal, injured and surgically repaired anterior cruciate ligament [^113cxKXv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the native and reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). MRI is the most accurate non-invasive modality to evaluate the ACL. Tears of the ACL manifest with direct and indirect signs. The reconstructed ACL has several complications, including re-tear and anterior arthrofibrosis, which are also accurately assessed using MRI.

### How to optimize the use of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction [^112uunE2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most diagnostic imaging procedure for suspected ACL injuries. It is an accurate, highly sensitive, and specific tool for diagnosing ACL tears, graft tears, and associated injuries. However, it can also be used for various other aspects of anatomic ACL reconstruction.

- **Methods**: Special sequences, such as the oblique sagittal plane, should be obtained from a parallel line to the lateral epicondyle, ensuring proper visualization of both bundles of the ACL. Another special set of images, the oblique-coronal sequence, allows for ACL long-axis evaluation. The coronal-oblique sequence increases the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing isolated AM or PL bundle injuries and also helps visualize the proximal insertion of the bundles for hemorrhage and rupture.

- **Results**: Quantitative measurements can be taken from a proper MRI protocol to determine the rupture pattern, measure insertion site size, inclination angle, and autograft size, and evaluate for post-operative complications. These parameters help surgeons objectively decide on a better graft and technique for an individualized approach and to evaluate the anatomic placement of the graft.

- **Conclusions**: MRI can be used in different ways, serving as a very valuable tool in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Special protocols can provide accurate visualization of the double-bundle anatomy. Objective parameters to aid in pre-operative decisions and graft's anatomic placement evaluation can also be extracted from the MR images.

### Lower extremity MRI: Are their requests always appropriate in France [^115R5wj1]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Apart from the 2012 CNAM study, we have not found any other study about the relevance of lower extremity MRI or knee MRI in France. A survey carried out in 2020 by the Académie Nationale de Médecine among 260 patients seen consecutively on the same day at an osteoarticular imaging center showed that 70% of MRI requests were incomplete, with the reason for the request specified for only 14% of patients. The authors underline the importance of integrating the obligation to provide sufficient clinical information into e-prescription software.

Internationally, a recent systematic review of the literature concerning the appropriateness of diagnostic imaging found that for MRI of extremities, the overall appropriateness rate was 66% (n = 352/535). It is worth noting that the four underlying studies varied in sample size (55–300) and results (55–83%). One of the studies is focused on the knee; based on the availability of an electronic medical record (EMR) for every MRI performed in the Elche Health Department in Spain, the authors found that in 45% of cases (N = 135/300) the MRI prescription was inappropriate. The main situations of inappropriateness included the use of MRI as the initial imaging technique.

The inappropriateness of knee MRI has also been studied in other countries and has shown that practices could be improved. In the United States, George et al. found that 22.8% of MRI examinations for non-traumatic knee pain conducted in 2010 among Medicare and private insurance patients had been performed without prior radiography in the same calendar year.

### Spectrum of injuries associated with paediatric ACL tears: An MRI pictorial review [^112GA3WM]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The posterior lateral meniscus is intermingled with the meniscofemoral ligament of Wrisberg and/or Humphrey and, in rare cases, the oblique menisco-meniscal ligament. This amalgamation complicates the assessment for tears, a phenomenon extensively studied in adults. Practically, if the ligament-to-meniscus attachment appears irregular or continues to a slice where the fibula is visible, a tear is likely present.

- **Posterior lateral meniscus tear**:
	a. Sagittal PD image reveals a cleft between the posterior third of the lateral meniscus (arrow) and the meniscofemoral ligament of Wrisberg (arrowhead). Medially, near the intercondylar notch, these structures are distinct (note that this slice contains the patellar tendon, curved arrow), but they merge laterally.
	b. Normal appearance on a more lateral slice, where the fibular head is visible (curved arrow): the posterior lateral meniscus appears as a single triangular structure.
	c. Oblique, mostly vertical undisplaced tear of the posterior lateral meniscus (arrow). The cleft is considered abnormal when observed laterally on an image where the fibular head is visible. Note that Fig. 6c shows a similar displaced tear.
	d. Complex tear of the same meniscus region (arrow).

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^113R5ZKp]. European radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The four main stabilizing ligaments of the knee are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL). They provide stability to the knee during flexion-extension, valgus-varus movement, and internal and external rotation. Additionally, other capsular structures and muscle tendons, particularly in the posteromedial and posterolateral corners, provide further stability to the knee. Anterolateral capsular structures are considered important secondary rotational stabilizers in the knee.

All ligaments normally appear as dark signal structures on T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images. The cruciate ligaments each consist of two bundles visible in all planes; the ACL appears more striated than the PCL. This should not be misinterpreted as a partial-thickness rupture of the ACL. Ligament pathology presents as increased signal, thickening or thinning of the ligaments, or discontinuity of fibers (Fig. 2 A–D).

Bony avulsions at either the proximal or distal attachments of both the cruciate and collateral ligaments may also occur and should not be overlooked. An associated avulsion is the Segond fracture, i.e. a small avulsion of the anterolateral tibial rim where the iliotibial band and anterolateral capsule attach, often linked with an ACL rupture in adult patients.

- **Arcuate complex**: This occurs when the conjoined LCL and biceps femoris tendon attachment avulses the proximal fibular head; this finding is associated with an ACL rupture (Fig. 2 D–E).

The PCL differs from the ACL in its…

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation-a systematic review [^113W1VFc]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

To calculate positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), specificity, and sensitivity, the frequency/ratio of mature and immature knees per age, as well as the age distribution of the population tested, must be known. The risk of misclassification depends on the actual age distribution of those tested. For example, if many individuals are tested in the age range of 17 to 18 years, the risk of misclassification is high. Conversely, if the age range is widened, the proportion of errors will be lower.

To illustrate this issue, calculations were performed on five hypothetical populations, each with a different age distribution.

- **Table 4: Number of individuals per age in five different hypothetical populations**.

Using data from the study by Ottow et al. (male), we illustrate how the same data points give rise to different predictive values in response to variation in the age distribution of the population tested. This is further elaborated in Supplement 6, where predictive values using data points from other included studies on the same five hypothetical populations are presented. The calculations show that NPV, PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for MRI of the knee as a test to determine whether a person is over or under 18 years old cannot be calculated in individuals between 15 and 21 years of age unless the exact age composition of the group is known.

### MRI for the evaluation of knee pain: Comparison of ordering practices of primary care physicians and orthopaedic surgeons [^112Jarjw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Knee pain is one of the most common reasons for outpatient visits in the U.S. The majority of these cases can be effectively evaluated through physical examination and judicious use of radiography. Despite this, an increasing number of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the knee are being ordered for patients with incomplete work-ups or inappropriate indications. We hypothesized that MRIs ordered by orthopaedic providers were more likely to result in changes in diagnoses and/or plans for care than those ordered by non-orthopaedic providers.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of all consecutive new patients seen at our orthopaedic outpatient office between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for meniscal or unspecified sprains and strains of the knee. A total of 1,592 patients met our inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: those initially evaluated and referred by their primary care physician (PCP) (n = 747) and those initially evaluated by one of our staff orthopaedic surgeons (n = 845).

- **Results**: MRI-ordering rates were nearly identical between orthopaedic surgeons and PCPs (25.0% versus 24.8%; p = 0.945). However, MRIs ordered by orthopaedic surgeons resulted in significantly more arthroscopic interventions than those ordered by PCPs (41.2% versus 31.4%; p = 0.042). Orthopaedic surgeons ordered MRIs for patients who were more likely to benefit from arthroscopic intervention, including patients who were younger (mean age 45.1 years versus 56.5 years).

### Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features on magnetic resonance imaging in asymptomatic uninjured adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113w3fLA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In this systematic review, summary estimates of the prevalence of MRI features suggestive of osteoarthritis among otherwise healthy, asymptomatic, uninjured knees ranged from 4% to 14% in young adults, and 19% to 43% in older adults aged ≥ 40 years. These imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of clinical presentations and considered in clinical decision making.

- **What is already known on this subject**: Increasing availability of MRI has resulted in a rapid rise in its utilization to help inform clinical management of patients with knee symptoms, yet the overall clinical benefit of the use of knee MRI is uncertain. Community-based studies have reported a high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features detected by MRI, but these cohorts include people with knee pain and a history of knee injury, a well-established risk factor for the accelerated development of knee osteoarthritis.

- **What are the new findings**: The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features on MRI in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic, uninjured knees is high — up to 43% in adults aged ≥ 40 years. Prevalence rates generally increase with age and are influenced by other factors such as physical activity levels and type of MRI sequences used.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^11436asj]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Fluid-sensitive sequences can vary considerably, and the choice of weighting must be adjusted according to the scanner and local preference of the reporting radiologist. In acute knee trauma, an MRI should always be accompanied by a radiograph (or computed tomography) of the knee to avoid missing small bony avulsions. If bone marrow pathology is detected first on MRI, radiographs or CT may be performed to supplement the MRI if the diagnosis is uncertain. This should not be misinterpreted as "radiographs are unnecessary" or that MRI of the knee should be the first modality regardless of clinical indication. Level of evidence of recommendation: 4/Low.

- **Clinical indications for knee MRI**: The optimal use of MRI is best decided in conjunction with key local stakeholders, but there are some overarching principles. MRI of the knee is indicated in acute knee trauma with suspected internal derangement and in the course of posttraumatic assessment. It is also indicated in clinically unexplained chronic knee pain when prior radiographs are non-diagnostic. Some imaging centers vary their knee MRI protocols according to the clinical query. However, even though clinical history improves MRI diagnostics, important incidental or concomitant findings may be missed if all structures are not routinely evaluated.

- **Basic image assessment**: The assessment should include evaluation of the menisci (including roots), ligamentous structures and tendons, cartilage, bone and bone marrow, soft tissues, bursae, and femorotibial and patellar alignment, as well as any incidental findings.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation-a systematic review [^112vsz3U]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The literature search yielded 2,529 references to be screened (see Fig. 1). Of these, 39 were reviewed in full text, and a total of 16 articles were considered eligible since they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the eligible articles, 13 had a low or moderate risk of bias and are included in the analysis. The risk of bias chart is shown in Supplement 5. Three articles had a high risk of bias: one due to an inadequate description of the MRI method, one lacking complete information regarding birth date, and one due to several limitations. See Supplement 2 for the list of excluded studies. The characteristics of the included studies are presented in Supplement 4.

- **Study characteristics**: Out of the 13 studies, 9 were retrospective and 4 prospective. The studies originated from Iran, Turkey, Germany, Sweden, France, and the United States. The study population consisted of various subjects, such as patients who underwent MRI for assessment of traumatic or degenerative changes to the knee joint, healthy volunteers (4 studies), and individuals assessed for legal reasons (1 study). The information provided regarding the study population was sparse in most papers.

- **MRI grading systems**: The studies used 6 different grading systems for evaluation of the maturation stage of the knee on MRI: Schmeling and Kellinghaus, Vieth, Dedouit, Dedouit and Kellinghaus (modified version of Schmeling), Jopp, and Schmeling. The MRI grading systems differ both in terms of the number and the definition of stages of maturation. Stages varied between 3 and 5, with up to 11 substages.

### The diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^115KAjaE]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for osteochondritis dissecans, specifically in relation to knee MRI, the AAOS 2023 guidelines recommend considering a knee MRI to characterize the osteochondritis dissecans lesion. This consideration applies in patients with a known osteochondritis dissecans lesion on X-ray or when concomitant knee pathology, such as meniscal pathology, ACL injury, or articular cartilage injury, is suspected.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^116ReU5E]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disorder of the joint characterized by knee pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. The global prevalence of knee OA is estimated to be over 350 million, contributing to up to 60% of the burden of all sites of OA. Knee OA imparts substantial direct and indirect health economic burdens on individuals and society globally.

Radiographic examination (X-ray) of the knee joint has been widely used as a tool to diagnose radiographic OA (ROA). Various grading scales, such as the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) scale, are commonly used to define ROA, typically KL grade ≥ 2. However, the early underlying knee OA changes, such as early articular cartilage abnormalities, are unnoticed in radiographs, making radiographic examination unreliable in identifying individuals with early knee OA. Knee OA often progresses unrecognized until it advances to an irreversible stage, with significant articular degradation already occurred when definitive knee OA, based on radiographic evaluation — such as KL grade ≥ 2 — can be ascertained. Since early knee OA can start long before it becomes evident on radiographs, more sensitive techniques such as MRI are being explored for early diagnosis of knee OA.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^111GwJK1]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

The presence of cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions (BMLs), assessed through semiquantitative methods, has long been established to be associated with knee symptoms. Most studies have consistently reported an association of BMLs with knee pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Similarly, cartilage defects, especially higher-grade ones, have been found to be associated with knee symptoms. However, the literature examining the association of MRI anomalies with knee symptoms has primarily focused on elderly participants or patients with confirmed knee OA. There is a lack of studies examining the association between MRI-based morphological or structural markers and knee symptoms in a general middle-aged population. It is essential to understand the structural correlates of knee pain in early life, which may represent early knee OA, to develop targeted preventive and treatment strategies for early knee OA. Hence, our aim was to describe the associations between OA-related MRI biomarkers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in middle-aged adults.

### Reporting knee meniscal tears: Technical aspects, typical pitfalls and how to avoid them [^112hSsj2]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The routinely used MRI sequences are two-dimensional (2D), fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences (proton-density (PD)-weighted, T1-weighted sequences, and T2- and T1-weighted sequences with and without fat suppression). When comparing with spin-echo (SE) sequences, FSE sequences facilitate the examination in a shorter overall time without statistically significant differences in meniscal tear detection rate. By using high-magnetic field strength with dedicated coils and parallel imaging techniques, the scan time may be decreased even more. Some particular types of meniscal tears have been proven to be better evaluated on specific sequences (e.g. coronal T2-weighted images showed a 96% diagnostic accuracy compared with 85% accuracy of PD-weighted coronal images for diagnosis of medial meniscal roots tears).

Most authors still prefer standard two-dimensional over three-dimensional fast spin echo sequences and over gradient echo sequences, because the former provide classic, well-known T1-, T2-, and intermediate-weighted contrast information and enable detection of subtle abnormalities of the meniscus and ligaments. This is in contradiction to the fact that with three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo (GRE) and 3D fast spin-echo FSE sequences, thinner sections with decreased partial volume averaging and isotropic voxel imaging with multiplanar reformations (that potentially reduce the examination time) are possible. Indeed, several studies have shown that 3D isotropic FSE sequences can provide rapid knee joint evaluation. By using 3D fat-saturated PD FSE sequences, a more comprehensive assessment can be achieved.

### Predictive factors for new onset or progression of knee osteoarthritis one year after trauma: MRI follow-up in general practice [^117JGkuu]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 3 to 6 weeks of trauma and repeated after approximately 1 year of follow-up. For both examinations, we applied the same technique and pulse sequences, using a 1.0 Tesla whole-body MRI unit and a dedicated knee coil. The imaging protocol consisted of sagittal T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, coronal T2✱-weighted gradient echo and fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, and an axial proton density-weighted fast spin-echo sequence.

The initial and follow-up MRI examinations were evaluated for the presence of degenerative abnormalities of the femorotibial joint. For this purpose, we used the items of the Knee Osteoarthritis Scoring System (KOSS). To grade the severity of osteoarthritis, we used the Kellgren and Lawrence scoring system, which was originally developed for grading osteoarthritic change on conventional radiography.

- **Severity grading**:
	- **Grade 0**: No degenerative abnormalities.
	- **Grade 1**: Minimal osteophyte of unknown significance.
	- **Grade 2**: Osteophytes without joint space narrowing.
	- **Grade 3**: Moderate joint space narrowing.
	- **Grade 4**: Severe joint space narrowing with sclerosis of subchondral bone.

In addition to degenerative abnormalities, including meniscal lesions and bone marrow edema, we assessed the presence of ligamentous lesions on the initial MRI. Findings were documented on a standardized report form.

### New-generation 0.55 T MRI of the knee-initial clinical experience and comparison with 3 T MRI [^112Xa94M]. Investigative Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Internal derangement of the knee is one of the most common indications for MRI of the musculoskeletal system. Consequently, the knee is a commonly imaged joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the imaging standard due to the superior soft tissue contrast when compared with other imaging modalities. Although both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI can provide diagnostic images, 3 T MRI is generally preferred at most institutions, providing higher image resolution. This is in keeping with a contemporary meta-analysis suggesting benefits of 3 T over 1.5 T knee MRI. Moreover, increasing literature is being published regarding the potential of ultra-high field 7 T MRI of the knee, which may offer superior assessment of joint cartilage.

- **New-generation low-field MRI**: Perhaps contradicting the trend of greater field strength knee MRI for more detailed analyses, we hypothesized that new-generation low-field MRI allows for diagnostic knee examinations in clinical practice. It is able to answer common referrer queries, which include the identification of trauma sequelae of the ligaments, tendons, menisci, bone, and joint cartilage.

Thus, the purpose of our study was to compare the detection rate and reader confidence in new-generation 0.55 T knee MRI findings with 3 T knee MRI in patients with knee pain after acute trauma.

### Preoperative MRI for the multiligament knee injury: What the surgeon needs to know [^111cCtyi]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The multiligament knee injury is devastating and potentially limb-threatening. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of this type of injury is an invaluable clinical tool. When the radiologist is familiar with how certain injury patterns influence management, optimal outcomes can be achieved. This study provides a detailed description of the relationship between salient imaging features of the multiligament knee injury, with a focus on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, and their influence on clinical decision-making.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the multiple-ligament injured knee [^113NbbdT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in detecting soft tissue, neurovascular, and bony injury after multiple ligament knee injury, including knee dislocation, a retrospective search was performed. This search included patients presenting with reported knee dislocation from May 1993 through May 2000 who underwent both MRI and surgical reconstruction. Twenty-one patients met these criteria (15 men and six women; age range 14 to 75 years; mean 32.6 years). Magnetic resonance diagnoses of soft tissue and bony injury were compared with the patients' operative findings. MRA of the popliteal vessels was performed in seventeen of the twenty-one patients, and the results of these studies are described.

Multiple ligamentous, tendinous, meniscal, chondral, osseous, and neural injuries were identified. There was excellent correlation (kappa > 0.8) between the magnetic resonance and operative findings regarding the size and location of tears. For meniscal tears, the type (e.g. bucket, radial split, meniscocapsular separation) and location correlated well with surgical findings. All ten nerve injuries noted on magnetic resonance were confirmed during surgery. Six of the patients underwent both conventional angiograms and MRAs, which demonstrated 100 percent agreement between the studies. In one patient, an intimal flap in the popliteal artery was observed on MRA and confirmed on conventional angiographic images.

In conclusion, MRI is an accurate method of assessing soft tissue, osseous, and neural damage following knee dislocation.

### MRI deep learning models for assisted diagnosis of knee pathologies: A systematic review [^112gC3Pv]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Knee injuries are a prevalent health concern globally, affecting both pediatric and adult populations. Diagnosis involves clinical examination followed by imaging such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is crucial in diagnosing knee injuries due to its superior soft tissue contrast resolution. In-plane two-dimensional (2D) MRI knee studies are typically acquired in three orthogonal planes using a combination of sequences. While 2D knee MRI is useful for assessing various conditions, its limitations include restricted spatial resolution, partial volume effect (PVE), and geometrical constraints that may limit a thorough interrogation of selected small features of knee injuries. Additionally, 2D MRI does not allow image reconstruction onto arbitrary anatomical planes.

Advanced MRI sequences like three-dimensional (3D) MRI can gather larger data sets offering additional information compared to 2D MRI. 3D MRI sequences capture data volumes with higher spatial resolution and reduced PVE. Moreover, it enables image reconstruction on arbitrary diagnostic planes. Despite the radiologist's preference for multi-sequence 2D MRI due to their enhanced contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the traditional limitations of 3D MRI, including longer scan times, are now mitigated through high magnetic field scanners and compressed sensing techniques that expedite scan time. Furthermore, the recent application of deep-learning (DL) denoising algorithms into 3D MRI sequences has promised to deliver excellent improvements in CNR.

### 2018 International Olympic Committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^116RNfXs]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

No isolated question, test, or image can accurately identify an ACL injury every time. The measurement tools available to clinicians are not perfect, but they yield valuable information in the clinical context. Understanding the measurement properties of clinical tools helps clinicians balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of both clinical examination and MRI for ACL tears and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values. This indicates that if the clinical examination and MRI are negative for injury, the likelihood of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not guarantee the clinician can reliably confirm the diagnosis.

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The accuracy of clinical examination and MRI in intra-articular knee disorders involves understanding both positive and negative predictive values.

- **Treatment of ACL injuries in children**

This section addresses the question: what are the treatment options for a child with an ACL injury? Once a clinician confirms the injury diagnosis, they need to know the available treatment options and discuss these with the child and the child's parents or guardian. This ensures a shared decision-making process regarding the best management approach for the knee injury.

- **Goals of treatment**: The primary objectives for treating a child with an ACL injury are to restore a stable, well-functioning knee and enable a healthy, active lifestyle.

### Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features on magnetic resonance imaging in asymptomatic uninjured adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115UWrY1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Knee MRI is increasingly used to inform clinical management. Features associated with osteoarthritis are often present in asymptomatic uninjured knees; however, the estimated prevalence varies substantially between studies. We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to provide summary estimates of the prevalence of MRI features of osteoarthritis in asymptomatic uninjured knees.

- **Methods**: We searched six electronic databases for studies reporting MRI osteoarthritis feature prevalence (i.e. cartilage defects, meniscal tears, bone marrow lesions, and osteophytes) in asymptomatic uninjured knees. Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis and stratified by mean age: < 40 vs ≥ 40 years. Meta-regression explored heterogeneity.

- **Results**: We included 63 studies (5,397 knees of 4,751 adults). The overall pooled prevalence of cartilage defects was 24% (95% CI 15% to 34%) and meniscal tears was 10% (7% to 13%), with significantly higher prevalence with age: cartilage defect < 40 years 11% (6% to 17%) and ≥ 40 years 43% (29% to 57%); meniscal tear < 40 years 4% (2% to 7%) and ≥ 40 years 19% (13% to 26%). The overall pooled estimate of bone marrow lesions and osteophytes was 18% (12% to 24%) and 25% (14% to 38%), respectively, with prevalence of osteophytes (but not bone marrow lesions) increasing with age. Significant associations were found between prevalence estimates and MRI sequences used, physical activity, radiographic osteoarthritis, and risk of bias.
