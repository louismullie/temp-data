## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for chronic diseases of the tonsils. Then, I should verify the specific subcategory and code for chronic tonsillitis. Next, I will check for related codes that might be confused with chronic tonsillitis, such as chronic adenoiditis or combined disease. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with authoritative coding sources and clinical usage patterns.

> Let me first confirm the category. Chronic tonsillitis falls under J35, "Chronic diseases of tonsils and adenoids", which is the appropriate ICD-10-CM chapter and block for chronic upper respiratory conditions of the tonsils and adenoids, so I should anchor there before picking a subcode [^6ef7046c].

> Wait, let me verify the specific subcategory. Within J35, the subcategory J35.0 covers chronic tonsillitis and adenoiditis, and the most granular code for isolated chronic tonsillitis is J35.01, which is explicitly labeled "Chronic tonsillitis" in coding references and is the standard choice when only the tonsils are involved chronically [^6ef7046c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for related codes that could be mistakenly used. J35.02 denotes chronic adenoiditis alone, J35.03 denotes chronic tonsillitis with adenoiditis, and J35.9 is an unspecified chronic disease of tonsils and adenoids; none of these match the request for chronic tonsillitis alone, so J35.01 remains the correct selection when the documentation specifies chronic tonsillitis without adenoid involvement [^6ef7046c] [^5d64dc3e].

> I should confirm clinical alignment. Observational and epidemiologic studies operationalize chronic tonsillitis using ICD-10-CM J35.01 to identify cases in large databases, which reinforces that J35.01 is the accepted diagnostic code in practice for chronic tonsillitis, including in research contexts examining long-term outcomes and comorbidity patterns [^e20e7cef] [^a9082341].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis is J35.01 [^6ef7046c].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis is **J35.01**. Use **J35.03** if chronic tonsillitis occurs with chronic adenoiditis, and **J35.9** if the chronic tonsillar disease is unspecified. Accurate coding supports appropriate management and billing, and clinicians should document chronicity and any adenoid involvement to ensure correct code selection [^6ef7046c] [^5d64dc3e].

## ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis

The specific ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis is **J35.01**. This code is used to document chronic inflammation of the tonsils, which may present with persistent sore throat, halitosis, or recurrent infections [^6ef7046c].

---

## Related ICD-10-CM codes

Several related ICD-10-CM codes may be relevant depending on the clinical scenario:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| J35.01 | Chronic tonsillitis |
| J35.02 | Chronic adenoiditis |
| J35.03 | Chronic tonsillitis and adenoiditis |
| J35.8 | Other chronic diseases of tonsils and adenoids |
| J35.9 | Chronic disease of tonsils and adenoids, unspecified |

---

These codes allow clinicians to accurately document the specific chronic condition affecting the tonsils and adenoids, which is essential for appropriate treatment planning and billing [^6ef7046c].

---

## Clinical significance of chronic tonsillitis

Chronic tonsillitis is characterized by persistent inflammation of the tonsils, often resulting in recurrent infections, chronic sore throat, halitosis, and difficulty swallowing. It can significantly impact quality of life and may necessitate medical or surgical intervention, such as tonsillectomy, in severe cases [^3de02903] [^aececc20].

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate documentation is essential for correct ICD-10-CM coding. Clinicians should clearly document the following:

- **Chronicity**: Confirm that the condition is chronic rather than acute.
- **Specificity**: Specify whether the chronic tonsillitis is isolated or associated with chronic adenoiditis.
- **Clinical findings**: Document symptoms, physical examination findings, and any complications or comorbidities.

---

## Impact of ICD-10-CM coding on clinical practice

The transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM has significantly increased the granularity and specificity of diagnostic coding. This enhanced specificity allows for more accurate tracking of disease prevalence, improved clinical decision-making, and better alignment of billing with clinical services provided [^439852f4] [^fb8d01f8].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for chronic tonsillitis is **J35.01**. Accurate documentation and coding are essential for effective clinical management, billing, and epidemiological tracking. Clinicians should ensure that they document chronicity, specificity, and clinical findings to support appropriate code selection and patient care [^6ef7046c].

### Chronic tonsillitis and IgA nephropathy: findings from a nationwide Japanese cohort study [^e20e7cef]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Little is known regarding the association between chronic tonsillitis and the onset of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In the present study, we examined the potential relationship between chronic tonsillitis and a subsequent risk of developing IgAN.

Study Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting & Participants

4,311,393 individuals without a history of IgAN identified between January 2005 and May 2022 within a Japanese nationwide epidemiological database, the JMDC Claims Database, representing health claims to over 60 insurers.

Exposure

Comorbid chronic tonsillitis based on diagnosis codes.

Outcome

IgAN occurrence.

Analytical Approach

Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for potential confounding factors was employed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).

Results

Comorbid chronic tonsillitis was identified in 12,842 individuals, constituting 0.3% of the cohort. The cohort had a median age of 44 years (IQR, 36-53), and males accounted for 57.9%, with a follow-up of 1,089 days (IQR, 532-1,797), during which 2,653 cases of IgAN developed. Cumulative incidence curve showed a higher cumulative incidence of IgAN in individuals with chronic tonsillitis compared with their counterparts without this condition. Multivariable cause-specific analysis further demonstrated that individuals with chronic tonsillitis had an elevated risk of developing IgAN, with HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 1.79-4.14).

Limitations

Potential residual confounders, and lack of consideration for ethnic distinctions.

Conclusions

Using a large-scale epidemiological dataset, these findings suggest a relationship between chronic tonsillitis and an elevated risk of IgAN development in the general Japanese population.

Plain-Language Summary

IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most prevalent form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, is associated with unfavorable long-term kidney survival and life expectancy. Despite the substantial implications, the early detection of IgAN still remains challenging due to its commonly asymptomatic clinical presentation. Consequently, the exploration of risk factors assumes a critical research priority. Prior studies have reported the potential role of tonsilitis in the pathogenesis of IgAN. In this study, we assessed whether chronic tonsillitis was associated with the subsequent development of IgAN using a nationwide epidemiological dataset incorporating over 4,000,000 individuals. Within this large-scale cohort, our findings revealed an association between a history of tonsillitis and a greater risk of developing IgAN. These findings should heighten awareness of the potential susceptibility of people with chronic tonsilitis to IgAN.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Extracts from the cochrane library: tonsillectomy for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^791b10fd]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The "Cochrane Corner" is a quarterly section in the Journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to highlight implications for clinical decision making. This installment features a Cochrane Review entitled "Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis," which concludes modest efficacy in children for sore throat days and episodes, with greater benefit for those with more severe illness.

### Impact of respiratory infection and chronic comorbidities on early pediatric antibiotic dispensing in the United States [^11f14b1e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Sample and Data Sources

Data on dispensed antibiotics were obtained from pharmacy claims records aggregated in the IBM MarketScan database. These data represent a convenience sample of 19.1–24.3 million individuals (5.9%–7.6% of the US population) with private medical insurance coverage, which varies based on insurance enrollment by month. Each pharmacy claim includes the fill date; the National Drug Code identifier; a drug class (Supplementary Table 1); and the patient's age, sex, state of residence, and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of residence.

The database also includes outpatient and inpatient claims with a primary diagnosis coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9) or revision 10 (ICD10). We restricted the sample to children continuously enrolled through age 5 who were born between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2013 with continuous representation in both the outpatient and pharmacy claims databases, following previous methods (n = 124 759; Table 1, Supplementary Table 2).

Table 1. 
Summary of the Study Population

Linking Outpatient Diagnoses to Antibiotic Courses

Dispensed antibiotic courses were linked to the most recent outpatient visit within 7 days, following previous methods. If a course was linked with an outpatient claim that listed a respiratory infection in either the first or second diagnosis field, then the course was deemed to be due to a respiratory infection. We restricted to the first 2 diagnosis fields because this was the maximum number of outpatient diagnoses available during the earliest years covered by the database (2008 and 2009). After 2010, up to 4 diagnoses were recorded. A respiratory infection was included in the third or fourth position in just 0.8% of the outpatient visit claims after 2010; of these, 76.7% also had a respiratory infection coded in the first or second position, so we anticipate that the bias introduced by including only the first 2 claims is small.

Respiratory infection diagnoses were identified by mapping ICD codes to Clinical Classification Software (CCS) codes and extracting CCS codes consistent with sinusitis, pneumonia, influenza, tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, otitis media, and other unspecified upper respiratory infections (Supplementary Table 3). Use of CCS codes as an intermediary allowed us to use a common classification system despite the change from ICD9 to ICD10 that occurred during the study period. The list of respiratory infections was drawn from prior analyses on antibiotic prescribing in the United States.

### Epidemiology and comorbidity of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in Poland-a nationwide study [^a9082341]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostic pathways for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) have gradually improved over time. Provider practice has also shifted towards goal-oriented treatment with disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs) that together may have changed the epidemiologic landscape of JIA.

Methods

Public healthcare utilization records from the National Health Fund (NHF) were screened between 2010 and 2022. For individuals aged<16 years, we utilized a narrow JIA case definition combining repeat ICD-10 encoding with DMARDs prescription based on ATC codes.

Results

In 2022, we identified 1,625 incident and 29,758 prevalent JIA cases (<16 years), which corresponds to incidence (IRs) and prevalence rates of 4.30 and 78.80 per 100,000 persons of the general population. For the pediatric population, annual IRs for JIA (<16 years) ranged between 24.0 (95% CI 22.8, 25.2) and 38.7 (95% CI 37.2-40.3) per 100,000. Greater susceptibility among females was also consistently observed with the annual IR ratio ranging between 1.16 and 1.53. The most common concurrent disorders based on medical care services were allergic rhinitis (N=5,200, 17.5%), bronchial asthma (N=3,661, 12.3%) and chronic tonsillitis/pharyngitis (N=3641, 12.2%). Analysis of 214,285 outpatient care visits revealed a median (IQR, range) annual healthcare cost of 37.8€ (35.8-47.4€, 30.3-86.1€) per JIA patient.

Conclusions

This comprehensive, nationwide study provides a contemporary estimate of JIA burden in Poland. Our findings indicate that both the occurrence of new cases and overall burden of JIA in the past ten years align with the lower end of projected figures for our geographical area, especially when compared with Scandinavian nations.

### The effectiveness of frequent antibiotic use in reducing the risk of infection-related hospital admissions: results from two large population-based cohorts [^b61ff800]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 5 
Sensitivity analyses of the IRRs of infection-related hospital admissions in month 3–6 after an antibiotic prescription (CPRD and SAIL)

Comparisons of the clinical codes between patients with lowest and highest histories of antibiotic use showed considerably higher recording of clinical codes indicating infections. The ten clinical codes with highest ORs were recurrent urinary tract infection (OR of 57.88), hidradenitis suppurativa (34.34), myringoplasty (31.55), chronic prostatitis (30.61), history of recurrent tonsillitis (29.67), frontal sinusitis (19.96), tonsillectomy (19.14), recurrent UTI (19.09), recurrent cystitis (16.88) and history of recurrent cystitis (16.49). The false discovery rate-adjusted P values were below 0.05 for all these clinical codes. Among the clinical codes with an OR > 1.5 in the quintile with highest history of antibiotic use compared to lowest quintile, there were no clinical codes describing conditions that can lead to immunosuppression.

### Trends in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media in the United States, 1998-2004 [^d53e8105]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Study Sample: Episodes of Care for Acute Otitis Media

Up to 3 diagnoses were recorded for each visit as free text and then coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Visits with the following diagnoses (ICD-9-CM diagnosis of 381.0 – acute nonsuppurative otitis media, 381.4 – nonsuppurative otitis media, not specified as acute or chronic, 382.0 – acute suppurative otitis media, 382.4 – unspecified suppurative otitis media, or 382.9 – unspecified otitis media) were included. Visits with an alternative diagnosis that could have justified an antibiotic prescription were excluded. These were visits with diagnoses such as acute sinusitis (ICD-9-CM 461), chronic sinusitis (ICD-9-CM 473), acute pharyngitis (ICD-9-CM 462), acute tonsillitis (ICD-9-CM 463), streptococcal sore throat (ICD-9-CM 034.0), or pneumonia (ICD-9-CM 481 – 486). Additionally, visits were recorded as being for an acute or chronic problem. To focus specifically on acute episodes of otitis media, visits coded as a chronic problem were excluded from the study sample.

Covariates

Patient age up to 12 years old (collapsed to < 2 years, ≥ 2 years), sex, race (categories collapsed to white or non-white), and insurance status (categories collapsed to private, Medicare/Medicaid, or other) were recorded for each visit. Provider self-selected specialty (NAMCS) and clinic type (NHAMCS) were coded as pediatrics (includes pediatric clinic), family practice (includes general medical clinic) or otolaryngology (includes surgery clinic). Geographic region was recorded as well. Up to 3 "complaints, symptoms, or other reason(s) for visit" were abstracted as free text and then coded centrally using a standard reason for visit classification (RVC) system. Visits with symptoms of ear pain (RCV code 13551) and fever (RCV code 10100) were identified.

### Appropriateness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing among privately insured US patients: ICD-10-CM based cross sectional study [^66758b49]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Characteristics of antibiotic prescription fills in each category

Among the 1 973 873 appropriate fills, the three most frequently associated diagnoses were urinary tract infections, streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and bacterial pneumonia (table 3). Among the 5 487 003 potentially appropriate fills, the three most frequently associated diagnoses were acute sinusitis, acute suppurative otitis media, and acute pharyngitis. Among the 3 592 183 inappropriate fills, the three most frequently associated diagnoses were acute bronchitis, acute upper respiratory tract infection, and respiratory symptoms such as cough.

Table 3 
Characteristics of antibiotic prescription fills in each category, MarketScan 2016. Values are numbers (percentages)

N/A=not applicable.

Among the 11 053 059 antibiotic fills classified as either appropriate, potentially appropriate, or inappropriate, 8 257 536 (74.7%) were prescribed in office based settings, 866 804 (7.8%) were prescribed in urgent care centers, and 664 639 (6.0%) were prescribed in emergency departments. Among the 3 592 183 inappropriate fills, 2 541 125 (70.7%) were prescribed in office based settings, 222 804 (6.2%) in urgent care centers, and 168 396 (4.7%) in emergency departments.

Among the 4 402 775 antibiotic prescription fills that were not associated with a recent diagnosis code, 747 342 (16.9%) were refills of previous antibiotic prescriptions (table 3). Among these 747 342 refills, the most common antibiotics were doxycycline (218 668, 29.3%), minocycline (139 524, 18.7%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (74 899, 10.0%).

Sensitivity analyses

Results did not change substantially when we used a longer look back period, excluded refills, excluded fills occurring between 1 January 2016 and 3 January 2016, or excluded fills in which the setting was assigned to inpatient visits or outpatient surgeries (see appendices 7-10).

### Tonsillitis [^3de02903]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The definition of severe recurrent throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year; symptoms for at least 1 year; and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cold-steel tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Impact of clinical practice guidelines on pediatric tonsillectomy for tonsillitis [^71307661]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of the release of updated American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNSF) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for Tonsillectomy in Children in 2019 on adherence to evidence-based practice.

Methods

Patients between ages 1 and 18 who had tonsillectomies and encounters for throat infection (tonsillitis or pharyngitis) between of February 5, 2015 and February 4, 2023 were identified by International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes, excluding those with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. Retrospective chart review was performed to determine adherence to evidence-based practice.

Results

There was a significant increase in adherence to evidence-based practice post-CPG release compared to pre-CPG (85.4% vs 73.1%, P=.0088). There was an observed trend for improved adherence to evidence-based practice for pediatric tonsillectomy for recurrent infection for most of the post-CPG period. There were fewer tonsillectomies performed post-CPG, despite more total encounters for throat infection.

Discussion

The publication of the updated AAO-HNSF CPG corresponded with improved adherence to evidence-based practice for tonsillectomy in children for recurrent infection and an observed decrease in overall rate of tonsillectomy. This suggests the CPG may be an effective quality improvement tool for reducing variation and unnecessary patient morbidity or harm.

Implications For Practice

These findings suggest that the updated AAO-HNSF CPG for Tonsillectomy in Children may have effectively impacted practice patterns, and further work should be done to expand their reach to other specialties and settings. Consideration should also be given to further understand any balancing factors associated with reduced tonsillectomies for recurrent infections including quality of life impact on children managed expectantly.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^b8c09dcb]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children—guideline scope and purpose emphasize identifying quality improvement opportunities and creating clear, actionable recommendations for children undergoing tonsillectomy; the target population is any child 1 to 18 years of age who may be a candidate for tonsillectomy, and the guideline does not apply to children excluded from most tonsillectomy studies (neuromuscular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, congenital anomalies of the head and neck region, coagulopathies, or immunodeficiency). The guideline predominantly addresses obstructive and infectious indications, noting that evidence for orthodontic concerns, dysphagia, dysphonia, secondary enuresis, tonsilliths, halitosis, and chronic tonsillitis is limited and generally of lesser quality with a role for shared decision making; although tonsillectomy is strongly indicated for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders or malignancy, these are outside the scope. While partial intracapsular tonsillectomy is frequently performed, the group decided not to include it in this guideline and not to compare tonsillectomy with partial tonsillectomy outcomes, with a separate commentary being prepared. The document is not intended to be a comprehensive general guide but to define useful actions for clinicians and improve quality of care, and its statements are not intended to limit or restrict individualized care.

### Stress-related disorders among young individuals with surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids [^34029d82]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We analyzed any stress-related disorder as well as PTSD, acute stress reaction, and adjustment disorder or other stress reaction. We then focused on any stress-related disorder as the outcome and conducted stratified analyses by sex, age at start of follow-up, time since start of follow-up, parental educational attainment, and parental history of stress-related disorders. We included an interaction term with the exposure and a specific covariate in the model to evaluate whether the association was modified by the covariate. For the exposed persons, we identified from the Patient Register any hospital visit concerning hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids, chronic infection in the tonsils or adenoids, other chronic diseases of the tonsils or adenoids, or sleep-related conditions before the surgery and considered them as potential indications for surgery (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We then conducted separate analyses for surgeries with different potential indications.

We replicated these analyses in the sibling-matched cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression models conditioned on family identifiers, with time since start of follow-up as the underlying timescale and adjustment for sex and age at the start of follow-up. Parental educational attainment and history of stress-related disorders were not adjusted for as they were shared between full siblings. To test the hypothesis that removal of tonsils or adenoids may lead to an increased risk of stress-related disorders through an altered risk of infections, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess risk of hospital-treated infectious diseases, ie, first hospital visit for which an infectious disease was indicated as the primary diagnosis during follow-up based on ICD codes.Finally, to test the hypothesis that temperament or susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in general might be an explanation for the association, we conducted another sensitivity analysis to assess risk of other psychiatric disorders (ICD-8 codes 290-315, ICD-9 codes 290-319, and ICD-10 codes F00-F99, excluding codes for stress-related disorders) following the surgery.

Data management and analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and R, version 3.6.0. A 2-sided P <.05 was considered statistically significant. We did not adjust for multiplicity of statistical tests, as adopting a top-down approach, the main hypothesis of an increased risk of stress-related disorders after surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids, consists of only 1 test.

### Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^75451ff5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation but the indications for surgery are controversial.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tonsillectomy, with and without adenoidectomy, in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), bibliographies, and additional sources were searched for published and unpublished trials. The date of the last search was 11 April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. We included trials which used reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

This review includes five studies: four undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effects of tonsillectomy is only available for children and for effects in the first year following surgery.Children were divided into two subgroups: those who are severely affected (based on specific criteria which are often referred to as the 'Paradise criteria') and those less severely affected.For more severely affected children adeno-/tonsillectomy will avoid three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat, including one episode of moderate or severe sore throat in the next year. The cost of this is a predictable episode of pain in the immediate postoperative period.Less severely affected children may never have had another severe sore throat anyway and the chance of them so doing is modestly reduced by adeno-/tonsillectomy. For them, surgery will mean having an average of two rather than three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat. The cost of this reduction is one inevitable and predictable episode of postoperative pain. The 'average' patient will have 17 rather than 22 sore throat days but some of these 17 days (between five and seven) will be in the immediate postoperative period. Whilst the concept of the 'average' patient is attractive, in practice, wide variability is likely.One reason why the impact of surgery is so modest, is that many untreated patients get better spontaneously. There is a trade-off for the physician and patient who must weigh up a number of different uncertainties: what proportion of my throat symptoms are attributable to my tonsils, and will I get better without any treatment? Similarly, the potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy is effective in reducing the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throats in children, the gain being more marked in those most severely affected. The size of the effect is modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of it.It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.

### Code-based syndromic surveillance for influenzalike illness by international classification of diseases, ninth revision [^07510fe4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The results of this study support previous findings on the ability of automated systems to capture the same trends as traditional surveillance. The Minnesota Department of Health found that an ILI grouping of ICD-9 data from a health maintenance organization in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area correlated with reported deaths from pneumonia and influenza. Ambulatory ICD-9 codes were also successfully used for surveillance of respiratory illnesses in Massachusetts and were highly correlated with hospital admissions that had a lower proportion of discharged patients with a diagnosis of respiratory illness. Our study also supports evidence that using nontraditional electronic data for syndromic surveillance may enable health providers to recognize and detect the influenza season faster than with traditional means. In a similar study of nontraditional data, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported that their syndromic system, based on chief complaints at emergency departments, detected the first citywide signs of influenza activity sooner than laboratory- and sentinel-based surveillance.

We have established that ICD-9–based surveillance that uses the ILI-large and ILI-small groups is an effective tool for influenza surveillance. We suggest that health agencies use these syndrome groups as a model for developing similar systems. However, we strongly emphasize that developers perform critical analysis of the individual codes collected in their data and carefully consider not only the clinical basis for code inclusion but also which diagnoses are more likely to cause background “noise” rather than contribute to the signal. Our own evaluation illustrates the importance of such critical review, as we found that both throat pain and acute tonsillitis had more noise than signal. Asthma and chest pain are included in other syndromic systems ; however, in the DOD data, these tend to occur year-round with fairly high volume and contribute more noise than signal in the DOD ambulatory data. Studies of systems that use such broad categories for ILI surveillance have yielded lower correlation of ICD-9 data with mortality and laboratory-based data. Data sources differ dramatically in population coverage, quality and accuracy, and most important, in their ability to reflect true disease patterns. Our method for defining and assessing syndrome groupings for ICD-9–based surveillance should assist developers in parsing, analyzing, and interpreting their own data.

### Impact of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, on head and neck surgery [^ff5ca8f7]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Review changes in the number of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes utilized in head and neck surgery service and associated changes in cost and charges of health services.

Methods

A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed utilizing the Nationwide Readmissions Database, 2015. The study population included patients who were admitted for a primary head and neck procedure. Patients discharged in the third quarter (Q3), coding system ICD-9-CM, compared to patients discharged in the fourth quarter (Q4), coding system ICD-10-CM.

Results

A total of 11,456 and 10,431 patients discharged in Q3 and Q4, respectively. Comparing the top 90% billed disease codes demonstrated that the number of ICD-10-CM codes was more by a factor of 1.20. However, classifying codes by type of surgery, fewer codes were used in patients who had laryngeal surgeries or tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy by a factor of 0.8. Codes used to document the primary diagnoses for patients who underwent tracheostomy increased the most by a factor of 1.42. Controlling for multiple factors that would affect the cost of health services, there were no significant changes in the cost of management per case (Q3: $70,189.00 ± 1,546.39 vs. Q4: $70,502.00 ± 1,560.17, P = 0.68) or hospital charges (Q3: $273,411.00 ± 7,852.78 vs. Q4: 265,996 ± 7922.77, P = 0.05).

Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM provides an expansion of codes. Initial indication is that utilization of ICD-10-CM codes for head and neck surgery is within expected parameters and appears not to affect the cost of management and hospital charges despite the overall increase in ICD codes in the newer version.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^53ea1028]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 1999 and previously updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of tonsillectomy (with and without adenoidectomy) in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis in reducing the number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults.We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of any severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period.When we analysed only episodes of moderate/severe sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery.Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence).Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence).When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality.Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics.Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion.The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.

### Recurrent throat infections (tonsillitis) [^42ffb13a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, cold steel tonsillectomy, diathermy tonsillectomy.

Diagnosis coding under this system uses a different number of digits and some other changes, but the format is very much the same as ICD-9-CM. The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services has mandated industry-wide adoption of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets by Oct. 1, 2011. ICD-10-CMS will affect all components of the healthcare industry. Ambulatory surgery centers will not be affected by ICD-10-PCS unless they are utilizing ICD-9-CM volume 3 for inpatient procedures. The two major changes in the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM code sets are structure and detail.

The codes will move from a numeric five-character size to an alphanumeric seven-character size. At current count, there are approximately 17, 000 ICD-9-CM codes and the possibility of 155, 000 ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. The codes are far more specific which will allow for greater accuracy.

### Association of chronic and acute inflammation of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue with psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior [^8ac3a36f]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (reference 2013/862-31/5). The requirement for informed consent was waived because the study was register-based and the included individuals were not identifiable at any time.

Data sources

Using the unique Swedish national identification number, we linked several Swedish nationwide health and administrative registers. Demographic and migration data were extracted from the Swedish Total Population Register and the Migration Register, respectively. The kinship was identified from the Multi-Generation Register, and information on the causes and dates of death was collected from the Cause of Death Register. The Prescribed Drug Register (PDR) covered all prescribed and dispensed medications since July 2005. The National Patient Register (NPR) provided information on diagnoses given in both inpatient (from 1969, with nationwide coverage for psychiatric disorders from 1973) and outpatient specialist services (since 2001) in Sweden. These diagnoses are based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in its eighth (ICD-8; 1969–1986), ninth (ICD-9; 1987–1996), and tenth (ICD-10; 1997–2013) revisions.

Study population

We used a longitudinal, population-based, birth cohort design. The cohort consisted of all singleton live births in Sweden from January 1, 1973 through December 31, 2003 with two biological parents identifiable from the Multi-Generation Register. The study population was followed up until December 31, 2013. To control for familial confounding, each individual was linked to their full siblings using the Multi-Generation Register. To link the relatives, a family identification number was created. Siblings were identified within the same birth cohort (i.e. 1973–2003) and were considered for the family level analysis if they had at least one full sibling discordant for the exposure in question, separately for tonsillectomies and acute appendicitis.

### Pediatric patient and hospital characteristics associated with treatment of peritonsillar abscess and peritonsillar cellulitis [^d674aedf]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with the choice of treatment for pediatric patients who present in the acute setting with peritonsillar abscess/cellulitis (PTA/PTC).

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study was performed using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project emergency department, ambulatory, and inpatient state databases for the years 2010 and 2011. Children aged 0 to 17 years were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code for PTA/PTC. The main outcome of interest was treatment received, which included medical therapy alone, incision and drainage (IND) or tonsillectomy. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to model non-clinical factors associated with treatment received after adjusting for age, hospital state, race, primary expected payer, existing chronic condition(s), and type of hospital.

Results

We identified 2994 patients who presented with PTA/PTC. The most common treatment choice was medical therapy alone (30.8%), followed by IND (30.5%) and tonsillectomy (9.4%). There were significant associations between treatment choice and race, primary payer status, and type of hospital (P < .05). We found that Hispanic patients, those with Medicaid as their primary expected payer, and those treated at a designated children's hospital were 3 nonclinical factors independently associated with an increase in likelihood of receiving tonsillectomy as treatment.

Conclusion

There are important nonclinical factors associated with treatment of children who present in the acute setting with PTA/PTC. Additional research is recommended to understand these observed differences in care and how they may affect health outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^8f064301]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

PANDAS and poorly validated indications—“Tonsillectomy has been considered for treating pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), but evidence is anecdotal and the etiology poorly understood,” and “A recent systematic review found no recommendations either for or against performing tonsillectomy specifically to treat PANDAS.” Poorly validated indications listed include “chronic tonsillitis, febrile seizures, muffled (“hot potato”) speech, halitosis, malocclusion of teeth, tonsillar hypertrophy, cryptic tonsils, and chronic pharyngeal carriage of GABHS,” and “There is a substantial role for shared decision making with caregivers when considering tonsillectomy for ≥1 of these conditions.”

Efficacy and effectiveness of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection show short-term benefits that diminish over time. Evidence “suggest[s] a modest but statistically significant reduction in frequency of throat infection among severely affected patients undergoing tonsillectomy for 1 year but no longer.” In a trial meeting strict episode criteria, “the tonsillectomy group experienced a mean rate reduction of 1.9 episodes per year in the first year of follow-up,” whereas controls had “a mean rate reduction of 0.5 to 1 episodes per year.” For moderate or severe episodes, controls had “1.2 episodes in the first year versus 0.1 in the surgical group.”

*NOS, not otherwise specified; NEC, not elsewhere classified (as listed in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision). ‡ Department of Defense–wide outpatient visit data, October 2000–December 2004.

For the unmatched DOD-wide analysis, we found 15,914 samples taken during the study period, of which 6,340 (39.8%) were positive for any viral respiratory pathogen, and 2,210 (13.9%) were positive for influenza A or B. Temporal analysis showed that as a group, the original ILI syndrome follows the same seasonal pattern as that for positive specimens. Individual ICD-9 code trends for influenza, fever, unspecified viral infection, otitis media, and upper respiratory infection (multiple sites) correlated well with those of the positive specimens (Tables 3, 4). Codes that did not correlate with positive specimen trends included acute tonsillitis and throat pain.

Many individual codes that correlated well with the positive specimens also tended to have high signal-to-noise ratios (Table 5). Moreover, the percentage of positive specimens associated with many of these codes also tended to be high. Based on the results of these 3 tests and their individual trends, we selected 14 ICD-9 codes for ILI surveillance. We used the frequency of individual code use during the 4-year analysis period to group 10 of the 14 codes into the ILI-large group and the other 4 into the ILI-small group, as indicated in Tables 4 and 5.

Lagged correlation analysis found that the codes of both subsets tend to peak at the same time as the number of positive specimens (Figure 1). However, the ILI-Small group codes, while still peaking centrally, tended to have curves slightly skewed to the right in the lagged correlation plot, indicating that they may be more likely to follow, rather than predict, the increases in ILI visits.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^ee9800f8]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-center before-and-after cohort study. Participants were recruited from the Mikkeli Central Hospital pediatric emergency department. This pediatric emergency department is a 24/7 primary and secondary level emergency care unit that provides on-call general practitioner, pediatrician, and ENT specialist consultation services.

We included all pediatric patients (0–15 years) with an ICD-10 diagnostic code of J02* (pharyngitis) or J03* (tonsillitis) who attended the emergency department between July 2019 and June 2022. The study periods were prior to the publication of the latest national guidelines (July 2019 to June 2020) and after (July 2020 to June 2022). We calculated that 200 patients before and 200 patients after the update to the Finnish Current Care Guidelines would be a sufficient sample to represent changes in the diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis. Since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the circulation of respiratory pathogens in children in 2020 and 2021, we collected data for two years after the update to achieve the desired number of patients. Only primary visits were included.

We extracted the following information for every patient and visit: date, age, sex, previously diagnosed long-term illnesses, fever (measured or anamnestic), complaint of sore throat, complaint of cough, tonsillar status, swollen or sore cervical lymph nodes, Centor score, and rapid antigen, throat culture, and CRP test results (if taken). We calculated Centor scores based on the symptoms reported in the patient records and compared them and the number of rapid antigen tests taken in the before and after groups.

Our main outcomes were the use of Centor scores and laboratory tests (i.e. CRP and microbiological testing for GAS) in pediatric patients with pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

Statistics

We determined that it would be clinically significant if the publication of the Current Care Guidelines increased the use of Centor criteria in assessing the need for microbiological samples from 10 to 25%. We calculated that with a type I error of 5% and a type II error of 10%, we would need 147 patients before and 147 patients after the publication of the guideline to demonstrate this 15% absolute difference. Since complete information is not available in all patients’ medical records, we included 200 patients before and 200 patients after the publication of the new guidelines.

We compared the rates before and after the guideline publication by calculating their difference in proportions and the 95% confidence interval for it.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis identification in administrative databases and health surveys: a systematic review [^d874a886]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Much of the epidemiological data on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are based on large administrative databases and health surveys. The accuracy of CRS identification with these methods is unknown.

Methods

A systematic review was performed to identify studies that measured the accuracy of CRS diagnoses in large administrative databases or within health surveys. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess study quality.

Results

Of 512 abstracts initially identified, 122 were selected for full-text review; only three studies (2.5%) measured the accuracy of CRS patient identification. In a single, large administrative database study with a CRS prevalence of 54.8%, a single International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision diagnostic code for CRS had a positive predictive value (PPV) of only 34%. A diagnostic code algorithm identified CRS patients with a PPV of 91.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3-95.1); in a population with a CRS prevalence of 5%, this algorithm had a PPV of 31%. In health survey studies having an estimated CRS prevalence of 25% to 46%, self-reported symptom-based CRS diagnosis had a PPV of 62% (95% CI, 50.2-72.1) when nasal endoscopy was the gold standard for CRS diagnosis, and 70% (95% CI, 57.4-80.8) when otolaryngologist-based CRS diagnosis (after interview and nasal endoscopy) was the gold standard.

Conclusion

Most health administrative data and health surveys examining CRS did not consider the accuracy of case identification. For unselected populations, administrative data and health surveys using self-reported diagnoses inaccurately identify patients with CRS. Epidemiological results based on such data should be interpreted with these results in mind. Laryngoscope, 126:1303-1310, 2016.

### Plain language summary for patients: tonsillectomy in children [^d2adaf80]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

This plain language summary for patients serves as an overview explaining tonsillectomy in children and to help patients, caregivers, and clinicians in their discussions about the reasons that a tonsillectomy may be needed, management options, and care related to the procedure. This summary applies to patients ages 1 through 18 years and is based on the 2019 "Clinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children (Update)." This evidence-based guideline mainly addresses the need for tonsillectomy based on breathing problems that take place during sleep and repeated sore throats or "tonsillitis." The guideline was developed to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create clear recommendations for clinicians to use in medical practice.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box).The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions.The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Comorbidity landscape of the Danish patient population affected by chromosome abnormalities [^c9501fef]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Most chromosome abnormality patients were diagnosed with DS, KS, or TS and, as expected, most comorbidities were identified for these. In total, 17 direct comorbidities were shared between DS, KS, and TS, and numerous comorbidities were shared pairwise between the three (Fig. 2a). No inverse comorbidity was shared between DS, KS, and TS, only six inverse comorbidities overlapped between DS and TS (Fig. 2b). In total, 56 inverse comorbidities were identified for DS, only “Chronic disease of tonsils and adenoids” (J35) (RR = 0.46) was observed as inverse comorbidity for KS, and nine inverse comorbidities were identified for TS (Table 1 and Table S2). Please see Text S1 for an elaborate presentation on the shared direct and inverse comorbidities of DS, KS, and TS.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^63aa6243]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

History <12 months and observation before tonsillectomy: There are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of tonsillectomy for patients experiencing recurrent tonsillitis over a period <12 months, and all required a minimum number of sore throats in the preceding 12 months; for example, in the study by Paradise et al, 62 (33%) of the 187 children who satisfied the Paradise criteria had ≥7 throat infections in the preceding 12 months. Because of this tendency to improve with time, at least a 12-month period of observation is recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention, but this statement should not restrict access to tonsillectomy prior to 1 year of observation when patients may reasonably be considered in circumstances including complications of infection, such as ≥2 peritonsillar abscesses.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Hospital-treated infectious diseases and the risk of dementia: a large, multicohort, observational study with a replication cohort [^9e9c5b61]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Exposure to hospital-treated infectious diseases

We linked participants of the primary cohort to the Care Register for Health Care (Finland). Participants of the replication cohort were linked to hospital admission data from Hospital Episode Statistics–Admitted Patient Care (England), Scottish Morbidity Records–General/Acute Inpatient and Day Case Admissions (Scotland), and Patient Episode Database for Wales. We retrieved primary and secondary diagnoses of infectious disease from inpatient hospital discharge information from these registries using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Diagnostic codes for the 8th and 9th revisions (ICD-8 and ICD-9) were converted into ICD-10 codes.

For the primary analysis, we classified hospital-treated infectious diseases hierarchically to reflect the type of pathogen and severity of infection (figure 1). Level 1 includes all infectious diseases—ie, a total of 925 ICD-10 codes—except for mild upper respiratory tract infections. At level 2, infectious diseases are divided into bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal infections. In level 3, we further classified bacterial infections to reflect properties of the infection and pathogen: disease invasiveness and severity ([potentially] invasive vs [mostly] localised, and with sepsis vs without sepsis); bacterial location and related adaptive immune responses (extracellular vs obligate or facultative intracellular [extracellular bacteria tend to trigger type 17 T-helper responses, intracellular bacteria and viruses tend to trigger type 1 T-helper responses]);and cell wall structure (Gram-positive vs Gram-negative bacteria vs mycobacteria vs mycoplasma [lipopolysaccharides produced by Gram-negative bacteria strongly stimulate the immune system]).Classifications of bacterial location and cell wall structure were based only on ICD-10 codes that defined the causative microorganism unambiguously (eg, shigellosis, legionnaires disease, pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae). Examples of invasive bacterial infections included appendicitis, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis; and localised bacterial infections included gastroenteritis, tonsillitis, and cystitis. We also classified viral infections into acute infections typically eradicated by the immune system, herpes virus infections that persist in the body after primary infection, and other persistent viral infections such as HIV. Mycobacterial, mycoplasma, parasitic, and fungal infections were too rare to be analysed separately, but they were included in the analyses of the broader categories of infections to which they belonged.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^d7d7f52e]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent sore throat outcomes and Paradise criteria: While tonsillectomy can reduce the recurrence rate of sore throat, missed school days, and health care utilization, this effect does not extend beyond the first year postoperatively, and benefits are significantly lessened for children with a mild disease burden; as a result, tonsillectomy is not cost-effective and does not provide clinically meaningful improvements in children who do not meet the “Paradise criteria” (7 episodes in the past year, 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years).

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^cabc3691]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to this study. The cohorts were predominantly male, white, and of middle to older age which may limit generalizability since RA is a female predominant condition. However, the RDCI was previously found to perform similarly for predicting mortality and functional status in VA and non-VA cohorts. The ICD-9-CM cohort was defined during the end of the ICD-9-CM era when clinicians may be more experienced with diagnostic code selection, compared with the ICD-10-CM cohort which was during the early period of the ICD-10-CM era. To reduce misclassification resulting from this, we excluded the initial three-month time period after ICD-10-CM implementation. Patients may have received care outside the VA, which could underestimate the prevalence of individual conditions and RDCI scores, though we do not expect this to differ by ICD era. Finally, we evaluated the predictive ability for mortality and functional status but recognize comorbidity burden is also associated with other long-term outcomes such as quality of life, which were not available.

In conclusion, we generated a set of ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI that produce comparable RDCI scores and chronic disease prevalence estimates to those derived from previously validated ICD-9-CM codes. RDCI scores calculated using these ICD-10-CM codes are highly predictive of functional status and mortality, comparing favorably to scores based on ICD-9-CM codes. The proposed RDCI codes can be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research spanning the ICD-10-CM era.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold.Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups.,,,, This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Code-based syndromic surveillance for influenzalike illness by international classification of diseases, ninth revision [^33a6bbc6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Results

During the study period, 7,389 Air Force specimens were taken for the matched analysis. We found an ICD-9–coded visit within the 5-day window surrounding the sample collection date for 6,236 (84.4%), with most of those specimens matching on the exact day (5,267, 84.5%). Of the 6,236 specimens with a match, 339 patients (5.4%) had >1 visit recorded: 321 had 2 visits, 12 had 3 visits, and 1 patient had 4 visits for the same day. Tables 2 and 3 show a breakdown of how the match worked, including multiple visits and multiple ICD-9 codes per visit. We gave preference to the highest order diagnosis for 68 patients who had multiple ILI diagnoses. For the 96 patients who had multiple visits without an ILI code, we selected the closest diagnosis to an infectious disease or 1 depicting respiratory symptoms.

Tables 4 and 5 show the number of specimens associated with each ICD-9 code, as well as the percentage of those specimens that tested positive for any viral respiratory pathogen and for influenza virus. We found many of the ILI codes to either be infrequently used with a viral specimen or to have a low percentage of positive specimens. Four codes not in the original ILI group (otitis media, acute suppurative otitis media, acute sinusitis, and acute tonsillitis) were frequently used with the collection of viral specimens.

### Reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in upper respiratory tract infection in a primary care setting in kolkata, India [^8c4b5e2b]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

PDSA cycle 2

The aim of this cycle was to further reduce antibiotic prescribing by discussing alternative management strategies, by giving clear guidelines on when antibiotics were indicated and by encouraging a greater focus on diagnosis through updating the coding system.

The interventions outlined in the first PDSA cycle continued. Training focused on strategies to limit antibiotic prescribing built around the motivations elicited previously. For example: the use of safety netting to ensure patients are reviewed if they deteriorate; the use of examination to exclude serious bacterial infection such as pneumonia; testing for dengue and malaria in febrile patients with URTI symptoms; patient education on self-care and the risks of inappropriate antibiotic use in self-limiting conditions; and identifying and addressing the patient’s expectations.

The organisation did not have antimicrobial guidelines. Guidelines were developed based on national and international recommendations and evidence, adapted to local availability of drugs. Unfortunately, local resistance data were unavailable, and therefore, national resistance data were used to inform the guidelines. Guidelines were circulated to the medical management team and frontline staff for their input before finalisation.

The coding system previously had a single code for URTI. The hypothesis was that changing the coding to an umbrella code of URTI with specific subsections (common cold, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis and other/non-specific URTI) would encourage more targeted prescribing and thus reduce indiscriminate use of antibiotics. The implementation of the coding change took longer than anticipated, as the entire coding system was updated in the process, and changes needed to be agreed by all key parties. The new coding system was implemented on April 2017.

In the audit following this PDSA cycle, antibiotic use dropped dramatically to 7.8%.

### A method for reporting and classifying acute infectious diseases in a prospective study of young children: TEDDY [^2200471b]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This study has its limitations. Parental reporting of infectious diseases captures only symptomatic infections, which is generally considered to represent only a fraction of all microbial exposures. Reporting of infections can also be prone to variation between families due to varying level of study compliance and vigilance in noticing symptoms. Another possible limitation is the pedantry of ICD-10 coding system, which can lead to variation in translation of parental reports into ICD-10 codes, especially if countries have different national guidelines and conventions in using ICD-10 codes. Possible variations in the use of ICD-10 codes can be overcome by using the infectious episode approach developed in this study, as in this mode of analysis same sort of infections fall under same category even if the infections would have been recorded using slightly different ICD-10 codes. We also noticed, that it was sometimes difficult for the research nurses to differentiate between ICD-10 codes for acute and chronic infections, since some ICD-10 codes for chronic infections had been entered into the database as acute illnesses. The total number of chronic infections misclassified as acute infections in the database was low (n = 116) by chronic middle ear infections accounting for most (n = 97, detailed data not shown).

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^ab649d8f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 3—strength of action terms in guideline statements and implied levels of obligation specifies that 'Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present,' 'Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences,' and 'Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.' It defines 'Strong recommendation' as 'A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, in the case of a strong negative recommendation, that the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high (grade A or B),' 'Recommendation' as 'A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms (or, in the case of a negative recommendation, that the harms exceed the benefits), but the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C),' and 'Option' as 'An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D)a or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C)a show little clear advantage to one approach versus another,' and notes 'Option resembles the “Weak Recommendation” utilized in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification system.'

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^c5dddfcc]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in children—evidence profile and policy level—is supported by “Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B …; some Grade C observational studies,” with “Level of confidence in evidence: Medium.” Benefits note that “Patients who proceed with the option of tonsillectomy will achieve a modest reduction in the frequency and severity of recurrent throat infection for 1 year after surgery and a modest reduction in frequency of group A streptococcal infection for 1 year after surgery,” while “Risks, harms, costs” include surgical morbidity and direct and indirect costs. The “Benefits-harm assessment” is a “Balance between benefit and harm,” “Role of patient preferences” is “Large role for shared decision making,” and the “Policy level: Option.” The group held “near consensus” but “1 member … felt that tonsillectomy should not be recommended,” with some preferring to list both tonsillectomy and watchful waiting as options.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^3211d9b6]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

CLD is safe and results in reduced length of stay for patients with acute pathology requiring an inpatient hospital admission for medical treatment. The majority of patients admitted with acute tonsillitis were eligible for CLD with only a minority requiring ongoing input from medical staff. The bundling of medications together in condition-specific protocols results in high compliance with local guidelines. This project adds to the evidence base for extending CLD to acute admissions.

Cancellation of planned surgery impacts substantially on patients’ health and the NHS’ capacity to provide elective procedures. The risk of a planned operation in the NHS being cancelled on the day of surgery is around 13.9%. Additionally, studies have shown that 31% of on the day cancellations are due to a lack of available inpatient beds.Reducing length of stay and bringing time of discharge forward through CLD increases bed availability for elective patents. Discharging patients prior to midday allows hospital bed managers and surgeons to identify beds for patients to occupy postoperatively. This prevents procedures being cancelled but also prevents operating lists being put on hold while beds are found. Delays is starting operating lists while beds are identified reduces available operating theatre capacity, currently responsible for 12.7% of cancellations.

Abstract

Tonsillitis is a very common condition. It is usually of viral origin, is self-limiting, is generally treated conservatively in practice. Complications can be divided into non-suppurative and suppurative. According to the literature search, there is no reported case of posterior plica perforation caused by recurrent tonsil infections. The authors aimed to present the first case of posterior plica perforation caused by recurrent tonsillitis in the literature.

### Stress-related disorders among young individuals with surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids [^e954c6e1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Tonsillectomy is a widely performed surgical procedure, often for recurrent tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and obstructive sleep-disordered breathing among children and for obstructive sleep apnea and suspicion for a malignant neoplasm among adults.In the US, nearly 300 000 children undergo this procedure annually.In Sweden, approximately 13 500 individuals undergo tonsillectomy annually.Given its high prevalence, especially in early life, it is important to understand the long-term health outcomes of children undergoing tonsillectomy. Individuals who have undergone tonsillectomy have been found to have an increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome; autoimmune,respiratory, allergic, and infectious diseases; premature myocardial infarction; and some cancer types.Several reasons might underlie such findings. First, indications of tonsillectomy, eg, repeated or persistent pharyngeal infections and resultant inflammation, might lead to an altered risk of later health outcomes. Second, the removal of tonsils leads to physiologic changes that might be of relevance to future disease risk. For example, removal of the tonsils eliminates the first-line defense against ingested and inhaled pathogens and may lead to altered immune responses and subsequent disease risk.Finally, there may be common causes for both a need for tonsillectomy in early life and an increased risk of adverse health outcomes later in life, ie, confounding bias.

Psychiatric disorders are among the most common causes of morbidity todayand typically emerge in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood.A previous study found an increased risk of multiple psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior among individuals with tonsillectomy and hypothesized that chronic inflammation within the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue may be an underlying mechanism.Although relatively little is known regarding the intersection between health conditions of the head and neck and psychiatric disorders, or the potential role of chronic inflammation in such an intersection, studies have shown that individuals with chronic inflammatory conditions of the head and neck, including rhinosinusitis and otitis media, may have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. A few smaller studies have also suggested an increased risk of psychiatric disorders or symptoms among children with tonsillectomy, hypothesizing that indications of tonsillectomy and presurgery temperament might be some of the potential explanations.,

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^c3dba18f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy—recurrent throat infection in children requires specified episode frequency plus qualifying clinical features, treatment, and documentation. Minimum frequency is Seven or more episodes in the preceding year, OR Five or more episodes in each of the preceding 2 y, OR Three or more episodes in each of the preceding 3 y. Clinical features that qualify an episode are Temperature >38.3°C (>101°F), Cervical lymphadenopathy (tender lymph nodes or >2 cm), Tonsillar exudate, or Positive culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and sore throat plus the presence of ≥1 qualifies as a counting episode. Treatment requires that antibiotics had been administered in conventional dosage for proved or suspected streptococcal episodes. Documentation requires contemporaneous clinical record for each episode OR, if not fully documented, subsequent observance by the clinician of 2 episodes with consistent patterns; children who meet all other criteria may nonetheless qualify if the same pattern is observed and documented by the clinician in 2 subsequent episodes, and a 12-month period of observation is usually recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention.

### Association between antibiotic prescriptions for acute upper respiratory infections and pneumonia among older adults: a nationwide cohort study [^611b148a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources

This retrospective study used National Health Insurance claims data collected by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, a government agency responsible for reviewing healthcare services in the Republic of Korea. Data were collected from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 to avoid confounding effects from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Of the 93,626,474 claims related to acute URIs, 10,629,051 claims were identified for those aged ≥ 65 years. Patients with multiple visits during a defined period were grouped as a single prescription unit; based on this criterion, we analyzed 5,898,239 prescription units (Fig. 1). The selected claims were categorized by the type of medical institution: primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Fig. 1 
Prescription categorization Prescriptions for individuals aged ≥ 65 years with an acute upper respiratory infection were extracted from claims statements

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (protocol code: 2022-027-001, April 21, 2022).

Diagnostic categories

We selected diseases classified as acute URIs according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The analyzed conditions included acute nasopharyngitis (common cold) (J00), acute sinusitis (J01), acute pharyngitis (J02), acute tonsillitis (J03), acute laryngitis and tracheitis (J04), acute obstructive laryngitis and epiglottitis (J05), and acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites (J06). These were reported as the main diagnoses and the first through the fourth sub-diagnoses.

Prescription units

Each patient’s multiple healthcare visits for an acute URI were grouped into a single prescription unit, defined as a 30-day episode starting from the initial acute URI diagnosis date. All medical claims, diagnoses, and prescriptions occurring within this 30-day window were included as part of the same episode. Antibiotic prescription status was identified within each episode, and pneumonia diagnoses were assessed across the full study period of 2018. This approach allowed us to evaluate whether pneumonia was more commonly diagnosed during the year in patients who had received antibiotics during acute URI episodes, without assuming a temporal or causal sequence.

### Variability in the diagnosis and treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis by primary care pediatricians [^ca7e0f51]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare practice patterns regarding the diagnosis and management of streptococcal pharyngitis across pediatric primary care practices.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

All encounters to 25 pediatric primary care practices sharing an electronic health record.

Methods

Streptococcal pharyngitis was defined by an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for acute pharyngitis, positive laboratory test, antibiotic prescription, and absence of an alternative bacterial infection. Logistic regression models standardizing for patient-level characteristics were used to compare diagnosis, testing, and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for children with pharyngitis across practices. Fixed-effects models and likelihood ratio tests were conducted to analyze within-practice variation.

Results

Of 399,793 acute encounters in 1 calendar year, there were 52,658 diagnoses of acute pharyngitis, including 12,445 diagnoses of streptococcal pharyngitis. After excluding encounters by patients with chronic conditions and standardizing for age, sex, insurance type, and race, there was significant variability across and within practices in the diagnosis and testing for streptococcal pharyngitis. Excluding patients with antibiotic allergies or prior antibiotic use, off-guideline antibiotic prescribing for confirmed group A streptococcal pharyngitis ranged from 1% to 33% across practices (P < .001). At the clinician level, 13 of 25 sites demonstrated significant within-practice variability in off-guideline antibiotic prescribing (P ≤ .05). Only 18 of the 222 clinicians in the network accounted for half of all off-guideline antibiotic prescribing.

Conclusions

Significant variability in the diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis exists across and within pediatric practices, which cannot be explained by relevant clinical or demographic factors. Our data support clinician-targeted interventions to improve adherence to prescribing guidelines for this common condition.

### Association of long-term risk of respiratory, allergic, and infectious diseases with removal of adenoids and tonsils in childhood [^16e03666]. JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils to treat obstructed breathing or recurrent middle-ear infections remain common pediatric procedures; however, little is known about their long-term health consequences despite the fact that these lymphatic organs play important roles in the development and function of the immune system.

Objective

To estimate long-term disease risks associated with adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenotonsillectomy in childhood.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A population-based cohort study of up to 1 189 061 children born in Denmark between 1979 and 1999 and evaluated in linked national registers up to 2009, covering at least the first 10 and up to 30 years of their life, was carried out. Participants in the case and control groups were selected such that their health did not differ significantly prior to surgery.

Exposures

Participants were classified as exposed if adenoids or tonsils were removed within the first 9 years of life.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The incidence of disease (defined by International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision [ICD-8] and Tenth Revision [ICD-10] diagnoses) up to age 30 years was examined using stratified Cox proportional hazard regressions that adjusted for 18 covariates, including parental disease history, pregnancy complications, birth weight, Apgar score, sex, socioeconomic markers, and region of Denmark born.

Results

A total of up to 1 189 061 children were included in this study (48% female); 17 460 underwent adenoidectomy, 11 830 tonsillectomy, and 31 377 adenotonsillectomy; 1 157 684 were in the control group. Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in diseases of the upper respiratory tract (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.51-2.63 and RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.54-4.80; respectively). Smaller increases in risks for infectious and allergic diseases were also found: adenotonsillectomy was associated with a 17% increased risk of infectious diseases (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10-1.25) corresponding to an absolute risk increase of 2.14% because these diseases are relatively common (12%) in the population. In contrast, the long-term risks for conditions that these surgeries aim to treat often did not differ significantly and were sometimes lower or higher.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study of almost 1.2 million children, of whom 17 460 had adenoidectomy, 11 830 tonsillectomy, and 31 377 adenotonsillectomy, surgeries were associated with increased long-term risks of respiratory, infectious, and allergic diseases. Although rigorous controls for confounding were used where such data were available, it is possible these effects could not be fully accounted for. Our results suggest it is important to consider long-term risks when making decisions to perform tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.

### Stress-related disorders among young individuals with surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids [^3ec8c6cc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcome

A first diagnosis of stress-related disorder during follow-up was identified from the Patient Register. Although coverage for all inpatient care was nationwide starting in 1987, the register covers inpatient care for psychiatric disorders since 1973. During the follow-up, we obtained complete information on inpatient-based diagnoses of stress-related disorders until 2000 and on both inpatient- and outpatient-based diagnoses from 2001 onward. We identified any stress-related disorder using International Classification of Diseases, Revision 8 (ICD-8) codes 307 and 308.4; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 308 and 309; and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code F43. We also studied PTSD (ICD-9 code 309B, ICD-10 code F43.1), acute stress reaction (ICD-9 codes 308 and 309A, ICD-10 code F43.0), and adjustment disorder or other stress reaction (ICD-9 code 309X, ICD-10 codes F43.2, F43.8, and F43.9) separately. As the subtypes were only possible to differentiate in ICD-9 and ICD-10, this analysis was conducted from 1987 onward. Diagnostic codes within the Patient Register have a positive predicted value of 85% to 95% for most common diseasesand 75% to 90% for PTSD.

Covariates

We used age, sex, calendar period, parental educational attainment (as a proxy for early-life socioeconomic status), and parental history of stress-related disorders (as a proxy for genetic predisposition to stress-related disorders) as covariates. We identified the parents of the study participants through the Multi-Generation Register and linked them to the Swedish Longitudinal Integrated Database for Health Insurance and Labor (LISA) to obtain information on the highest parental educational attainment. Since 1990, LISA has collected annually updated data on demographic and socioeconomic status for individuals aged 16 years or older in Sweden. We also linked the parents to the Patient Register to identify history of stress-related disorders.

### Association of patient characteristics with postoperative mortality in children undergoing tonsillectomy in 5 US States [^0c8688e0]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The rate of postoperative death in children undergoing tonsillectomy is uncertain. Mortality rates are not separately available for children at increased risk of complications, including young children (aged <3 y) and those with sleep-disordered breathing or complex chronic conditions.

Objective

To estimate postoperative mortality following tonsillectomy in US children, both overall and in relation to recognized risk factors for complications.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study based on longitudinal analysis of linked records in state ambulatory surgery, inpatient, and emergency department discharge data sets distributed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 5 states covering 2005 to 2017. Participants included 504 262 persons younger than 21 years for whom discharge records were available to link outpatient or inpatient tonsillectomy with at least 90 days of follow-up.

Exposures

Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy.

Main Outcome and Measures

Postoperative death within 30 days or during a surgical stay lasting more than 30 days. Modified Poisson regression with sample weighting was used to estimate postoperative mortality per 100 000 operations, both overall and in relation to age group, sleep-disordered breathing, and complex chronic conditions.

Results

The 504 262 children in the cohort underwent a total of 505 182 tonsillectomies (median [IQR] patient age, 7 [4-12] years; 50.6% females), of which 10.1% were performed in young children, 28.9% in those with sleep-disordered breathing, and 2.8% in those with complex chronic conditions. There were 36 linked postoperative deaths, which occurred a median (IQR) of 4.5 (2-20.5) days after surgical admission, and most of which (19/36 [53%]) occurred after surgical discharge. The unadjusted mortality rate was 7.04 (95% CI, 4.97-9.98) deaths per 100 000 operations. In multivariable models, neither age younger than 3 years nor sleep-disordered breathing was significantly associated with mortality, but children with complex chronic conditions had significantly higher mortality (16 deaths/14 299 operations) than children without these conditions (20 deaths/490 883 operations) (117.22 vs 3.87 deaths per 100 000 operations; adjusted rate difference, 113.55 [95% CI, 51.45-175.64] deaths per 100 000 operations; adjusted rate ratio, 29.39 [95% CI, 13.37-64.62]). Children with complex chronic conditions accounted for 2.8% of tonsillectomies but 44% of postoperative deaths. Most deaths associated with complex chronic conditions occurred in children with neurologic/neuromuscular or congenital/genetic disorders.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children undergoing tonsillectomy, the rate of postoperative death was 7 per 100 000 operations overall and 117 per 100 000 operations among children with complex chronic conditions. These findings may inform decision-making for pediatric tonsillectomy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^25fcd73f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection—watchful waiting implementation stresses monitoring and documentation to assess impact. The purpose of this statement is to avoid unnecessary intervention in children with recurrent throat infection who have a favorable natural history and are likely to improve without tonsillectomy. Watchful waiting does not imply inaction. Rather, patients should be closely monitored by regular clinic visits and episodes of pharyngotonsillitis accurately documented. Throat infections are treated most often by the primary care provider, but other clinicians may be involved (eg, health care providers at emergency departments or urgent care centers). The primary care provider should collate documentation of all such visits. The clinical characteristics of each episode should be recorded, including the symptoms, physical findings, rapid antigen detection testing, and/or culture results if performed, as well as days of school absence and any quality of life (QoL) issues. Only with this information can the clinician assess the significance of the impact of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis for the patient and caregiver.

### A systematic framework for prioritizing burden of disease data required for vaccine development and implementation: the case for group A streptococcal diseases [^c48772f5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Policy review often assesses the impact of vaccination on all-cause disease syndromes (eg, all-cause pharyngitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, or sepsis). Due to the mild–moderate symptomatology of Strep A pharyngitis, estimates of disease incidence should include community surveillance data and data from primary care, healthcare clinics, and emergency departments to enable policy decisions within the health sector. While impetigo is generally seen as an issue requiring primary care and also requires community surveillance, a high hospitalization burden in First Nations populations (eg, Australia) has been noted using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), coded skin infections. These data will prove useful for post-licensure population studies evaluating disease trends pre- and post-vaccine introduction. Given increasing global concerns of AMR, the use of burden of disease data to measure vaccine impact on AMR and estimate reductions in antibiotic use is an additional important requirement for the policy objective.

Cost-of-illness data are essential for financing decisions. However, the drivers of costs differ across acute Strep A endpoints and different socioeconomic settings. For pharyngitis, the associated consequences of increasing AMR and parental productivity losses are likely key drivers for the value of vaccination; the importance of population AMR trends is recognized by WHO’s vaccine roadmap. It was recently estimated that 17% of antibiotic prescriptions for pharyngitis among US children could be prevented by a Strep A vaccine. For invasive Strep A, the drivers of burden are more likely to be hospitalizations and mortality; hence, data requirements need to be targeted to address these.

### Indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy [^efaf60b5]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review recent clinical trials that provide a foundation on which clinicians can base decisions regarding adenotonsillar surgery for their patients.

Study Design

Review.

Methods

An evidence-based approach was used to review recent clinical trials addressing indications for adenotonsillectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy.

Results

Absolute indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy include adenotonsillar hyperplasia with obstructive sleep apnea, failure to thrive, or abnormal dentofacial growth; suspicion of malignant disease; and (for tonsillectomy) hemorrhagic tonsillitis. Relative indications for both procedures are adenotonsillar hyperplasia with upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, or speech impairment, and halitosis. Otitis media and recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis or adenoiditis are relative indications for adenoidectomy but not tonsillectomy. Recurrent or chronic pharyngotonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and streptococcal carriage are relative indications for tonsillectomy but not adenoidectomy.

Conclusion

Good clinical evidence regarding indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is available. Clinicians should make recommendations for surgery on the basis of this evidence.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^21780b3b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Recurrent throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate always must be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^b481435a]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children—recurrent throat infection management: Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥1 of the following: temperature >38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in Key Action Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to: multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^8b4963d9]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children—evidence-based statement categories define three levels with corresponding implied obligations: Strong recommendation—A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation—A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as high, and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option—An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^8dd5df1b]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Defining and documenting throat infection for tonsillectomy candidacy emphasizes accurate episode tracking and required sore throat symptoms. Clinicians are told it is “incumbent … to accurately describe individual episodes of throat infection and to document the frequency of these events,” with “Supportive documentation … [including] absences from school, spread of infection within the family, and a family history of rheumatic heart disease or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.” “The presence of sore throat was a necessary entrance criterion in all randomized controlled trials,” and “no claim can be made that tonsillectomy is effective” if sore throat is absent “even when GABHS is identified.” For children repeatedly positive for GABHS, it “is desirable to rule out streptococcal carriage,” and “streptococcal carriage is strongly suggested by positive strep cultures or other strep tests when the child lacks signs or symptoms of acute pharyngitis.”

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^07169e62]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Results: A total of 247 patients were included in the analysis and randomly split into a training set (N=186) and a validation set (N=61). All the performance values obtained in the training cohort and in the validation set are summarized in the Table 1. To support the decision tree results, an alternative model was created using a logistic regression model. The models including genetic information yielded better performance measurements compared to those without genetic information. According to the decision tree including the genetic analysis, the probability of being classified as SURF having a positive genetic test is 0%, while the same probability increased to 92% if the genetic test is negative and the patient does not present exudative tonsillitis. In the absence of a genetic test, patients showed a higher probability of being classified as SURF in the absence of triggers for episodes and pain at lymph nodes, negative family history, age of disease onset > 2 years, mean duration of episodes > 2.5 days. An external validation is ongoing.

Conclusion: Preliminary evidence-based classification criteria to differentiate SURF patients from the main causes of recurrent fevers in childhood are available. A decision tree including the genetic analysis yielded the highest accuracy. However, the decision tree was able to discriminate SURF patients from confounding diseases even in the absence of information on genetic analysis.

### Quality of life after tonsillectomy in adults with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis [^aececc20]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe changes in disease-specific and global quality of life (QOL) for adults with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis at 6 months and 1 year after tonsillectomy using two instruments: the Tonsil and Adenoid Health Status Instrument (TAHSI) and the SF-12 Health Survey (12-item short form of SF-36 Health Survey).

Study Design and Setting

Multicenter, prospective observational outcomes study.

Results

Seventy-two adults, mean age 28.0 years (SD 7.2 years), were enrolled with follow-up available for 42 adults at 6 months and for 40 adults at 1 year. Patients showed significant improvements in all six subscales of the TAHSI: airway and breathing, infection, health care utilization, cost of care, eating and swallowing, and behavior (all P < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also found in the physical functioning subscale of the SF-12 at 1 year.

Conclusion

After tonsillectomy for recurrent and chronic tonsillitis, we found large improvements in disease-specific and global QOL.

Significance

Most prior studies on tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis have assessed only the frequency of infections as an outcome measure. This study describes the changes in QOL measured in our cohort of reporting adults after tonsillectomy for chronic or recurrent tonsillitis. This study provides prospective evidence of the effectiveness of tonsillectomy on adult QOL.

### Tonsillar Helicobacter pylori colonization in chronic tonsillitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^0ff39a01]. JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Helicobacter pylori colonization contributes significantly to multiple disease states, but its role in the development of tonsillar infection is unclear. Understanding the causes of chronic tonsillitis is important in clinical decision making of this commonly treated disease.

Objective

To assess the correlation between H pylori colonization of tonsillar tissue in chronic tonsillitis and in noninfectious hyperplastic tonsils.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Trial Registry (through June 2014) and relevant article bibliographies.

Study Selection

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the correlation between H pylori colonization in tonsillar tissues of patients undergoing tonsillectomy for either chronic tonsillitis or noninfectious causes. Included studies hypothesized that H pylori played a role in the development of chronic tonsillitis. All included studies investigated the presence of H pylori in tonsillar tissue removed for various indications. Included studies must have used an accepted method of testing for H pylori.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Studies were systematically reviewed by 2 independent reviewers for inclusion. Reported results of H pylori testing between tissues removed for infectious or noninfectious causes were systematically reviewed. The odds ratio of Hpylori colonization in tissue removed for chronic tonsillitis compared with tissue removed for noninfectious causes was calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

Six studies met inclusion criteria and had suitable data for pooling (n=436). Of these, 2 studies measured H pylori colonization of tonsillar tissue in pediatric populations. One study analyzed tissue in both adult and pediatric populations. Noninfectious indications for tonsillectomy included sleep apnea or sleep-related breathing disorder, obstruction, carcinoma, and tonsillar hypertrophy. Overall, tonsillar H pylori colonization was found not to be significantly present more often in tissue samples removed secondary to recurrent infection rather than to noninfectious indications. The odds ratio of H pylori colonization in the tonsils of patients with chronic tonsillitis was 1.993 (95% CI, 0.909-4.371) (P=.09).

Conclusions and Relevance

Helicobacter pylori colonization was not found to be more prevalent on tonsillar tissue with chronic or recurrent infections. The reviewed studies provide no evidence that H pylori infection plays a role in the pathogenesis or development of chronic tonsillitis.

### Surgical removal of tonsils and risk of COVID-19: a nested case-control study using data from UK biobank and AMORIS cohort [^51d62608]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study materials

UK Biobank is a cohort with half a million participants recruited during 2006–2010, including information on socio-demographic factors and lifestyle collected at baseline as well as various health outcomes collected through periodic linkages to multiple registers. AMORIS is a population-based cohort, including 806,328 individuals undergoing health examinations during 1985–1996 in Stockholm mainly who were followed through linkages to different population and health registers individually, using the unique Swedish personal identity numbers. Based on the dates of first COVID-19 diagnosis (January 31st, 2020, in the UK and January 30th, 2020, in Sweden) and the start dates of COVID-19 vaccination (December 8th, 2020, in the UK and December 27th, 2020, in Sweden), we determined the study period as from January 31st to December 31st, 2020, to study the association of tonsillectomy with the risk of COVID-19 in an unvaccinated population.

Study design

Among the 502,384 participants of the UK Biobank, 59,907 had at least one SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, either positive or negative, during the study period, according to data from England, Scotland, and Wales. After excluding participants who withdrew or had conflicting information, participants with adenoidectomy alone before study start or a surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids after study start, as well as participants with a hospitalization record where COVID-19 was listed as a secondary diagnosis (i.e. we could not define the severity of COVID-19 for these individuals), we included 58,888 individuals in the analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). These individuals were classified into three groups, namely cases of severe COVID-19, cases of mild COVID-19, and controls. Severe COVID-19 was ascertained through a hospitalization (including ICU admission) with COVID-19 as the main discharge diagnosis or death due to COIVD-19, identified through inpatient care data and cause of death data, using the 10th International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes U07.1 and U07.2. Mild COVID-19 was defined through a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test without inpatient care or death due to COVID-19. The rest of individuals who tested for COVID-19 but with no positive finding were defined as controls.

### Period prevalence of rheumatic heart disease and the need for a centralized patient registry in American Samoa, 2016 to 2018 [^dbbccc65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a severe, chronic complication of acute rheumatic fever, triggered by group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Centralized patient registries are recommended for RHD prevention and control, but none exists in American Samoa. Using existing RHD tracking systems, we estimated RHD period prevalence and the proportion of people with RHD documented in the electronic health record. Methods and Results RHD cases were identified from a centralized electronic health record system, which retrieved clinical encounters with RHD International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-10-CM ) codes, clinical problem lists referencing RHD, and antibiotic prophylaxis administration records; 3 RHD patient tracking spreadsheets; and an all-cause mortality database. RHD cases had ≥1 clinical encounter with RHD ICD-10-CM codes, a diagnostic echocardiogram, or RHD as a cause of death, or were included in RHD patient tracking spreadsheets. Period prevalence per 1000 population among children aged <18 years and adults aged ≥18 years from 2016 to 2018 and the proportion of people with RHD with ≥1 clinical encounter with an RHD ICD-10-CM code were estimated. From 2016 to 2018, RHD was documented in 327 people (57.2%: children aged <18 years). Overall RHD period prevalence was 6.3 cases per 1000 and varied by age (10.0 pediatric cases and 4.3 adult cases per 1000). Only 67% of people with RHD had ≥1 clinical encounter with an RHD ICD-10-CM code. Conclusions RHD remains a serious public health problem in American Samoa, and the existing electronic health record does not include all cases. A centralized patient registry could improve tracking people with RHD to ensure they receive necessary care.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^227cd21d]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature >38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1d40e8e4]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection—watchful waiting policy attributes emphasize evidence quality, benefits and harms, exclusions, and policy level. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that fail to show clinically important advantages of surgery over observation alone; Grade C, observational studies showing improvement with watchful waiting. Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits: Avoid unnecessary surgery with potential complications of vomiting, bleeding, pain, infection, or anesthesia problems. Risks, harms, costs: Waiting may result in delayed treatment in patients who have unusually frequent and severe recurrent throat infections; potential direct cost of managing future throat infections. Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: Panel consensus that tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection should be limited to circumstances for which clinically important benefits are shown in randomized controlled trials; emphasis on avoiding harm related to surgery or anesthesia in a condition that may be largely self-limited. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exclusions include patients with >1 peritonsillar abscess, personal or family history of rheumatic heart disease, Lemierre’s syndrome, severe infections requiring hospitalization, or numerous repeat infections in a single household (“ping-pong spread”). Policy level: Strong recommendation. Differences of opinions: None.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was deemed exempt from review by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board because it did not constitute human participants research and used deidentified data; the requirement for informed consent was therefore waived. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Identification of New or Missing ICD-10-CM Codes

We used a comprehensive, supervised semiautomated strategy to identify new, missing, or retired ICD-10-CM codes. First, we remapped the previously published CCC V2 ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes using the 2018 General Equivalence Mappings electronic mapping tool from the CMS.All CCC V2 ICD-9-CM codes were forward remapped, and all CCC V2 ICD-10 codes were remapped backward using the General Equivalence Mappings, which allowed for identification of new or missing codes. Second, we manually compared the remapped codes with annual update lists of new ICD-10-CM codes for 2019 to 2023 using the hierarchical ICD-10 code structure to identify related codes that might represent a CCC.Third, 2 complex care pediatricians (J.A.F. and C.F.) independently reviewed all identified candidate codes for inclusion or exclusion in the CCC V3 system based on the CCC definition used to create the previous versions: “Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center.”, Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by joint review of the code or codes in question. Fourth, the final list of CCC V3 codes was created, reviewed for quality, and finalized for use. To enable transparency of code determinations, we created a list of all codes reviewed for inclusion or exclusion for CCC V3 and their determinations, including retired codes that were used in previous CCC versions (eTable 1 in Supplement 1, eTable 2 in Supplement 2, and eTable 3 in Supplement 3).

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^a9e47037]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Randomized trial limitations and evidence grading—when weighing tonsillectomy for recurrent infection, limitations of the evidence include small randomized samples and incomplete follow-up, prompting a downgrade in evidence level. Limitations of the available randomized controlled trials must also be considered when assessing the benefits and harms of surgery. Paradise and colleagues randomized 91 children to surgery versus observation after screening thousands, only a small percentage met strict entry criteria and only about half of eligible children agreed to randomization, and in both studies only about half (46%-62%) of enrolled children completed all 3 years of follow-up. Although these limitations did not invalidate the trials, the panel downgraded the aggregate evidence level from A (randomized trials) to B (randomized trials with limitations).

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^0c1cd023]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children <15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥1 of the following: temperature >38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients’ CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: “Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center”. Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization [-].

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^fdd5fa92]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children—PTB classification and rates are outlined as follows: Primary bleeding is defined as bleeding that occurs within the first 24 hours after the procedure with reported rates ranging from 0.1% to 5.8%. Secondary bleeding occurs >24 hours after surgery, often between 5 and 10 days, with rates from 0.2% to 7.5%. The average reported rate of primary and secondary PTB is approximately 4.2%.

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^1f8463e1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^f2ec9551]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations—GRADE meanings—states that the strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong (“the guideline panel recommends”), or conditional (“the guideline panel suggests”) and has the following interpretations. For a strong recommendation, for patients most fully informed people in this situation would want to follow the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; for clinicians most individuals should receive the intervention or test and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; and for policy makers the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. For a conditional recommendation, for patients the majority of fully informed people in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and a discussion between them and their health care professional may help reach a decision (ie, shared decision making); for clinicians recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences and decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; and for policy makers policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders and performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on documentation of appropriate decision-making processes.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^318b5711]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations—For patients, a strong recommendation means “Most fully informed people in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not,” whereas for a conditional recommendation “The majority of fully informed people in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and it may need more discussion between them and their health care professional first.” For clinicians, strong recommendations state “Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences,” while conditional recommendations specify “Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients; clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with that patient’s values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.” For policy makers, strong recommendations “can be adopted as policy in most situations” and “could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator,” whereas conditional recommendations note “Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision-making is appropriate.” For researchers, strong recommendations are “supported by credible research or other convincing judgments” though sometimes based on “low or very low certainty of the evidence,” while conditional recommendations are “likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research” and that evaluating the underlying judgments “will help identify possible research gaps.”
