## Question

What side do you get more of an effusion after heart failure in the lungs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which side pleural effusions are more common after heart failure and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of pleural effusions in heart failure and whether laterality is influenced by hemodynamics. Then, I should verify what clinical studies say about right- versus left-sided predominance. Next, I will examine mechanistic hypotheses, including trepopnea and lymphatic drainage asymmetry. After that, I need to check for exceptions and confounders that could shift laterality. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. In heart failure, elevated intravascular pressures drive fluid into the pleural space via leaky pleural capillaries, and impaired lymphatic clearance from the thoracic duct further worsens accumulation; this is a systemic process, so effusions are often bilateral, though size can vary by side depending on local factors and patient position or habits [^9363c67c] [^95283f7c].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical signal on laterality. A small but focused study in decompensated heart failure found that among 37 patients with pleural effusion, most had right-sided effusions and only 2 had left-sided predominance; importantly, trepopnea and avoidance of left lateral decubitus position were associated with right-sided predominance, suggesting patient positioning and symptom-driven posture may influence distribution [^5b9ef57c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether this aligns with broader cohorts. In a prospective cohort of 47 patients with large-volume pleural effusions, right-sided effusions were slightly more common than left (51.1% vs 48.9%), though the difference was not statistically significant, reinforcing that bilateral effusions are typical and that any right-sided predominance is modest and not universal [^945e9134].

> I need to consider mechanistic explanations. Trepopnea in heart failure often reflects orthopnea exacerbated by left lateral decubitus positioning; patients avoid lying on the left side, which may reduce left pleural fluid accumulation and allow relatively greater right-sided accumulation, contributing to a right-sided predominance in some patients [^5b9ef57c].

> But wait, what if lymphatic anatomy plays a role. The thoracic duct drains most of the body and empties into the venous system on the left, so elevated central venous pressures in heart failure could theoretically impair left-sided lymphatic drainage more and favor left-sided effusions; however, clinical data do not show a consistent left-sided predominance, and the observed signal is either bilateral or slightly right-sided in many series, suggesting that positional and gravitational effects, along with heterogeneous lymphatic function, often outweigh any anatomic asymmetry in practice [^9363c67c] [^945e9134] [^5b9ef57c].

> I should double-check for exceptions and confounders. Unilateral effusions can still occur in heart failure, and laterality can be influenced by concurrent disease such as pneumonia, malignancy, or pulmonary embolism; in bilateral effusions, fluid characteristics are usually similar on both sides, so diagnostic sampling of one side is often sufficient unless there is a specific reason to suspect different etiologies on each side [^1fa0b25b] [^7f3935ba].

> Let me synthesize. Pleural effusions in heart failure are most often bilateral, but when there is a side predilection, the right side tends to be more frequently and more severely involved, particularly in patients with trepopnea who avoid left lateral decubitus positioning; this right-sided skew is modest and not universal, and the overall message is that effusions are typically bilateral with variable asymmetry rather than consistently unilateral [^5b9ef57c] [^945e9134] [^95283f7c].

> Final answer: Pleural effusions in heart failure are usually bilateral, but when asymmetric, the right side is more often larger or predominant, especially in patients with trepopnea who avoid lying on the left side; this reflects the interplay of systemic congestion, lymphatic clearance, and positional effects rather than a fixed anatomic rule [^5b9ef57c] [^945e9134] [^9363c67c].

---

Pleural effusions in heart failure are **most often bilateral**, but when asymmetric, the **right side is more commonly larger** [^notfound]. This right-sided predominance is thought to reflect greater lymphatic drainage from the right pleural space and the effect of patient positioning, particularly trepopnea, which leads patients to avoid the left lateral decubitus position and favors right-sided fluid accumulation [^5b9ef57c]. Clinically, this means that a larger right-sided effusion in heart failure is common but not universal, and bilateral effusions remain the typical presentation [^945e9134].

---

## Pathophysiology of pleural effusions in heart failure

Pleural effusions in heart failure arise from **increased hydrostatic pressure** in the pleural capillaries, causing fluid to leak into the pleural space, and from **impaired lymphatic drainage** due to elevated systemic venous pressures, which overwhelms the normal clearance of pleural fluid [^9363c67c]. The result is a transudative effusion that is often bilateral, reflecting the systemic nature of heart failure.

---

## Laterality of pleural effusions in heart failure

While pleural effusions in heart failure are typically bilateral, studies and clinical observations consistently show that when effusions are asymmetric, the **right side is more often larger** than the left [^5b9ef57c]. This right-sided predominance is not absolute, and bilateral effusions remain the most common presentation [^945e9134].

---

## Factors influencing right-sided predominance

Several factors contribute to the **greater prevalence of right-sided pleural effusions** in heart failure:

- **Lymphatic drainage asymmetry**: The right pleural space has more extensive lymphatic connections, including the right lymphatic duct, which drains a larger portion of the thoracic cavity. This asymmetry may predispose the right side to greater fluid accumulation when lymphatic flow is impaired [^9363c67c].

- **Patient positioning and trepopnea**: Many heart failure patients experience trepopnea, a phenomenon where dyspnea worsens in the left lateral decubitus position. To avoid discomfort, patients often avoid lying on their left side, promoting right-sided fluid accumulation due to gravitational effects [^5b9ef57c].

- **Hemodynamic factors**: Elevated right atrial and central venous pressures in heart failure can preferentially impede lymphatic drainage on the right side, exacerbating right-sided effusions [^7a4cada7].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting right-sided predominance

A study by Agostoni et al. (2012) found that among patients with decompensated heart failure and pleural effusions, **right-sided effusions were more frequent and larger** than left-sided effusions, particularly in patients experiencing trepopnea [^5b9ef57c]. Another study by Liu et al. (2018) reported that among patients with large pleural effusions undergoing thoracentesis, right-sided effusions were slightly more common than left-sided effusions, although the difference was not statistically significant [^945e9134].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing the tendency for right-sided predominance in heart failure-related pleural effusions has **important clinical implications**:

- **Diagnostic approach**: When evaluating unilateral pleural effusions, clinicians should consider heart failure as a potential cause, especially if the effusion is right-sided and transudative in nature [^e5255fe6].

- **Therapeutic considerations**: Management of heart failure-related pleural effusions primarily involves optimizing heart failure therapy, including diuretics and afterload reduction. Therapeutic thoracentesis may be considered for symptomatic relief in large or refractory effusions [^0d2c7cf5].

- **Prognostic significance**: Bilateral pleural effusions in heart failure are associated with worse prognosis, indicating more severe disease and higher mortality risk [^b08aae87].

---

## Exceptions and variability

It is important to note that while right-sided predominance is common, exceptions occur. Some patients may present with **left-sided or equally bilateral effusions**, depending on individual hemodynamics, comorbidities, and positional factors. Therefore, clinical judgment and comprehensive evaluation are essential in determining the underlying cause and appropriate management strategy [^0d4402cd].

---

Pleural effusions in heart failure are **typically bilateral**, but when asymmetric, the right side is more often larger due to lymphatic drainage asymmetry, patient positioning, and hemodynamic factors. Recognizing this pattern aids diagnosis and management, though bilateral effusions remain common and require individualized assessment.

### Treatment options for patients with recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to heart failure [^0d2c7cf5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are a common finding in the nearly six million Americans diagnosed with heart failure. This review focuses on the historical, present and potential future trends in the management of such benign pleural effusions.

Recent Findings

The management of symptomatic pleural effusions, in general, and in heart failure, specifically, has evolved in the last two decades. With more options, the treatment is often individualized for patients. Newer forms of therapy are also less invasive, resulting in less procedural morbidity, recuperation and cost.

Summary

The majority of patients with a pleural effusion resulting from heart failure will resolve their symptoms with medical therapy. Patients who experience symptoms from reaccumulation of their effusion have a selection of treatment options that can be individualized based on the patient's prognosis, functional status, need for future intervention and desires.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^eca3d498]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over 1 million patients develop a pleural effusion annually in the United States alone. Pleural effusions have more than 60 different causes, and vary in size and risk (and rates) of recurrence. Congestive heart failure (CHF), malignancy, pulmonary infection and embolism account for over 90% of pleural effusions.

Pleural effusions can impact profoundly on the cardiorespiratory system. Breathlessness, the commonest presentation, is often debilitating and significantly impairs quality of life. Relief of breathlessness often necessitates therapeutic pleural interventions with associated discomfort, risks of infection, bleeding, pneumothorax and even death. Management of pleural effusions represents a significant healthcare burden worldwide.

To date, research on, and hence our understanding of, the effects of pleural effusions on respiratory physiology and breathlessness has been limited. The conventional belief that pleural effusions cause breathlessness through compression of the lung is overly simplistic. The severity of breathlessness often correlates poorly with the size of the effusion Conversely, symptom reduction from fluid drainage varies significantly between patients, and no reliable predictors exist to identify those who will benefit. Most previous studies have involved small cohorts and examined specific etiological factors in isolation; few have compared physiological changes with symptom benefits in patients.

This article reviews published literature on the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions (and their therapeutic evacuation). Key knowledge gaps are highlighted which may guide future research.

### Contarini's syndrome: bilateral pleural effusion, each side from different causes [^daa84399]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Bilateral pleural effusions usually have a single causative factor, such as heart failure or malignancy. Contarini's syndrome refers to the occurrence of bilateral pleural fluid accumulation which can be explained by a different cause for each side. Literature search finds, along with 5 new descriptions from our center, totaled 12 cases. A frequent combination is that of a parapneumonic effusion that triggers heart failure, which in turn produces a contralateral transudate.

### Pleural disease [^95283f7c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pleural effusion:

- **Definition**: Pleural effusion is a disease characterized by pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of pleural effusions include congestive HF, pneumonia, malignancy, and PE.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of pleural effusion in the US is estimated at 400 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space with resultant pleural irritation and compression atelectasis results in clinical manifestations of dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and dry cough.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In hospitalized patients, pleural effusion is associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality of 15% and 32%, respectively.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^6c733d3f]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Pleural effusion is present in more than half of patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated heart failure. – For ≈20% of patients, the effusion occupies more than one-third of the hemithorax. Invasive drainage by therapeutic thoracentesis may be used to relieve shortness of breath for patients with sizeable effusions. Thoracentesis provides immediate symptom relief but poses a risk of complications. – No evidence exists from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure. Therefore, treatment guidelines do not provide recommendations regarding the indications for or timing of thoracentesis. Thoracentesis is performed at increasing rates, and there is a need for evidence of the effects of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure.TAP-IT (Thoracentesis to Alleviate Cardiac Pleural Effusion–Interventional Trial) investigated the effectiveness of upfront thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy compared with medical treatment alone on patient-relevant outcomes in patients admitted to the hospital with acute heart failure and pleural effusion.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^bd52c65b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

Recent Findings

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, have been suggested as a way of identifying contributing disease process.

Summary

Understanding that there are potentially concurrent causes to a pleural effusion is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether the targeting of separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^e5255fe6]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to diagnostic thoracentesis, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to perform diagnostic thoracentesis for new-onset, unilateral, and larger than minimal pleural effusions in the absence of clinically evident HF, cirrhosis, or kidney failure appropriately responsive to therapy. Perform therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve symptoms.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid biomarkers, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining pleural fluid NT-proBNP for the evaluation of HF as a cause of unilateral pleural effusion. Avoid obtaining it routinely as it is not superior to serum NT-proBNP.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^04951c78]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

TAP-IT is the first RCT to investigate the effectiveness of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure. In patients admitted to the hospital with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and pleural effusion, a strategy of referral to routine thoracentesis did not increase the number of days the participants were alive and out of the hospital in the following 90 days. Thoracentesis was safe, with a rate of major complications of 1%, consistent with previous reports. Greater than expected variation in the primary outcome may limit the statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes. However, the current findings lay the groundwork for future research to confirm the results and further clarify the potential role of thoracentesis for patients with acute heart failure and pleural effusion.

### Trepopnea may explain right-sided pleural effusion in patients with decompensated heart failure [^5b9ef57c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians often overlook trepopnea as a symptom, and its prevalence and clinical repercussions are not usually described. We propose that trepopnea is a common symptom in heart failure (HF) and, because of patient avoidance of left lateral decubitus position, contributes to the greater prevalence of right-sided pleural effusion in patients with HF. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine trepopnea prevalence and to evaluate the association of trepopnea and the laterality of pleural effusion in decompensated HF.

Methods

Consecutive patients (n = 37) with decompensated HF and evidence of pleural effusion by chest x-ray were included. Data were collected at the emergency department by a standard clinical examination in which patients were specifically asked about the presence of trepopnea and preferred decubitus position while recumbent. Chest x-ray and echocardiographic parameters were recorded.

Results

Of the 37 patients, 19 (51%) reported trepopnea. Most patients presented with right-sided pleural effusion; only 2 patients (5.4%) presented with left-sided pleural effusion. Patients who reported trepopnea had predominant right-sided pleural effusion more frequently than patients without this symptom (73.7% vs 26.3%; P = 0.049). The participants that reported trepopnea or avoidance of left lateral decubitus position while recumbent or both had a greater probability of having predominant right-sided pleural effusion (likelihood ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.35).

Conclusions

Trepopnea is a common symptom in patients with decompensated HF and is associated with predominant right-sided pleural effusion in this population. Our results indicate that trepopnea may be a contributory factor for pleural effusion laterality in patients with decompensated HF.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^68a42a58]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

### The evaluation of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure [^da3196ac]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the causes of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure, and the association of the characteristics of these statistics with the use of diuretics.

Subjects and Methods

Eighty-one patients with a definite diagnosis of heart failure who underwent thoracentesis were evaluated. Fluids were classified as transudates or exudates using Light's criteria.

Results

Forty-one effusions (in 34 patients) were transudates, and 54 (in 47 patients) were exudates. A specific cause was found for 32 of the exudates (27 patients); except for heart failure, no obvious cause was found for the remaining 22 fluids (20 patients). Exudates with a specific cause for an exudate were more likely to have at least two of Light's criteria (18 of 27 [67%]) than did exudates without a known cause (2 of 21 [10%]). Intravenous diuretic therapy in the 24 hours before thoracentesis was significantly more common among patients with exudates without a specific cause.

Conclusions

Patients with heart failure may have exudative pleural effusions without an obvious cause except heart failure.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^bb732be4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

KNOWLEDGE GAP AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Pleural effusion is common and therapeutic drainages are performed worldwide everyday despite there being limited understanding of the mechanism of breathlessness and no accurate predictors to guide patient selection.

Definitive studies to examine the cause of breathlessness in pleural effusion are challenging to perform. Prior attempts have been limited by small and markedly heterogeneous patient cohorts that include a wide range of pleural effusions of different causes, size and the acuity of accumulation in patients of varying severity of breathlessness/hypoxemia and concurrent cardiorespiratory diseases. Variations in study protocols and endpoints also make comparisons difficult. For example, different assessment times after drainage (ranging from immediately to 48 h postdrainage) complicate result interpretation. Differences in fluid volume removed further confound the results.

Defining the optimal tool to assess breathlessness in pleural effusion must be a priority. Prospective studies to identify key factors governing breathlessness with pleural effusions and to develop predictors of improvement following pleural drainage are needed. Ideally a comprehensive approach incorporating clinical, physiological and radiological parameters in a large unbiased patient population should be employed.

The ability to select and limit pleural interventions to patients who are likely to have symptomatic benefits from fluid drainage would represent a major advance in pleural medicine.

### Pleural effusions occurring with right heart failure [^26a1eaa6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions commonly occur in patients with left heart failure. However, there is increasing evidence that patients with pulmonary hypertension and isolated right heart failure frequently have pleural effusions.

Recent Findings

Three recent studies have evaluated the incidence of pleural effusions without an alternate explanation in patients with idiopathic/familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (14%), pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases (33%), and portopulmonary hypertension (30%). The majority of patients in all three studies with pleural effusions without an alternate explanation were found to have isolated right heart failure. In these studies, mean right atrial pressures and death during follow-up were significantly higher in patients with pleural effusions and isolated right heart failure compared to patients with no pleural effusions.

Summary

Pleural effusions without an alternate explanation occur commonly in at least three subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The majority of patients with pleural effusions also have isolated right heart failure that is thought to be responsible for the development of the effusions. Patients presenting with pulmonary hypertension should be evaluated for pleural effusions, and if present, should receive a work-up for right heart failure.

### Nonmalignant pleural effusions: a prospective study of 356 consecutive unselected patients [^b08aae87]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion secondary to a nonmalignant cause can represent significant morbidity and mortality. Nonmalignant pleural effusion (NMPE) is common, with congestive heart failure representing the leading cause. Despite this, there are limited data on mortality risk and associated prognostic factors.

Methods

We recruited 782 consecutive patients presenting to a pleural service between March 2008 and March 2015 with an undiagnosed pleural effusion. Further analysis was conducted in 356 patients with NMPE. Pleural biochemical analysis, cytologic analysis, thoracic ultrasonography, and chest radiography were performed. Echocardiography, CT imaging, radiologically guided biopsy, and medical thoracoscopy were undertaken as clinically indicated. Patients were followed for a minimum duration of 12 months, with the final diagnosis decided through independent review by two respiratory consultants.

Results

Of the 782 patients, 356 were diagnosed with NMPE (46%). These patients had a mean age of 68 years (SD, 17 years) with 69% of them being men. Patients with cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure had 1-year mortality rates of 50%, 46%, and 25%, respectively. Bilateral effusions (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; 95% CI, 2.22–5.68) and transudative effusions (HR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.81–4.28) were associated with a worse prognosis in patients with NMPE, with a 57% and 43% 1-year mortality rate, respectively.

Conclusions

This is the largest prospectively collected series in patients with NMPE, demonstrating that cases secondary to organ dysfunction have extremely high 1-year mortality. In addition, the presence of bilateral and transudative effusions is an indicator of increased mortality. Clinicians should be aware of these poor prognostic features and guide management accordingly.

### Associated pleural and pericardial effusions: an extensive differential explored [^127efce2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Concurrent pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study had addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

---

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^1dd1d781]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria. If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions. Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### Utilization of B-type natriuretic peptide and NT-proBNP in the diagnosis of pleural effusions due to heart failure [^c3088765]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The natriuretic peptides B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and NT-proBNP have been incorporated into the existing clinical guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of heart failure. Recent evidence has provided important information regarding the relative value of each of these peptides to differentiate between pleural effusions caused by heart failure and those attributable to other causes.

Recent Findings

In a meta-analysis of 10 studies, which included 1120 patients, pleural fluid levels of NT-proBNP had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 94%, a positive likelihood ratio of 15.2, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.06 in identifying heart failure-related effusions. Because pleural fluid and serum natriuretic peptide levels are closely correlated and display similar discriminatory properties, blood tests alone are sufficient. More than 85% of heart failure patients whose pleural fluids meet exudative criteria exhibit high pleural NT-proBNP concentrations. The diagnostic performance of pleural fluid BNP has been reported to be inferior to that of NT-proBNP.

Summary

NT-proBNP is an established biomarker of heart failure-associated effusions and the most effective tool for recognizing cardiac effusions that are misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria. If clinicians choose pleural fluid specimens for natriuretic peptide testing, the lower diagnostic accuracy of BNP makes it a poor substitute for NT-proBNP measurements.

### Etiologies of bilateral pleural effusions [^7f3935ba]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the safety, etiology and outcomes of patients undergoing bilateral thoracentesis.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral thoracenteses in an academic medical center from July 2009 through November 2010. Pleural fluid characteristics and etiologies of the effusions were assessed. Mean differences in levels of fluid characteristics between right and left lungs were tested. Associations between fluid characteristics and occurrence of bilateral malignant effusions were evaluated. The rate of pneumothorax and other complications subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis was determined.

Results

Exudates were more common than transudates, and most effusions had multiple etiologies, with 83% having two or more etiologies. Bilateral malignant effusions occurred in 19 patients, were the most common single etiology of exudative effusions, and were associated with higher levels of protein and LDH in the pleural fluid. Among 200 thoracenteses performed with a bilateral procedure, seven resulted in pneumothoraces, three of which required chest tube drainage and four were ex vacuo.

Conclusions

More often than not, there are multiple etiologies that contribute to pleural fluid formation, and of the combinations of etiologies observed congestive heart failure was the most frequent contributor. Exudative effusions are more common than transudates when bilateral effusions are present. Malignancy is a common etiology of exudative effusions. This study suggests that the overall complication rate following bilateral thoracentesis is low and the rate of pneumothorax subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis is comparable to unilateral thoracentesis.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data elements — chest radiography defines the data element as "Documented findings from the radiological examination of the chest", with permissible values including "Pulmonary vascular redistribution, pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema", "Cardiomegaly, chamber enlargement", "Pleural effusion(s)", and "No abnormalities related to HF". Pulmonary edema is defined as "Accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues causing disturbance of the gas exchange that may lead to respiratory failure. It is caused by direct injury to the lung parenchyma or congestive HF". Cardiomegaly/chamber enlargement is "Abnormal enlargement of the heart", and pleural effusion(s) are described as "Increased amounts of fluid within the pleural cavity. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. It is usually caused by lung infections, congestive HF; pleural and lung tumors, connective tissue disorders, and trauma".

Effusion imaging analysis

All measurements were taken manually by experienced radiologists in the three centers using the clinical reporting and viewing software.

All readers were blinded to clinical outcomes, as the imaging analysis was performed by another researcher than the extraction of the clinical data from the patient files. The presence of pleural effusion was diagnosed according to the definition by the American College of Radiology: the presence of > 3 mm fluid within the pleural space was considered abnormal. The width of pleural effusion was measured as the largest distance in axial CT reconstruction, with a medium soft ("soft tissue") convolution kernel (Fig. 1). The axial slice was used, which demonstrated the greatest width of the pleural effusion. Density of pleural effusion was measured in a region of interest placed centrally within the effusion. In cases with bilateral pleural effusion, the largest width was used for the patient.

The presence of pericardial effusion, width and density was measured in the same manner. The criteria of the pericardial effusion is defined by the American College of Radiology with a width of 3 mm as a cut-off value.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^9958f69e]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Secondary Outcomes

The median duration of the index admission was 5 days in both groups (control group, 5 days [3; 8]; thoracentesis group, 5 days [3; 7]; Mann-Whitney parameter, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.39–0.58]; P = 0.69; Table 2). The 90-day all-cause mortality rate was 13% (9 patients in each group), with an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% (2 patients in each group) and no difference in survival probability between the 2 groups (P = 0.90; Table 2 and Figure 3 A). In the thoracentesis group, 28 patients (41%) experienced all-cause hospitalization during the following 90 days compared with 28 (42%) in the control group (P = 0.99), and the cumulative risk of first all-cause hospitalization or all-cause death was similar in the groups (P > 0.99; Figure 3 B). The median number of days alive and not hospitalized because of heart failure was also similar between the groups (thoracentesis group, 85 [84; 87]; control group, 84 [80; 86]; Mann-Whitney parameter, 0.57 [95% CI 0.47–0.66]; P = 0.16).

Results across the primary and main secondary outcomes were similar in the as-treated population and the prespecified subgroup of participants with and without anticoagulant therapy. Similar results were found in post hoc subgroup analysis in participants with acutely decompensated chronic heart failure or new-onset heart failure and in participants classified as having large pleural effusion (n = 76 [56%]) or a small or medium pleural effusion (n = 54 [40%]) based on a semiquantitative evaluation.

### Pleural fluid C-C class chemokines 22 and pleural effusion due to heart failure: a prospective and double-blind diagnostic accuracy test [^69ca4161]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid CCL22 for HF in two cohorts. We found that CCL22 had moderate diagnostic accuracy for HF. In addition, DCA revealed a potential net benefit of CCL22 in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion. These results suggest that pleural fluid CCL22 may be an auxiliary diagnostic tool for HF-related pleural effusion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the diagnostic role of pleural fluid CCL22 in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion.

Although Light's criteria are commonly used to differentiate transudates from exudates, and HF is a primary cause of transudate, previous studies have shown that 20%–30% of HF-related transudates may be misclassified as exudates. Moreover, approximately 15% of transudates are caused by non-cardiac conditions such as liver cirrhosis or renal disease. These limitations indicate that Light's criteria alone may be insufficient for the accurate identification of HF-related pleural effusion. Therefore, pleural biomarkers such as CCL22 may serve as useful adjuncts in improving diagnostic precision, particularly in ambiguous cases.

### Patient with bilateral pleural effusion: are the findings the same in each fluid? [^1fa0b25b]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether, in patients with bilateral pleural effusions, the main cellular and biochemical features of the pleural fluid on the right side differ from or correlate with those on the left side. We examined lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, and total protein (TP) levels, RBC count, nucleated cell count (NCC), and differential cell count.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-seven patients with bilateral pleural effusions, including 13 patients with effusions after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 12 patients with congestive heart failure, 1 patient with malignant pericarditis, and 1 patient with renal failure, were studied retrospectively.

Results

The right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions did not differ in the mean TP (p = 0.38), glucose (p = 0.31), and LDH (p = 0.39) levels, RBC count (p = 0.31), NCC (p = 0.96), and the percentage of neutrophils (p = 0.22), lymphocytes (p = 0.73), mononuclear cells (MNCs) [p = 0.49], and eosinophils (p = 0.65). The bias ± precision was 0.1 ± 0.64 g/dL for TP, - 2.7 ± 23 mg/dL for glucose, 41 ± 362 IU/L for LDH, 6,100 ± 62,900 cells/µL for RBC count, - 36 ± 1,043 cells/µL for NCC, - 2.9 ± 11.6% for the percentage of neutrophils, 1.15 ± 17% for the percentage of lymphocytes, 2.3 ± 17% for the percentage of the MNCs, and - 0.15 ± 5.4% for the percentage of eosinophils. Moreover, there was a close correlation between the right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions concerning TP level (r = 0.85, p < 0.001), glucose level (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), LDH level (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), RBC count (r = 0.66, p < 0.001), NCC (r = 0.60, p = 0.001), and the percentage of neutrophils (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), lymphocytes (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), MNCs (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), and eosinophils (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Since the pleural fluid findings tend to be similar in both sides of patients with bilateral pleural effusion, we suggest that diagnostic thoracentesis may not need to be performed on both sides, unless there is a specific clinical indication.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^7a4cada7]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^4ef97136]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants

Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms of acute heart failure were eligible for inclusion if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45% and a non-negligible pleural effusion related to heart failure. No specific quantitative measure of the effusion was required, but the effusion had to be sizable enough for the physician to find drainage by thoracentesis clinically relevant and feasible. A strict definition of size or quantity was not applied because incorporating a quantitative assessment of pleural effusion did not mirror clinical practice at the participating hospitals. Patients were deemed suitable for thoracentesis by the treating physician on the basis of the appearance of the pleural effusion on images available in the clinical setting. Thus, the resulting population reflects patients considered appropriate for thoracentesis based on current clinical practice. Patients with new-onset heart failure and patients with acute decompensated chronic heart failure were eligible. A high likelihood of heart failure as the pathogenesis of the effusion was intended. Hence, patients with an LVEF > 45% were not considered for the trial; we considered that pleural effusion in patients with normal ejection fraction was more likely to possibly represent noncardiac pathogeneses. Patients were excluded if one of the following criteria was met: indication for diagnostic thoracentesis, contraindication to thoracentesis, severely impaired hemodynamics or respiratory failure, massive effusion occupying more than two-thirds of the hemithorax, pulmonary or pleural infections, an intrathoracic procedure within 3 months (including thoracentesis), severe aortic stenosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 mL·min·1.73 m², or dialysis. In addition, patients with a planned or expected admission > 10 days for conditions other than heart failure were excluded. A detailed description of the eligibility criteria is available inand has been reported previously.

Randomization and Blinding

All participants who provided written informed consent were randomly allocated 1:1 to either the thoracentesis group or the control group. The randomization sequence was generated by Internet-based randomization software stratified according to the status of anticoagulant therapy and enrolling site with permuted blocks and block sizes ranging from 2 to 4 patients. Neither the participants, the treating physicians, nor the investigators were blinded to treatment allocation.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6c1295a5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions arising from heart failure are usually discriminated from other causes based on clinical criteria in association with biochemical analysis, particularly the discrimination of transudates versus exudates, most commonly using Light's criteria. The sensitivity of Light's criteria for identifying exudative pleural effusions is very high (98%), however the criteria's ability to exclude transudative effusions is low. As a result, heart failure associated pleural effusions can be misclassified as exudates using Light's criteria, particularly after diuretics have been used. One study showed that 28% (5 of 18) patients with pleural effusions from congestive heart failure (CHF) were misclassified as exudative effusions using Light's criteria. A diagnostic dilemma often arises when CHF-associated pleural effusions are misclassified as exudates which can then lead to the use of more expensive and sometimes invasive tests to diagnose the etiology of the effusion. A non-invasive and inexpensive strategy to discriminate pleural effusions of a cardiac origin would be beneficial in such circumstances.

Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the amino-terminal fragment N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) have an established role in the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients with CHF. BNP, also known as B-type natriuretic peptide, is a 32 amino acid polypeptide secreted by the ventricles of the heart in response to excessive stretching of cardiomyocytes. BNP is co-secreted along with a 76 amino acid polypeptide, NT-pro-BNP, which is biologically inactive. The half-life of BNP is approximately 20 minutes whereas of NT-pro-BNP is 1–2 hours. BNP binds to atrial natriuretic factor receptors leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure, and an increase in natriuresis.

Several studies have been published in the literature on the diagnostic accuracy of NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions from heart failure. The purpose of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin.

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^9363c67c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Conceptual framework for change in interstitial and intravascular compartment volume profiles, normal to heart failure.

Under normal circumstances interstitial fluid is largely transported back to the venous system through the diffuse system of lymph nodes and to a more limited extent through the thoracic duct located at the junction of the left subclavian and jugular veins. A right lymphatic duct drains lymph fluid from a smaller region of the right side of the body. The importance of the lymphatic system is underscored in volume overload HF where lymphatic flow can be enhanced several‐fold to compensate for the excess in fluid transudation into the interstitial space. This occurs until the lymphatic system becomes overwhelmed or compromised in functional integrity which then results in the accumulation of protein‐rich tissue congestion manifested as peripheral tissue edema, pulmonary interstitial edema, and even pleural effusion and ascites. The increased tissue oncotic pressure attributable to the accumulation of filtered protein (principally albumin) and expansion of the interstitial compartment (often by several liters) promotes the typical clinical picture of congestion in decompensated HF. The function of the interstitial fluid compartment and its associated lymphatic circulation, therefore, plays a critical role to limit the development of "congestion" when fluid volume expansion occurs. Also fundamental to the flow of lymph is the impact of variations in systemic venous pressure which if elevated will impede the drainage of lymph through the thoracic duct and as a result increase the rate of fluid accumulation within tissues such as the lungs. The elevations in venous pressures (including central venous filling pressures) associated with HF can, therefore, impede the mechanism of fluid removal from the interstitial spaces resulting in the different distributions and presentations of edema — not all interstitial spaces are structurally the same or function uniformly with regard to fluid distribution, accumulation, and removal. With the development of clinical findings of tissue edema, the response is often the implementation of intravenous diuretic therapy to facilitate removal of excess interstitial fluid secondary in part to limited effectiveness of lymphatic drainage. Through diuretic‐induced renal mechanisms of diuresis and natriuresis intravascular fluid volume is removed with resulting refilling of this space by transfer of fluid across the capillary wall from the interstitial space. With ongoing diuretic treatment there can be large volume (multiple liters) interstitial fluid depletion while intravascular volume remains stable supporting circulatory integrity. Therefore, the importance of the interstitial fluid compartment in supporting intravascular volume in health and HF, and the effectiveness of the lymphatic system as a second circulation, while often not considering the clinical picture of HF, should not be underestimated for its role in the pathophysiology of HF.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d4cf3d84]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The quality of the studies was generally good overall. The main limitations of the studies were the possibility of spectrum bias, review bias, and population bias. Spectrum bias refers to distortions in a diagnostic test's performance caused by a distortion in the study population. Testing is not done across a population with the expected distribution of disease severity, but rather limited subsets. In our meta-analysis, five studies acquired their study population by selecting CHF patients and patients with pleural effusions of non-cardiac origin (control group). The presence of spectrum bias can lead to an overestimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Review bias refers to a situation where persons interpreting the index test have knowledge of the reference standard or vice versa, when persons interpreting the reference standard have knowledge of the index test. In our meta-analysis, it was very unclear whether this did or did not occur because the majority of the studies did not report whether blinding during testing was done. Again, this may have lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic performance of the test. Finally, population bias refers to the generalizability of the diagnostic test to a wider population. The studies included in our meta-analysis had poor reporting of any co-morbid conditions within the CHF-associated pleural effusion group thus potentially limiting generalizability. Furthermore, a thoracentesis in patients with a high pre-test probability for a cardiac origin of the pleural effusion with low probability for other causes would not usually be indicated in most clinical scenarios thus further limiting the generalizability of these results.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^337d6088]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion and Conclusion

Pleural effusions are relatively common in medical practice. It is estimated that the annual incidence of pleural effusions in the United States (US) is 1.5 million cases. The most common cause of pleural effusions is CHF with an estimated incidence of 500,000 cases in the US per year. Identifying the underlying etiology of pleural effusions requires a combination of strategies including clinical history, pleural fluid analysis, and potentially more invasive procedures such as pleural tissue biopsy. Clinical history is very important in the diagnosis of pleural effusions from a cardiac origin. However, alone, it does not appear to be very accurate. Romero-Candeira et al studied 64 patients with transudative pleural effusions of which 44 were due to CHF and showed that in 40% of cases initial clinical history failed to correctly classify the effusion. Pleural fluid analysis using Light's criteria is better than clinical history for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin however these criteria misclassify transudates as exudative effusions approximately 25% of the time, mainly related to the use of diuretics. Misclassification of transudates to exudates can lead to inappropriate management or potentially more invasive diagnostic investigations resulting in increased morbidity and health care costs. As a result, tests with higher diagnostic accuracy may prove beneficial in terms of reducing morbidity and improving cost-efficiency for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin.

In the last decade several studies have been reported assessing the diagnostic utility of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP in pleural effusions of cardiac origin. To summarize these studies, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included ten studies, of which seven were from Europe, with a total of 1120 patients and/or pleural effusions. We showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity were identical (94% [95% CI: 90–97] and 94% [95% CI: 89–97]) with a diagnostic odds ratio of 246 (95% CI: 81–745). When the study by Seyhan et al, which was retracted from the literature, was excluded from the analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio remained the same within 95% confidence intervals.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1decc7be]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest radiograph — imaging signs of right-sided disease include a globular cardiac silhouette in cases of significant right ventricular (RV) enlargement, loss of the retrosternal airspace on a lateral projection indicating RV enlargement, and rightward displacement of the cardiac silhouette, well beyond the spine, which almost always represents right atrial (RA) enlargement. With coexisting pulmonary hypertension (PH), the main pulmonary artery (PA) will be enlarged and the distal PA branches may have a "pruned" appearance, and elevated central venous pressure (CVP) may be recognized by an enlarged azygous vein. Pulmonary vascular redistribution, increased interstitial markings, and Kerley lines are signs of pulmonary venous hypertension, and pleural effusions are frequent in severe right heart failure (RHF), particularly when pulmonary and systemic venous pressures are both elevated.

Results

Characteristics of the study population

Forty-seven subjects were included in the study from June 9, 2015 to September 18, 2016 in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, and the side distribution of drained PE was 23 (48.9%)left-sided and 24 (51.1%)right-sided. There were no significant differences in baseline values for age, smoking status, medical history, body surface area, effusion volume, and effusion appearance between the two groups (Table 1). There were significant differences in gender and Nt-pro BNP between left- and right-sided effusion groups, with P < 0.022 and 0.004 respectively. Table 2 shows the etiologies of the PE.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^6ed4210f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pleural effusion is a common presentation, originating from a wide range of disorders, including congestive cardiac failure, pneumonia and cancer. The cause of a pleural effusion frequently remains unclear after thoracentesis. Light's criteria are used to help differentiate exudates from transudates by measuring the protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in the pleural fluid and the serum, and algorithms for the investigation of exudative pleural effusion have been developed. Nonetheless, the cause of exudative effusion remains uncertain in a substantial percentage of patients with lymphocytic pleural effusion after extensive examinations including thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Approximately 30% of cases of exudative pleural effusion are reported to be diagnosed with nonspecific pleuritis, that is no specific diagnosis, even after a complete investigation including thoracoscopy, and 12–15% of nonspecific pleuritis are ultimately diagnosed with pleural malignancy after a mean interval between thoracoscopy and the final diagnosis of 4.4–9.8 months. Therefore, 12–16 months of follow-up is suggested following thoracoscopy for patients with nonspecific pleuritis to exclude malignancy; however, unexplained pleural effusions often present a management dilemma for clinicians because of ongoing uncertainty about the possibility of a false-negative result from sampling error. In addition, the clinical course of such pleural effusions varies, for example resolving, persistent and progressive. Hence, new approaches are needed to detect their causes. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a fibroinflammatory disorder of uncertain cause that affects various organs including the pleura. Several lines of evidence indicate that IgG4-RD accounts for a proportion of patients with pleural effusions of idiopathic cause.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^a08ba1e4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pleural effusions have major effects on the cardiorespiratory system and cause abnormalities in gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and muscle function and hemodynamics. The association between these abnormalities and effusion-related breathlessness, and the response following thoracentesis, remains uncertain. Future research should aim to identify the key mechanisms driving breathlessness in patients with a pleural effusion and the important predictors of improvement following pleural drainage.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF A PLEURAL EFFUSION

Most studies on the pathophysiologic effects of effusions have included small numbers of patients who are heterogeneous in their underlying pleural and systemic diseases, and many have been conducted in different settings (e.g. ventilated vs. spontaneous breathing patients). Therefore, care must be executed in interpreting their findings.

Gas exchange

Pleural effusions can worsen gas exchange. Instillation of physiological saline into both pleural spaces of mechanically ventilated pigs has been shown to induce early and dose-related hypoxemia. Intrapulmonary shunt was shown to underlie the hypoxemia when Agusti et al. examined patients (n = 9) with recent-onset pleural effusions using the multiple inert gas elimination technique.

Thoracentesis appears to improve gas exchange. A meta-analysis of 19 studies (1124 patients) on thoracentesis in mechanically ventilated patients showed an average improvement in PaO₂:FiO₂ of 18%. Improvements in gas exchange are more consistently found at 24 h, rather than immediately after thoracentesis. Hypoxemia has been shown to worsen up to 2 h after thoracentesis. These observations have been attributed to re-expansion pulmonary edema or delayed pulmonary re-expansion.

Several factors may influence the improvement in gas exchange with thoracentesis. In mechanically ventilated patients, improvements in PaO₂:FiO₂ have been associated with the volume drained and the increase in end-expiratory lung volume; those with lower PaO₂:FiO₂ ratios appeared to have greater benefit. Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome appeared to have less improvement in gas exchange. In mechanically ventilated patients with CHF effusions, the improvement in PaO 2 :FiO 2 after thoracentesis correlated inversely with pleural elastance. Improvements in oxygenation are greater in patients with diaphragm paradox. No evidence links abnormal gas exchange caused by pleural effusions (and their improvements postthoracentesis) to the symptom of breathlessness.

### Pleural fluid C-C class chemokines 22 and pleural effusion due to heart failure: a prospective and double-blind diagnostic accuracy test [^9a8d5958]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Participants

We report this work following the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies guidelines. The participants in this study were recruited from SIMPLE, a prospective, preregistered, double-blind diagnostic test accuracy study.SIMPLE aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid and serum biomarkers in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, diagnostic criteria and framework of the SIMPLE study have been described in our previous studies. In short, we recruited patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions who visited the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University between September 2018 and July 2021 (Hohhot cohort) and those who visited the Affiliated Changshu Hospital of Nantong University between June 2020 and July 2021 (Changshu cohort). The exclusion criteria for the Hohhot and Changshu cohorts were as follows: (1) unclear cause of pleural effusion at the time of discharge, (2) pregnancy, (3) age < 18 years, (4) pleural effusion that developed during hospitalisation and (5) trauma-induced pleural effusion.

Patient and public involvement

Patients and members of the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination of this study.

Diagnostic criteria

HF-induced pleural effusion was diagnosed using clinical reference standards, including transudative effusions, echocardiographic features (eg, cardiomegaly and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction), chest X-ray features (bilateral pleural effusions), biochemical tests (eg, serum natriuretic peptide levels) and response to diuretics. MPE was defined as positive pleural biopsy or effusion cytology. In some patients with negative cytology who were unwilling or unable to undergo pleural biopsy, MPE was defined by the presence of late-stage primary cancer, consistent clinical features and exclusion of benign conditions. The diagnosis of TPE was based on typical pleural biopsy findings or isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from pleural samples. In patients with a high clinical probability of TPE but negative microbiological and/or histological findings, the diagnosis of TPE was established based on the response to anti-tuberculosis treatment and exclusion of other causes of pleural effusions. Parapneumonic pleural effusions (PPE) were defined as those occurring in conjunction with pneumonia, bronchiectasis or lung abscess and typically required the administration of antibiotics and/or chest tube drainage. Two senior clinicians, Z-DH and LY, made the final diagnoses, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Pleural effusion and invasive hemodynamic measurements in advanced heart failure [^c22978e9]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion is present in 50% to 80% of patients with acute heart failure, depending on image modality. We aim to describe the association between the presence and size of pleural effusion and central hemodynamics, including pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in an advanced heart failure population.

Methods

An observational, cross-sectional study in a cohort of patients with advanced heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%) who underwent right heart catheterization at The Department of Cardiology at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, between January 1, 2002 and October 31, 2020. The presence and size of pleural effusion were determined by a semiquantitative score of chest x -rays or computed tomography scans performed within 2 days of right heart catheterization.

Results

In 346 patients (50 ± 13 years; 78% males) with median left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% (15–25), we identified 162 (47%) with pleural effusion. The pleural effusion size was medium in 38 (24%) and large in 30 (19%). Patients with pleural effusion had a 4.3 mmHg (2.5–6.1) higher PCWP and 2.4 mmHg (1.2–3.6) higher central venous pressure (P < 0.001 for both). Patients with a medium/large pleural effusion had statistically significantly higher filling pressures than patients with a small effusion. Higher PCWP (odds ratio [OR], 1.06 [1.03–1.10]) and central venous pressure (OR, 1.09 [1.05–1.15]) were associated with pleural effusion in multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and heart failure medications (P < 0.001 for both). In a subgroup of 204 (63%) patients with serum albumin data, PCWP (OR, 1.06 [1.01–1.11]; P = 0.032), central venous pressure (OR, 1.14 [1.06–1.23]; P < 0.001) and serum albumin level (OR, 0.89 [0.83–0.95]; P < 0.001) were independently associated with the presence of a medium/large-sized pleural effusion.

Conclusions

In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% undergoing right heart catheterization as part of advanced heart failure work-up, pleural effusion was associated with higher PCWP and central venous pressure and lower serum albumin.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions have a major impact on the cardiorespiratory system. This article reviews the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions and pleural drainage, their relationship with breathlessness, and highlights key knowledge gaps.

Recent Findings

The basis for breathlessness in pleural effusions and relief following thoracentesis is not well understood. Many existing studies on the pathophysiology of breathlessness in pleural effusions are limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous design and a lack of direct measurements of respiratory muscle function. Gas exchange worsens with pleural effusions and improves after thoracentesis. Improvements in ventilatory capacity and lung volumes following pleural drainage are small, and correlate poorly with the volume of fluid drained and the severity of breathlessness. Rather than lung compression, expansion of the chest wall, including displacement of the diaphragm, appears to be the principle mechanism by which the effusion is accommodated. Deflation of the thoracic cage and restoration of diaphragmatic function after thoracentesis may improve diaphragm effectiveness and efficiency, and this may be an important mechanism by which breathlessness improves. Effusions do not usually lead to major hemodynamic changes, but large effusions may cause cardiac tamponade and ventricular diastolic collapse. Patients with effusions can have impaired exercise capacity and poor sleep quality and efficiency.

Summary

Pleural effusions are associated with abnormalities in gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, respiratory muscle function and hemodynamics, but the association between these abnormalities and breathlessness remains unclear. Prospective studies should aim to identify the key mechanisms of effusion-related breathlessness and predictors of improvement following pleural drainage.

Purpose of review

Pleural effusions have a major impact on the cardiorespiratory system. This article reviews the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions and pleural drainage, their relationship with breathlessness, and highlights key knowledge gaps.

Recent findings

The basis for breathlessness in pleural effusions and relief following thoracentesis is not well understood. Many existing studies on the pathophysiology of breathlessness in pleural effusions are limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous design and a lack of direct measurements of respiratory muscle function. Gas exchange worsens with pleural effusions and improves after thoracentesis. Improvements in ventilatory capacity and lung volumes following pleural drainage are small, and correlate poorly with the volume of fluid drained and the severity of breathlessness. Rather than lung compression, expansion of the chest wall, including displacement of the diaphragm, appears to be the principle mechanism by which the effusion is accommodated. Deflation of the thoracic cage and restoration of diaphragmatic function after thoracentesis may improve diaphragm effectiveness and efficiency, and this may be an important mechanism by which breathlessness improves. Effusions do not usually lead to major hemodynamic changes, but large effusions may cause cardiac tamponade and ventricular diastolic collapse. Patients with effusions can have impaired exercise capacity and poor sleep quality and efficiency.

Summary

Pleural effusions are associated with abnormalities in gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, respiratory muscle function and hemodynamics, but the association between these abnormalities and breathlessness remains unclear. Prospective studies should aim to identify the key mechanisms of effusion-related breathlessness and predictors of improvement following pleural drainage.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^936f88b3]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Interstitial fluid and pulmonary oedema

Quantification of B-lines (vertical artefacts that result from an increase in interstitial density; FIG. 1b) has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis, monitoring, and risk assessment of patients with known or suspected AHF –. Either curvilinear or phased array transducers can be used, typically at an imaging depth of 18 cm. Although the assessment of eight or more anterior and lateral thoracic zones (four on each hemithorax) has been recommended in a consensus statement, a subsequent study demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with examination of only six thoracic regions. The visualization of three or more B-lines in two or more intercostal spaces bilaterally should be considered diagnostic for pulmonary oedema, with sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 81–98%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI 84–96%). By contrast, physical examination and chest radiography have a sensitivity of only 62% (95% CI 61–64%) and 57% (95% CI 55–59%), and a specificity of 68% (95% CI 67–69%) and 89% (95% CI 88–90%) for a diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, respectively. The presence of multiple bilateral B-lines in AHF has been well-correlated with natriuretic peptide levels, and only variably correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and measures of extravascular lung water. Given that studies to assess the incremental diagnostic value of LUS compared with natriuretic peptides for the identification of AHF in patients with dyspnoea reported variable results in different cohorts, this topic warrants further investigation. The number of B-lines is thought to decrease with treatment for AHF and, therefore, this technique is potentially useful in the monitoring of pulmonary oedema in response to therapy. For serial assessments, patient positioning (sitting versus supine) should be kept consistent. Importantly, a higher number of B-lines on LUS at the time of discharge from hospital might help to identify patients with heart failure who have a worse prognosis.

Pleural effusion

Similarly to B-lines, the presence of pleural effusions can be assessed using curvilinear or phased array transducers in the posterior–axillary line(FIG. 1d). Current data regarding the diagnostic utility of pleural effusions identified on ultrasonography in patients with AHF are less robust, but have been reported with sensitivities of 79–84% and specificities of 83–98% in small studies of patients with dyspnoea.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^faed7e14]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The study has limitations. Unblinded interventional trials carry a risk of bias, and the primary outcome measure should be chosen carefully. The primary outcome in TAP-IT, DAOH for 90 days, is clinically relevant and reasonably unbiased. Still, we cannot rule out that the unblinded nature of the trial could have affected the physician's incentive to discharge or to readmit. Furthermore, there is a risk of bias in patient-reported outcomes with overestimation of the effect of the intervention. Patient-reported quality of life is subject to survivor bias and attrition bias resulting from survey nonresponse, which primarily occurs in participants with compromised health status. In a frail study population with a high cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disease burden, this is a potential risk. We observed a greater variation in the primary outcome than anticipated, which reduced our statistical power to detect smaller or moderate differences between the groups, likely decreasing the statistical power from the expected 90%.

We do not have data on the completeness of decongestion or drainage; no protocolized decongestion assessment was used, and control imaging to assess the effect of decongestive treatment or thoracentesis is not performed routinely unless complications to thoracentesis are suspected. The median volume drained in TAP-IT was comparable to previous observational data, in which thoracentesis was associated with long-lasting symptom relief in stable outpatients with diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure and moderate to severe pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed within a median of 22 hours, which was as expected, because half of the participants received anticoagulant therapy requiring a pause for up to 2 days before the procedure; in exploratory subgroup analysis, we found no numeric trend toward reduction in the length of the index admission in participants not on anticoagulant therapy. In a pragmatic trial, the results reflect not only the procedure but also the logistics around it at the participating sites. However, the volume drained by thoracentesis and the time to procedure reasonably represent what is experienced in the clinical setting. In addition, the results from this sample population may not be extrapolated to a younger population with heart failure as single morbidity, and the limited sample size does not allow conclusions based on subgroup analysis, including sex differences.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^5de689dc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion often develops in patients with thoracic or systemic diseases. Such effusion has traditionally been classified as transudate or exudate based on the etiology and underlying pathology, and differentiating the two types of pleural effusion is critical for guiding treatment. Transudates are usually taken as a sign of underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis, which then becomes the focus of treatment. Because in the case of a transudate, aetiology and therapy are directed to the underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Alternatively, exudates are usually taken as a sign of, inflammatory disorders or malignancy, leading to more extensive diagnostic procedures.

The criteria most widely used to differentiate exudates and transudates in patients with pleural effusions are Light's criteria, established by Light et al. in 1972. These criteria rely on levels of total protein and of lactate dehydrogenase. The criteria maximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity: they typically identify 98% of pleural exudates, but they misclassify approximately 25% of transudates as exudates. As a result, patients misclassified with exudate undergo unnecessary and risky invasive diagnostic procedures, such as thoracoscopic pleural biopsy and image-guided percutaneous pleural biopsy. This highlights the need to develop better methods to differentiate exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Since Light's criteria were published in 1972, pleural cholesterol levels have been explored for their usefulness in diagnosing pleural exudates. Cellular degeneration and vascular leakage due to increased permeability are thought to elevate pleural cholesterol levels. Several studies suggest that pleural cholesterol is increased in pleural exudates, making it a potential biomarker for differentiating exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether pleural cholesterol levels can provide adequate differentiating power, and other studies have explored the diagnostic potential of the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) and come to similarly conflicting conclusions. To help gain more reliable insights, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol level or the P/S cholesterol ratio to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^d855c5a2]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) — common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (> 2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into "at risk" and "pre-HF" is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.

### Does this patient have an exudative pleural effusion? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^e1e40a6e]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thoracentesis is performed to identify the cause of a pleural effusion. Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

Objective

To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence.

Data Sources

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies).

Results

The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1–250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8–46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5–38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein > 0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02–0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08–1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06–5.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.

### Uniportal VATS pleural biopsy in the diagnosis of exudative pleural effusion: awake or intubated? [^5a03229b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions may develop in many different conditions and the most common causes in developed countries are congestive heart failure, pneumonia and malignancy, respectively. It is estimated that 1.5 million patients suffer from pleural effusion per year. To determine the etiology of pleural fluid, firstly, biochemical, cytological and microbiological analysis of the fluid is required by thoracentesis; however, this procedure allows diagnosis in only about 75–60% of cases. The second step diagnostic procedure in negative pleural effusions of unknown causes is conventional 'blind' pleural biopsy, i.e. non-image guided pleural biopsy. This procedure is inexpensive, easy to apply and still used in many institutions. The use of 'blind' pleural biopsy increases the diagnostic efficiency of malignant pleural fluid cytology by 7–27%. However, 20–40% of patients with exudative pleural effusion cannot be diagnosed by recurrent thoracentesis and 'blind' pleural biopsy. Image guided (computed tomography or ultrasound) pleural biopsy has been shown to have a diagnostic efficiency of 76–85% in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions.

### Concurrent pericardial and pleural effusions: a double jeopardy [^f41e6ffe]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old man with large malignant pleural and pericardial effusions with tamponade physiology and signs of congestive heart failure presented for emergent subxiphoid pericardial window. Surgical drainage of the pericardium was complicated by a paradoxical cardiovascular collapse that failed to respond to pressors and intravenous fluids. Suspecting a pericardial perforation, a median sternotomy was performed and revealed an intact heart. The arterial pressure was promptly restored after drainage of the pleural effusion. It is proposed that, in patients presenting with tamponading pericardial and pleural effusions, drainage of the pleural effusion be given priority. The pathophysiology of low cardiac output states resulting from pericardial and large pleural effusion is discussed and the literature reviewed.

### The diagnostic value of chest X-ray scanning by the help of artificial intelligence in heart failure (ART-IN-HF) [^215b53dc]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Based on the eligibility criteria, anonymous chest X‐rays of 10 100 patients were uploaded on the qure.ai platform. Figure 1 showed qXR generated output using chest X‐ray. AI scanned all these X‐rays and detected 183 patients (1.8%) with increased CTR and pleural effusion on their chest X‐rays. To confirm these findings, we invited all 183 patients to the cardiology clinic for definitive HF diagnostic tests but 106 of them accepted to undergo diagnostics tests. Out of 106 patients, about 77% (82) were diagnosed with HF according to the 2021 ESC HF guidelines. We then analyzed the data of the remaining 9917 subjects without increased CTR and pleural effusion on their chest X‐rays. We randomly selected 106 subjects among them and found that nine of these 106 subjects (8%) were diagnosed with HF (Figure 2).

Figure 1
The first chest X‐ray (left side) shows the qXR‐generated output of an HF case. It has secondary capture where AI has marked the abnormality on the X‐ray. In this X‐ray, there is an enlargement of the heart and also shows a pleural effusion. Secondary capture localized the pleural effusion on the X‐ray which is marked by a circle. This makes it easy for the clinicians reading the X‐ray to locate and quantify the effusion. Secondary capture and marking help clinicians to locate the abnormalities and quicker diagnosis of HF. These abnormalities can be followed over time through sequential X‐rays, and the changes can be tracked. Since there are findings (e.g. pleural effusion) in the chest X‐ray, the qXR has labeled the X‐ray as "abnormal". The second X‐ray (X‐ray on the right side) shows an enlarged heart which is one of the signs of HF. HF, heart failure.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^b6e3f1f2]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several medical conditions are responsible for pleural effusion (PLEFF), with volume overload, congestive heart failure, and pleuropulmonary infection representing the most common causes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fluid accumulation can take place due to an imbalance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the lung capillaries, increased pleural membrane capillary permeability, and lymphatic obstruction. Furthermore, the factors known to promote lung edema formation in the clinical setting (fluid loading, myocardial depression, hypoalbuminemia) usually coexist, and may exceed the normally high absorptive capacity of the lungs and parietal pleural lymphatics, resulting in exacerbation of PLEFF.

PLEFF occurs frequently in ICU patients with an incidence that varies according to the diagnostic technique used (from 8% following physical examination to more than 60% after routine imaging). It is also associated with a high crude mortality rate. Indeed, PLEFF can worsen gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory dynamics. Drainage can improve oxygenation, respiratory mechanics, and compliance by enhancing the ventilation:perfusion ratio and by re-expanding areas of collapsed parenchymal lung. Although percutaneous pleural drain insertion is frequently carried out in the ICU, inaccurate insertion of the tube can have tragic consequences. Complications with the insertion of chest drains have been reported in up to 20–30% of cases; some of these complications can be potentially fatal (i.e. perforation of the lung, heart, liver, esophagus, spleen, and inferior vena cava).

Prompt diagnosis of the presence and nature of PLEFF is vital in order to evaluate the best therapeutic choice (diuretics, invasive procedures). The use of thoracic ultrasound (TUS), a safe and non-invasive bedside procedure with good accuracy, can help clinicians to visualize the effusion and also to distinguish between different types (exudative, transudative empyema, hemothorax). Moreover, TUS is important during thoracentesis and the insertion of chest drains as it helps increase safety and decrease life-threatening complications (e.g. organ laceration and infection). It is fundamental not only during needle or drainage insertion, but also when monitoring the volume of PLEFF drained, and deciding when to remove the drainage tube. Furthermore, TUS can help diagnose co-existing lung diseases, often with higher specificity and sensitivity than chest radiography and without X-ray exposure. Consequently, TUS has become an essential skill for many specialists, especially intensivists.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^6ce63b73]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnosis requires "symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional abnormality" corroborated by at least one of: "elevated natriuretic peptides" or "objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion". HFpEF-specific considerations include "EF 50% or greater", "Lower levels of natriuretic peptides relative to HFrEF for a given elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure", and that "Higher BMI (prevalent in HFpEF) is inversely associated with natriuretic peptide levels". When using natriuretic peptides, ambulatory thresholds are "BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL", and hospitalized thresholds are "BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 300 pg/mL". As a complementary reference, the Framingham HF Diagnostic Criteria state that "Two or more major criteria or 1 major criterion plus 2 minor criteria are strictly required to make the diagnosis", with major criteria including "orthopnea, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, rales, S3 gallop rhythm, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly", and minor criteria including "dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal cough, ankle edema, tachycardia with heart rate over 120 beats per minute, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion".

Sclerosing mesenteritis is a rare inflammatory disease of the small bowel mesentery, and has once previously been reported as a cause of chylothorax. We present the case of an 81-year-old man with a right-side transudative chylothorax associated with congestive heart failure and sclerosing mesenteritis. We discuss potential mechanisms.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^293e2ae3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^886e2ae1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is difficult to suggest a threshold level for pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP since the studies used varying threshold levels. The average pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP level in the studies was 6140 pg/mL. Six of the studies used a threshold level between 1457 to 1714 pg/mL (sensitivity and specificity for a threshold level of 1457 pg/mL by ROC analysis in the study by Bayram et al was 84% and 98%, respectively). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of these six studies is 95% (95% CI: 91–98) and 95% (95% CI: 89–98), respectively, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 370 (95% CI: 101–1351). As a result, a threshold level of approximately ≥ 1500 pg/mL provides very good diagnostic accuracy for pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP.

The utility of NT-pro-BNP for the diagnosis of pleural effusions of cardiac origin can be applied to several clinical situations. First, if the pre-test probability of a pleural effusion due to heart failure is high and alternative diagnoses are less likely, then a thoracentesis can be avoided and an elevated serum NT-pro-BNP level will be diagnostic for a cardiac origin of the pleural effusion. Second, if the pre-test probability of a pleural effusion due to heart failure is low or alternative diagnoses are considered in addition to heart failure, then a thoracentesis should be performed and if the pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP level is high then this would be diagnostic of heart failure as one potential cause for the pleural effusion. Furthermore, in undiagnosed pleural effusions, for example when Light's criteria misclassify transudative CHF effusions as exudates and the pre-test probability is equivocal for CHF, a high pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP would also be diagnostic.

### Frequency of pleural effusions in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases [^3b93f118]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions frequently accumulate in patients with left-sided heart failure. However, our recent study in patients with idiopathic and heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) demonstrated that pleural effusions frequently occur in patients with isolated right-sided heart failure (RHF). The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of pleural effusions in patients with PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD).

Methods

We retrospectively studied consecutive patients with PAH associated with CTD who were treated in the Vanderbilt Pulmonary Vascular Center. Pleural effusions were identified by chest radiograph, chest CT scan, thoracic ultrasonography, or autopsy.

Results

Thirty-five of 89 patients (39.3%) with PAH associated with CTD had pleural effusions: 23 of 51 (45.1%) with scleroderma, six of 16 (37.5%) with systemic lupus erythematosus, five of 18 (27.8%) with mixed connective tissue disease, and one of two (50.0%) with Sjögren syndrome. There were alternative explanations for the pleural effusions in six of these patients. Of the 29 patients without alternative explanation for their pleural effusions, 28 had RHF. When compared with the patients without pleural effusions, the 29 patients with pleural effusions had significantly higher mean right atrial pressures (11.3 ± 5.1 mm Hg vs 8.3 ± 4.0 mm Hg, P = 0.004) and lower cardiac indices (2.1 ± 0.6 L/min/m(2) vs 2.5 ± 0.7 L/min/m(2), P = 0.011). The pleural effusions were predominantly trace to small (58.6%) in size and bilateral (51.7%) in distribution.

Conclusions

Pleural effusions frequently accumulate in patients with PAH associated with CTD and are associated with RHF.

### A practical approach to pseudoexudative pleural effusions [^7461f48d]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Light's criteria falsely label a significant number of effusions as exudates. Such exudative effusions with transudative etiologies are referred to as "pseduoexudates". In this review, we discuss a practical approach to correctly classify an effusion that may be a pseudoexudate. A PubMed search yielded 1996 manuscripts between 1990 and 2022. Abstracts were screened and 29 relevant studies were included in this review article. Common etiologies for pseudoexudates include diuretic therapy, traumatic pleural taps, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Here, we explore alternative diagnostic criteria. Concordant exudates (CE), defined as effusions where proteins in pleural fluid/serum (PF/SPr) > 0.5 and pleural fluid LDH level of > 160 IU/L (> 2/3 upper limit of normal) confer higher predictive value to the Light's criteria. Serum-pleural effusion albumin gradient (SPAG) > 1.2 g/dL and serum-pleural effusion protein gradient (SPPG) > 3.1 g/dL together yielded a sensitivity of 100% in heart failure and a sensitivity of 99% in hepatic hydrothorax whe n identifying pseudoexudates (Bielsa et al., 2012) [5]. Pleural fluid N-Terminal Pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTPBNP) offered a specificity and sensitivity of 99% in identifying pseudoexudates when using a cut-off of > 1714 pg/mL (Han et al., 2008) [24]. However, its utility remains questionable. Additionally, we also looked at pleural fluid cholesterol and imaging modalities such as ultrasound and CT scan to measure pleural thickness and nodularity. Finally, the diagnostic algorithm we suggest involves using SPAG > 1.2 g/dL and SPPG > 3.1 g/dL in effusions classified as exudates when there is a strong clinical suspicion for pseudoexudates.

### Recurrent brachiocephalic vein stenosis as a cause for persistent left-sided transudative pleural effusion in a hemodialysis patient [^a195dc72]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Effusion is common in dialysis patients. The most common causes include fluid overload due to renal failure and nonrenal causes like congestive heart failure and infection. We here report a case of left side transudative effusion due to brachiocephalic venous stenosis.

Methods

A 34-year-old female who had chronic kidney disease V during transplant work-up was found to be having left arm swelling and left transudative effusion. Work-up for transudative effusion did not show any cardiac cause or liver problem. Her dialysis duration was optimized from 2 times a week to 3 times a week for 4 hr and her dry weight was adjusted. Despite adequate dialysis for 1 month, effusion on the left side persisted. She had a previous venoplasty for a stenosis in brachiocephalic vein but restenosis occurred again.

Results

Brachiocephalic vein stenting was performed which successfully lead to resolution of left arm swelling and left effusion. She was later on successfully transplanted.

Conclusions

Brachiocephalic stenosis can cause ipsilateral transudative effusion. Venoplasty and stenting of the brachiocephalic vein lead to complete resolution of effusion.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with nonmalignant pleural effusions: a retrospective cohort study [^a2f78ecc]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusion (PE) is a common clinical manifestation in hospitalized patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It affects more than 3,000 people per million population each year. Nonmalignant pleural effusions (NMPE) are usually associated with organ dysfunction such as pneumonia and heart failure.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome of complex etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to abrupt loss of renal function. Hospital acquired AKI (HA-AKI) is reported to happen in 9.1% patients that not only associated with short-term adverse outcomes, but also has a long-term negative impact on survival. Even mild AKI is considered to be an independent predictor of various adverse outcomes.

Large effusions can lead to a number of pathophysiological changes such as hypoxia and hemodynamic compromise putting patients at risk of AKI. What's more, Siniorakis et al. hypothesized a pleurorenal interaction, suggesting that neurohormonal derangements occur in PE patients, leading to renal hemodynamic alterations and AKI. However, the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with NMPE is not well understood and there are few data on the relationship between effusion volume and AKI. Therefore, we conducted a large cohort of consecutive patients based on the electronic medical record (EMR) to determine the incidence of AKI in NMPE and its association with the size of effusion in hospitalized NMPE patients.

### Pleural effusions in systemic amyloidosis [^5e4fb1b1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Large, recurrent pleural effusions in systemic amyloidoses are rare but clinically challenging events predominantly affecting patients with primary systemic amyloidosis. Examining the mechanisms by which these effusions form and persist offers perspective on the pathophysiology and basis for therapeutic interventions.

Recent Findings

Between 1977 and 2003, the literature consisted of approximately 21–25 case reports on pleural effusions in systemic amyloidosis. In 2003, Boston University published a retrospective single-center analysis of 35 primary systemic amyloidosis patients with large, refractory pleural effusions. To define the role of cardiomyopathy in large, refractory pleural effusions, the Boston University Amyloid Program compared demographics, pleural fluid chemistries, echocardiographic indices, and renal function measures of the pleural effusion group with data from 120 primary systemic amyloidosis cardiomyopathy patients with no pleural effusions. Neither cardiomyopathy nor nephrotic syndrome explained pleural effusions in primary systemic amyloidosis patients. The large number of exudative effusions supported primary disruption of the pleural surface and its function by amyloid. Disease mechanisms, natural history, and management options are discussed here.

Summary

Large pleural effusions in systemic amyloidosis occur most often in primary systemic amyloidosis, predominantly resulting from direct infiltration of the parietal pleural surface. Left atrial hypertension from primary systemic amyloidosis cardiomyopathy contributes to but is not sufficient to form and sustain these effusions. Untreated patients have a median survival of 1.6 months. Secondary, familial, and senile systemic amyloidosis do not infiltrate the pleural surfaces or induce pleural effusions in a clinically significant fashion.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^4090e797]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Diagnoses made on pleural biopsy

The 44.3% of patients with malignant pleuritis is in the range of other studies (60.0%, 54.0%, 44.2%, 36.6%). Of course this also depends on previous diagnostic work up before thoracoscopy (eg, imaging, number of thoracentesis, closed pleural biopsy), but also on your patient population, and if the data were collected in TB-endemic countries. We have a higher percentage of nonspecific pleuritis compared with these other studies, and lower percentage of other benign conditions. We however have no empyema, haemothorax nor heart failure, which is prevalent in some other studies. Neither do we have (clinical) probable diagnoses, but only certain diagnoses, and we categorised all these uncertain diagnoses as nonspecific pleuritis.

### Chronic pancreatitis with bochdalek hernia causing right-sided pleural effusion in a previously asymptomatic adult [^540856fb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions can occur from numerous aetiologies and are characterised as transudative or exudative in nature. Transudative effusions tend to occur in conditions that either decrease plasma oncotic pressure or increase capillary pressure (ie, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic kidney disease and pulmonary embolism). Exudative effusions typically occur from conditions that decrease the lymphatic flow from the pleural surface or increase the permeability of the pleura (ie, pneumonia, malignancy, pancreatitis, empyema and chylothorax). Chronic pancreatitis is an atypical cause of pleural effusions. Acute pancreatitis can commonly cause pleural effusions in up to 17% of patients; however, in chronic pancreatitis, pleural effusions are rarely seen. In particular, pancreaticopleural fistulas (PPFs) are seen in about 0.4% of patients who present with pancreatitis, and pseudocysts are found in 43%–79% of PPF cases.

A Bochdalek hernia is a particular type of congenital PPF that occurs due to lack of appropriate fusion of the posterior foramina of the diaphragm during embryonic development, causing a hernia to occur where the pleuroperitoneal membrane does not form. This occurs in about 1 in 2500 births, is more common in males, and is usually diagnosed incidentally with chronic symptoms typically of abdominal pain and less commonly of dyspnoea or pulmonary disease. About 80%–90% of Bochdalek hernias are found on the left side because the right pleuroperitoneal canal usually closes earlier in development. There are currently fewer than 100 cases of Bochdalek hernia reported in adults in the literature, and only about 20 cases involving right-sided hernias, making this case a very unique presentation of pleural effusion secondary to chronic pancreatitis with a Bochdalek hernia.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^3a71a21f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pericardial effusions are primarily categorized into inflammatory and non-inflammatory cases. This classification and the severity of the conditions determine the therapeutic plan. An essential consideration in understanding the epidemiology of the disease is the geographical region and country of residence. Not all pericardial effusions require evaluation to determine the cause. In developed countries, they are mainly categorized as idiopathic, believed to be associated with temporary viral infections. The second and third most common reasons are diagnosed diseases and malignancies. Conversely, in developing countries, tuberculosis remains the primary cause of the disease. These epidemiological factors can assist health decision-makers in approaching disease prevention and treatment. On a smaller scale, they empower physicians to make informed decisions for patient treatment when there is insufficient time to investigate the cause of pericardial effusion or when such investigation is not rationalized based on cost–benefit considerations. History, physical examination, and echocardiography constitute the main pillars of diagnosis. Treatment can range from observation to percutaneous or surgical procedures depending on the etiology and severity of fluid accumulation.

### Pleural and pericardial effusions as prognostic factors in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a multicenter study [^6a6e84c4]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the prognostic relevance of pleural and pericardial effusion in patients with acute PE in a German multicenter study. The main finding is that the presence of pleural effusion alone is a prognostic factor in patients with acute PE. The present analysis is one of the largest to date on this topic.

Acute PE is associated with a significant mortality, with reported short-term mortality of up to 20%. The most established prognostic factor is systolic blood pressure. Risk stratification is also mainly based on systolic blood pressure. Other important aspects include cardiac injury with blood parameters, age over 70 years, history of bed rest for more than five days, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and tachycardia.

Risk stratification of acute PE is very important for treatment planning. Patients with low-risk PE can be treated with anticoagulation in most cases, whereas patients with severe PE may require mechanical revascularization.

An important aspect of the present analysis is that only the presence of pleural effusion carries prognostic information, whereas quantification by width or density does not carry additional relevant information. At first glance, this seems to contradict clinical routine. Possible confounding factors could be that the volume of the pleural or pericardial effusion is highly variable during the course of the patient's illness. Moreover, both may be confounded by previous drainage treatment, which could not be accounted for in the present analysis. The exact timing of CT seems to be crucial for correct volumetry and Hounsfield measurement, which may be too heterogeneous in the present cohort.

Nevertheless, this result of the present analysis is of interest because it only reports the presence, which could be easily performed in clinical routine without the need for more complex measurements by the radiologist.

### Biomarkers of heart failure in pleural fluid [^28d39c53]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) and ST2, which are biomarkers of myocyte stress, for diagnosing pleural effusions due to heart failure (HF). BNP and ST2 have not been previously evaluated in pleural fluid.

Methods

The three biomarkers were measured in the pleural fluid of 90 cardiac effusions and 91 noncardiac effusions by commercially available methodologies. The area under the curve (AUC) quantified the overall diagnostic accuracy of the tests.

Results

Pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP, BNP, and ST2 demonstrated AUCs of 0.96, 0.90 and 0.59, respectively, for diagnosing effusions due to HF. The cutoff values of 1,300 and 115 pg/mL, respectively, for NT-pro-BNP and BNP had the best discriminating properties. The reference level for BNP was particularly accurate in men > 75 years of age (AUC, 0.98), but age, gender, and serum creatinine level did not influence the NT-pro-BNP levels. Of the 20 patients whose cardiac effusions were misclassified as exudates by the criteria of Light et al, 18 patients (90%) and 14 patients (70%), respectively, would have been correctly categorized by NT-pro-BNP and BNP, whereas only 10 patients (50%) would have been appropriately classified by the serum-pleural protein gradient.

Conclusions

The pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP level is very useful in establishing the diagnosis of HF-associated effusions, and it confirms this diagnosis better than pleural BNP levels. The measurement of NT-pro-BNP rather than the serum-to-pleural protein gradient is recommended for identifying mislabeled cardiac transudates. The pleural fluid ST2 level is not helpful in diagnosing HF.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^eb7e7ba8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a relatively common complication associated with inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases. The primary etiology of this condition could be considered when choosing therapeutic options and factors such as effusion size and its hemodynamic consequence. In most cases, small to moderate pericardial effusions can be managed with observation and anti-inflammatory medications unless the effusion develops rapidly. However, in a small proportion of patients, large effusions lead to impaired cardiac filling with hemodynamic compromise and cardiovascular collapse due to cardiac tamponade. The rate at which fluid accumulates is the primary determinant of hemodynamic impact and thus guides the choice of treatment, irrespective of the effusion's size. Severe cases are typically treated with pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance. More aggressive treatments may be necessary for cases due to purulent or malignant etiologies. These cases may require a pericardial window to allow for long-term drainage of the pericardial fluid. This comprehensive review focuses on the epidemiology of pericardial effusion and discusses pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options for different causes of secondary pericardial effusions.

### Incidence of pleural effusions in idiopathic and familial pulmonary arterial hypertension patients [^47ebaa4b]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion occurs often in patients with left heart failure. There are no large-scale clinical studies investigating the incidence of pleural effusion in patients with right heart failure (RHF) alone.

Objectives

To determine the incidence of pleural effusions in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH).

Methods

Consecutive IPAH and FPAH patients who were treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center were retrospectively studied. Pleural effusions were detected by chest radiograph, chest CT scan, ultrasound, or autopsy.

Results

Thirty-one of 147 patients (21.1%) with IPAH (128 patients) or FPAH (19 patients) had pleural effusions. Ten patients had explanations for the pleural effusions other than RHF. Two patients had no obvious explanations. The remaining 19 patients had RHF. When compared with the patients without pleural effusions, the patients with pleural effusions due to RHF had significantly higher mean right atrial pressure (16.0 ± 6.8 vs 8.8 ± 5.5 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in other hemodynamic parameters between the two patient groups. The majority of effusions due to RHF are trace to small (63.2%) and right sided (57.9%) or bilateral (26.3%). Of the 19 patients with pleural effusions due to RHF, 8 patients had ascites, and 1 patient had moderate pericardial effusion. Four of the five patients who underwent thoracentesis had transudates.

Conclusions

Our study in IPAH and FPAH patients demonstrates that pleural effusions frequently occur in patients with isolated RHF.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^5a66356d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure

Approximately 12–20% of heart failure (HF) cases can be accompanied by pericardial effusions. Branches of the internal mammary arteries and the musculophrenic arteries provide arterial supply to the pericardium. Venous drainage of the pericardium is via the pericardiophrenic vein, which empties into the internal thoracic vein, the left superior intercostal vein, or directly into the left brachiocephalic vein.

Fluid can accumulate in the pericardium space due to increased venous pressure. Conditions such as HF and cirrhosis can cause congestion of venous returns, dysfunction of lymphatic drainage, and decreased fluid reabsorption, which can finally result in pericardial effusion. Since these patients experience chronic fluid accumulation in the pericardium space, they are mostly asymptomatic, and PE diagnosis occurs as an incidental finding during evaluation for other reasons.

Pulmonary hypertension

With the same mechanism, the pressure on the right ventricle will also be raised when the PAP is increased. This pathologic condition is called PAH and is one of the five groups of pulmonary hypertension. PAH can be divided into two subgroups: Idiopathic PAH, which is caused without any known specific reason, and secondary PAH, due to connective tissue disorders, HIV, and other reasons. It has been shown that echocardiographic features such as right ventricle dysfunction and moderate and severe PE presence can be associated with a higher mortality rate. PAH can be accompanied by fluid accumulation in the pericardial space, lack of appropriate drainage by the reabsorbing system, and various degrees of PEs. The treatment of PE in these cases depends on the cause of increased PE, and there is a wide inconsistency between the results of various studies. Those with primary PAH will benefit from medications that can decrease this pressure, such as sildenafil and bosentan; anti-inflammatory medications may reduce inflammation and improve rheumatologic causes. Some evidence emphasizes the better outcome of transcatheter drainage of pericardial effusion. The medical team should decide based on the patient's condition and after considering all therapeutic strategies.

### Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with pleural effusions: preliminary observations [^cf0803fa]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To address the value of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations as a diagnostic tool for determining the cardiac etiology of pleural effusions, and to determine possible differences of plasma BNP concentrations before and after pleurocentesis in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital.

Patients

Consecutive series of 64 patients with indications for diagnostic pleurocentesis. The final diagnosis of the underlying disease was assessed by clinical criteria. Seven patients were excluded due to pleural effusions of equivocal origin or due to obvious hemothorax secondary to trauma.

Intervention

Pleurocentesis attempting to drain effusions dry. Plasma BNP concentrations were measured directly before pleurocentesis and 24 h after the intervention. During these 24 h, the dosages of patients' medications were held constant.

Measurements and Results

In distinguishing between patients with pleural effusions caused by CHF (n = 31) and patients with pleural effusions attributable to other causes (n = 26), the area under the curve was 0.974 (SE, 0.021; 95% confidence interval, 0.892 to 0.997) for plasma BNP. A BNP cutoff concentration of 2,201 ng/L had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 100% in the diagnosis of CHF. The median plasma BNP concentrations in patients with pleural effusions caused by CHF (n = 31) did not change within 24 h after pleurocentesis compared with the concentrations obtained before the procedure (before pleurocentesis, 3,227 ng/L; 24 h after pleurocentesis, 2,759 ng/L; p = 0.189), despite a median removal of 1,100 mL pleural fluid.

Conclusions

Plasma BNP concentrations of patients with pleural effusions of unknown origin may be an aid in the diagnosis of CHF as the underlying cause. If plasma BNP is used as a surrogate marker of global cardiac function, there is no indication of hemodynamic improvement caused by pleurocentesis alone in patients with CHF and pleural effusions.

### Pleural effusions in the intensive care unit [^a989d76f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of pleural effusions in the intensive care unit varies depending on the screening methods, from approximately 8% for physical examination to more than 60% for routine ultrasonography. Several factors contribute to the occurrence of pleural effusions in intensive care unit patients: large amounts of intravenous fluid are often administered, pneumonia is common, and heart failure, atelectasis, extravascular catheter migration, hypoalbuminemia, or liver disease are present in many intensive care unit patients. In surgical intensive care units, cardiac or abdominal surgery is often followed by pleural effusions, and in trauma patients, hemothorax is a dreaded event. Because no clinical parameter excludes pleural infection, and because of the impact of thoracentesis on diagnosis and treatment, this procedure should be performed unless contraindicated. Thoracentesis is safe in mechanically ventilated patients. The author discusses the following points regarding pleural effusions in the intensive care unit: screening intensive care unit patients for pleural effusion, safety of thoracentesis in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, distinguishing exudates from transudates, and diagnosing and managing infected pleural effusions in critically ill patients. Lastly, the author suggests a research agenda for pleural effusions in intensive care unit patients.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^dc0feb2a]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Intervention

In the intention-to-treat population, the median time from randomization to thoracentesis (n = 59) was 22 hours (3; 31; minimum 0 to maximum 97 hours). The subgroup of 29 participants who received anticoagulant therapy waited a median of 30 hours (22; 48) before the procedure. By thoracentesis, a median of 1062 mL pleural effusion (700; 1744; minimum 150 to maximum 6200 mL) was drained, and 68% of the intervention group (46 out of 68) had > 500 mL drained. In the thoracentesis group, 2 participants were not referred and planned for thoracentesis and were classified as crossovers according to the study protocol and statistical analysis plan. In adherence with the protocol, 7 participants (10%) in the thoracentesis group did not undergo the procedure because the performing physician did not find an effusion large enough for safe catheter placement. This group waited a median of 48 hours (32; 59); only 3 were on anticoagulant therapy. Five participants (8%) in the control group underwent thoracentesis (one had 2 procedures attributable to complications) during the index admission because they developed an indication for a diagnostic puncture, experienced clinical deterioration, or had an insufficient treatment response after 5 days. All were in adherence to the protocol. This ultimately resulted in an as-treated population of 64 participants (47%) having thoracentesis performed and 71 (53%) treated with standard pharmacological therapy only during the index admission (Figure 1). Detailed descriptions of the indications or reasons for refraining from thoracentesis are listed in.

### Indwelling pleural catheters for non-malignant pleural effusions: report on a single centre's 10 years of experience [^fbf9f5be]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Due to the retrospective character, the present study has several limitations. On the one hand, the data provide a deep insight into the management and follow-up of patients with IPC in NMPE, even though our data set is dominated by patients with CHF and HH and lacks patients with, for example, chronic renal failure or rheumatic diseases. On the other hand, providing a patient with an IPC or not is subject to the physician's decision and thereby source of a selection bias. Symptom-related data were not collected regularly; thus, symptom relief could only be assessed indirectly with regard to the need of subsequent invasive procedures. Moreover, the estimation of procedure-related complications may be too low as some events may have been undocumented, especially in those lost to follow-up. Finally, in patients who have received an intervention for the underlying disease, it is difficult to differentiate between real pleurodesis and only a cessation of effusion accumulation, if the organ function of these patients has conditionally improved. Nevertheless, the current study contributes to the growing body of evidence of IPC as a safe and feasible treatment option also in the management of NMPE, with the exception of patients with HH, for whom the use of an IPC needs critical consideration due to high complication rates.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^acb8a1e4]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Great progress has been made in building what is now a robust evidence base to inform a number of management strategies in MPE but nonetheless these still primarily focus on optimal drainage strategies. Over the next decade, more upstream research is needed to advance our understanding of the mechanistic drivers of MPE formation on a cellular level. Advances in immunological and intrapleural therapies pose exciting therapeutic directions that may offer targeted pharmacological treatment of MPE and it remains to be seen what effect the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies will have on the incidence of MPE. Early translational work has suggested that pleural fluid may not be an innocent bystander and may have pro-growth properties promoting cancer cell proliferation thus requiring pro-active drainage beyond palliative symptom control. As we increasingly define treatment pathways based on patient preference, there is a need for high quality qualitative data exploring the patient experience along the varied treatment strategies to inform discussions and to empower patients to make informed decisions.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with malignant pleural effusion, indwelling pleural catheter, ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing either indwelling pleural catheter placement or chemical pleurodesis as the first-line definitive intervention for the management of dyspnea in patients with malignant pleural effusion with known (or likely) suspected expandable lung and no prior definitive therapy if the patient's symptoms are attributable to the effusion.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with nonmalignant pleural effusions: a retrospective cohort study [^aa76db59]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis showed that older age was associated with a higher risk of AKI, but this effect was attenuated by lower eGFR or higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and eGFR and ACR were consistent, strong risk factors for AKI. In our study, the odds ratio of age was 1.68 (95%CI 1.49–1.92; p < 0.001) in univariate analysis, but in multivariate analysis and LASSO analysis, the odds ratio of age was attenuated with no statistically significant difference, although it was selected by LASSO analysis, which might be due to other stronger risk factors. Proteinuria and eGFR remained independent risk factors in our study. 37.5% of patients had pneumonia, so infection was a very common problem in NMPE patients if abdominal and intracranial infection were added. We found vancomycin/teicoplanin was an independent contributor to AKI with a relatively high odds ratio (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.38–2.81). The exact mechanism by which vancomycin/teicoplanin induces nephrotoxicity is unclear, which was reported to be associated with oxidative stress. Although vancomycin/teicoplanin is not the preferred anti-infective agent because of its side effects, it is one of the few antibiotics of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Clinicians should carefully monitor urine output and creatinine when using vancomycin/teicoplanin. Our results suggest that both spironolactone and loop diuretics are risk factors for AKI in multivariate analysis with a relative high odds ratio. This may be related to concomitant heart failure, renal insufficiency and cirrhosis, or reduced renal perfusion with diuretics. Therefore, a better way to use diuretics in NMPE patients needs to be further investigated. In addition, the use of NSAIDs was also an independent risk factor for HA-AKI with a high odds ratio, which may be related to the hemodynamic changes or damage to the renal interstitium from NSAIDs. In addition, uncontrolled infection causing fever or rapid volume depletion due to diaphoresis after NSAIDs use could be confounders, so NMPE patients may be at high risk when using NSAIDs and should be used cautiously or in reduced doses when it's necessary to improve symptoms. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was a predictor of AKI in many diseases. Previous studies showed that the number of comorbidities and CCI were predictors of both short-term and long-term mortality in patients with PE. We hypothesized that NMPE patients hospitalized with multiple comorbidities may have had an acute change in condition during admission leading to acute kidney injury, considering a high burden of comorbidity was quite common in NMPE patients (the median CCI was 2 in our study and 5 in the previous research). The odds ratio of CCI was 1.69 in our univariate analysis (95%CI 1.52–1.87), but was not significant after adjustment for other variables. We found that effusion volume might work as a mediator between heart failure, pneumonia or eGFR and AKI, although the effect was small. This may support our hypothesis that the volume of PE was associated with AKI. Researches have shown that in the course of progression of pneumonia-related pleural effusion, imbalance of various pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, abnormal activity of the fibrinolytic system play an important role, which have been considered as mechanisms for the development of AKI in a variety of models as well. Thus, there may be a common pathway for the development of AKI and increase of pleural effusion. Besides, we hypothesized that the mechanism of the mediating effect of effusions on heart failure and eGFR might be hemodynamic changes. The above findings of an underlying mediating effect of volume can only be considered hypothesis-generating, showing possible associations but not necessarily causal relationships. It cannot be excluded that similar changes obtained by other approaches than the volume of effusions may contribute.

### Large pleural effusion: a pitfall in the quantitation of 99m Tc-PYP imaging for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis [^a3cb337f]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR and ATTRv) is an underrecognized cause of heart failure that results from myocardial deposition of misfolded protein (TTR or prealbumin). The diagnosis can be confirmed by uptake of 99m Tc-pyrophosphate (99m Tc-PYP) in the heart with serologic studies to rule out light chain disease. We present the case of a 70-year-old woman who underwent a 99m Tc-PYP scan. The patient had a large right-sided pleural effusion that lowered counts in the right chest on planar imaging, interfered with ratio-based grading of PYP uptake, and highlighted the importance of obtaining SPECT/CT for problem-solving in cases where uptake ratios may be spurious.

### Clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of valproate-induced pleural effusion [^fd939c6d]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid derivative commonly prescribed for several types of seizure disorders or for acute manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Several cases of valproate-induced pleural effusion have been reported, although the precise pathophysiological mechanism remains unknown.

Objective

To describe the presentation of pleural effusion associated with valproate use and to categorize published case reports according to clinical, immunological, and pleural effusion cell type.

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases were systematically searched from January 1970 until November 2020 using the following search terms: "valproic acid" OR "valproate" OR "pleural fluid" OR "exudative effusion" OR "transudative effusion" OR "valproic lung adverse events". These searches yielded 171 references of which 135 articles were considered irrelevant, leaving 36 potentially relevant references which were carefully scrutinized. Twenty-eight cases of valproate-induced pleural effusion were identified after excluding two articles reporting five patients with lung parenchymal adverse reactions to treatment with valproic acid; two articles reporting three patients in whom the pleural effusion could not be attributed to valproic acid alone; one case discussing valproate therapy and fungal pleural effusion; and one describing a patient who suffered from severe cardiac failure. There were also two cases, in an abstract form, with pericardial and pleural effusion, but without any further informative details, and, thus, they were also excluded from this survey.

Exudative Eosinophilic Pleural Effusion

This was the most common type of valproate-induced pleural effusion reported in 17 out of 28 cases (60.7%), with concurrent peripheral eosinophilia in ten. Acute hypersensitivity reaction, inflammation of the pleural cavity induced by the drug, drug toxicity, and damage to mesothelial cells due to oxidants, comprise the possible pivotal mechanisms.

Exudative Lymphocytic Pleural Effusion

This was reported in two cases, with concurrent pericardial effusion in one. Discontinuation of valproate led to resolution of the effusion, although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain abstruse. Interestingly, a patient presented with recurrent pleural effusion characterized by transition from eosinophilic to lymphocytic predominance after readministration of valproate.

Transudative Pleural Effusion

Three out of 28 cases (10.7%) were characterized by neutrophilic transudative pleural effusion after long-term therapy with valproate, while concurrent pericardial effusion was also noted in two.

Valproate-Induced Lupus Erythematosus With Pleural Effusion

Five patients receiving valproate therapy (17.9% out of the 28 cases) developed drug-induced lupus erythematosus with concurrent pleural effusion that was eosinophilic in three. All patients had positive antinuclear antibodies; anti-histone antibodies were positive in two.

Conclusions

Valproate-induced pleural effusion is rare, but patients receiving treatment with valproic acid who develop respiratory symptoms should be examined for valproate-induced pleural effusion.

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^3ed5427c]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of recurrent pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that recurrent pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^82069afb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The correlation between pleural fluid and serum levels of NT-pro-BNP are high as shown by five studies in our meta-analysis (Table 2). This suggests that thoracentesis could potentially be avoided in patients with a clinical suspicion of CHF, elevated NT-pro-BNP, and no suspicion for a co-existing cause of the pleural effusion.

Most institutions use BNP to diagnose CHF. Three studies have examined the diagnostic accuracy of BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin. The first study of 57 patients showed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 89% for plasma BNP. The second study by Porcel et al (181 patients), showed a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 92% for pleural fluid BNP and also showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for NT-pro-BNP was higher than for pleural fluid BNP, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.99) vs 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86–0.95) respectively. Correlation between pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP levels and BNP levels was good, r = 0.78 (p < 0.001). The conclusion from this study was to use NT-pro-BNP rather than BNP for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin because of the diagnostic superiority of NT-pro-BNP versus BNP, greater in-vitro stability of NT-pro-BNP compared with BNP, and longer half-life of NT-pro-BNP (1–2 hours) compared with BNP (20 minutes). The last study by Long et al (80 patients) showed that the AUC for NT-pro-BNP was greater than for pleural fluid BNP, 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72–0.95) vs 0.70 (95% CI: 0.57–0.83). Correlation between pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP and BNP levels was also good but less impressive, r = 0.57 (p < 0.001), and only explained 32% of the variance in NT-pro-BNP. The conclusion from this study was that NT-pro-BNP was a more stable molecule after sample processing and could be maintained for a greater duration in an in vitro setting compared to BNP and furthermore because of the higher diagnostic accuracy of NT-pro-BNP, NT-pro-BNP should be used over BNP to distinguish pleural effusions of cardiac origin in select patient populations.

### Pleural fluid amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide in patients with pleural effusions [^6e0359ed]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Definite diagnosis of transudative or exudative pleural fluids often presents a diagnostic dilemma. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in pleural fluid has a diagnostic value for discriminating heart-failure-related pleural effusions from non-heart-failure effusions.

Methods

Sixty-six subjects (40 male, mean age 61 ± 18 y) with pleural effusions were included. Samples of pleural fluid and serum were obtained simultaneously from each subject. Biochemical analysis, bacterial and fungal culture, acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, and cytology were performed on the pleural fluid.

Results

Subjects with heart-failure-related pleural effusion had significantly higher pleural NT-proBNP levels than other subjects (P < .001). Pleural and serum NT-proBNP measures were closely correlated (r = 0.90, P < .001). An NT-proBNP cutoff value of ≥ 2,300 pg/mL in pleural fluid had a sensitivity of 70.8%, a specificity of 97.6%, and positive and negative predictive values of 94.4% and 85.4%, respectively, for discriminating transudates caused by heart failure from exudates. Eight heart-failure subjects were misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria, 5 of whom received diuretics before thoracentesis. All misclassified subjects had pleural NT-proBNP levels higher than 1,165 pg/mL, which predicted heart-failure-associated transudates with 95.8% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity.

Conclusions

Pleural fluid NT-proBNP measurement in the routine diagnostic panel may be useful in differentiation of heart-failure-related pleural effusions and exudative pleural fluids with reasonable accuracy, especially in heart-failure patients treated with diuretics.

### Indwelling pleural catheters for non-malignant pleural effusions: report on a single centre's 10 years of experience [^f9efbe1e]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Results

Between 2006 and 2017, 54 patients received 62 IPC. Thirty-two patients were male (59.3%) and 22 female (40.7%). Median age at time of catheter insertion was 68.5 years (range 32–95, IQR 56–76). The most frequent diagnoses were CHF (n = 30, 48.4%) and liver cirrhosis (n = 27, 43.5%). Recurrent postinfectious effusions were treated with an IPC in three patients. The remaining two cases were a chylothorax and one PE of unknown origin. All procedures were preceded by at least two thoracenteses or a chest tube before insertion of the IPC. Supply with an IPC following TP failure was performed in four patients (6.5%). More catheters were placed right than left sided (62.9 vs 25.8%), in 11.3% bilateral procedures were executed. All effusions due to heart failure and cirrhosis were transudates, but significant differences between those two entities in albumin/protein content and serum LDH were noted (albumin 14.1 ± 5.9 g/dL vs 7.6 ± 6.2 g/dL, p = 0.001; protein 25.2 ± 10.1 g/dL vs 14.6 ± 10.3 g/dL, p < 0.001; LDH 124.3 ± 58.2 U/L vs 93.1 ± 38.6 U/L, p = 0.027). In contrast, all postinfectious effusions were exudates. All baseline demographics are shown in table 1.

Kinetics: Pleural effusion needs long-term attention. In second-line treatment with dasatinib, the median time to appearance is 5–11 months, but it can be delayed until 3 years. In first-line use, the median time to pleural effusion was 10 months, and most effusions (89%) occurred more than 8 weeks into treatment; although the risk diminishes with time, pleural effusion can occur throughout treatment.

Predisposing conditions: In second-line use, previous or concomitant cardiac disease and hypertension seem to be the most common predisposing conditions. Also, twice daily scheduling, advanced phases, hypercholesterolaemia, a previous history of auto-immune disorders and skin rashes experienced during imatinib therapy have been identified as risk factors. Older age is also associated with pleural effusion, and in patients older than 60 years, the presence of concomitant pulmonary disease, the initial daily dose of dasatinib (140 mg vs 100 mg), and a higher comorbidity indexwere associated with pleural effusion. As well as knowing the situations that increase the risk of pleural effusion, patients and doctors must be vigilant in the presence of cough, dyspnoea or chest pain, and these symptoms should prompt a chest X-ray.

Management of pleural effusions: Management of dasatinib-related pleural effusions includes treatment suspension or reduction of the dose, with or without steroids and diuretics. In rare instances, usually of grade 3–4, more invasive measures such as thoracocentesis are necessary to resolve the effusion. Pleural effusions are potentially reversible after discontinuation of dasatinib and the administration of steroids and diuretics. They can also be recurrent. Whereas after resolution of the first episode, the drug could be resumed at the same dose, in the case of a second episode it is advisable to reduce the dose to the next lower level (for example, 80 mg from 100 mg/day). In the case of further relapses, either stepwise lowering the dose down to 50 mg/day or switching to another TKI are reasonable options. If the relapse is symptomatic, even if during the first occurrence of an effusion, switching is the preferred option. A regimen of 5 days on, 2 days off is under investigation.

Pleural effusions emerging on second-line bosutinib therapy may also occur; a similar management approach to that taken with dasatinib seems to be reasonable.

NCCN Chronic Myeloid Leukemia — dasatinib adverse effects, pleural effusion, and PAH: In DASISION, grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were higher for dasatinib than imatinib, while nonhematologic adverse events such as muscle spasms, peripheral edema, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent with imatinib. Discontinuation due to drug-related adverse events occurred in 16% with dasatinib versus 7% with imatinib. Pleural effusion was more common with dasatinib — 28% in DASISION compared to < 1% with imatinib and 33% in a dose optimization study — and was significantly reduced with dasatinib 100 mg once daily compared with 70 mg twice daily; patients with prior cardiac history, with hypertension, and receiving dasatinib 70 mg twice daily are at increased risk. Largely reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension has been reported as a rare but serious side effect; pulmonary hypertension occurred in 5% with dasatinib compared to < 1% with imatinib. Evaluation for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating and close monitoring during treatment with dasatinib is recommended; dose reduction (with close monitoring) should be considered for patients at risk of developing pleural effusions, and switching to alternate TKI is recommended for persistent pleural effusion or PAH despite supportive care and dose reduction.
