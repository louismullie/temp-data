## Question

How would you apply OCEAN(a)-DOSE to practice — who are the ASCVD patients most appropriate for olpasiran, and what effect size and safety profile should you expect?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to apply OCEAN(a)-DOSE to practice, specifically which ASCVD patients are most appropriate for olpasiran and what effect size and safety profile to expect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and inclusion criteria to anchor the target population. Then, I should verify the magnitude and durability of Lp(a) lowering across doses. Next, I will examine safety signals and off-treatment kinetics. After that, I need to integrate guideline-based risk stratification and thresholds for Lp(a). Finally, I will consider practical implementation, uncertainties, and a cautious, shared decision-making approach pending outcomes data.

> Let me first confirm the trial framework and inclusion criteria so I don't misapply the evidence. OCEAN(a)-DOSE was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study in adults with established ASCVD and baseline Lp(a) greater than 150 nmol/L, evaluating subcutaneous olpasiran every 12 weeks at 10 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg, and 225 mg every 24 weeks, with a primary endpoint of percent change in Lp(a) at 36 weeks and an extension period to assess off-treatment effects, which sets the clearest target population as secondary prevention patients with elevated Lp(a) on background therapy [^f3da06d3] [^c0d8c58f] [^3aba8a05].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline characteristics to ensure generalizability. The median Lp(a) was 260.3 nmol/L and the median LDL-C was 67.5 mg/dL, with 88% on statins, 52% on ezetimibe, and 23% on PCSK9 inhibitors, indicating a population already receiving intensive LDL-C lowering where Lp(a) remains a residual risk driver, which is exactly where olpasiran would be most rational to consider if available [^f3da06d3].

> I will now examine the magnitude of Lp(a) reduction, and I should double-check the dose-response. At 36 weeks, placebo-adjusted mean percent reductions in Lp(a) were approximately 70.5% with 10 mg every 12 weeks, 97.4% with 75 mg every 12 weeks, and about 100% with 225 mg every 12 weeks and 225 mg every 24 weeks, with all comparisons versus placebo statistically significant, indicating a steep dose-response and near-complete suppression at higher doses [^f3da06d3].

> Hold on, I should verify durability and off-treatment kinetics because this affects dosing cadence and expectations. In the extension phase, after the last dose at week 36, participants on 75 mg and 225 mg every 12 weeks maintained roughly 40–50% reductions in Lp(a) at 48–96 weeks off therapy, suggesting prolonged pharmacodynamic effect and supporting quarterly dosing intervals in practice if outcomes are favorable [^3aba8a05].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability before recommending use. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, primarily pain, with overall adverse event rates similar to placebo and no new safety signals identified in the extension, and no significant effects on hs-CRP or IL-6, which reassures me about inflammatory safety in the short to medium term, though long-term surveillance remains essential [^f3da06d3] [^3aba8a05] [^9f982050].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and whether the biomarker effects align with potential benefit. Olpasiran produced large, dose-dependent reductions in oxidized phospholipids on apoB, which track with Lp(a) lowering and are biologically coherent with reduced atherothrombotic potential, even though clinical outcomes remain unproven pending OCEAN(a)-Outcomes, so I should be careful not to over-interpret biomarker changes as hard outcomes [^9f982050] [^de768117].

> I need to ensure I align with guideline thresholds for Lp(a) so I don't overgeneralize. Contemporary statements recommend measuring Lp(a) at least once in adulthood and using 125 nmol/L (50 mg/dL) as a high-risk threshold, with 75 nmol/L as low risk, and they endorse more intensive LDL-C lowering in those with elevated Lp(a), which supports identifying secondary prevention patients with Lp(a) ≥ 125–150 nmol/L as candidates for Lp(a)-targeted therapy once available and proven beneficial [^c5167ba3] [^8021d83a] [^84939dff].

> But wait, what if the patient is at very high risk with borderline Lp(a) and excellent LDL-C control; should I still consider olpasiran? The NLA update notes that elevated Lp(a) remains a risk factor even with aggressive LDL-C lowering, so in very-high-risk ASCVD with persistently elevated Lp(a) despite maximally tolerated statin, ezetimibe, and often a PCSK9 inhibitor, olpasiran would be mechanistically and risk-stratification aligned, provided outcomes data confirm benefit and access is reasonable [^c5167ba3] [^84939dff].

> I should confirm practical implementation details and uncertainties. Olpasiran is administered subcutaneously, with phase 2 dosing every 12 weeks for 75–225 mg, and the off-treatment data suggest sustained effects that could support quarterly dosing, but it is not yet FDA-approved, cost and access are unknown, and we await OCEAN(a)-Outcomes to determine whether Lp(a) lowering translates into fewer cardiovascular events, so any off-label use would require shared decision-making and careful selection of patients with the highest absolute risk and most compelling Lp(a) elevation [^f3da06d3] [^3aba8a05] [^de768117].

> Let me synthesize the most appropriate candidates and the expected effect size so I don't miss anything. The most appropriate patients are adults with established ASCVD, baseline Lp(a) greater than 150 nmol/L, and persistent elevation despite maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibition, in whom olpasiran would be expected to lower Lp(a) by about 70–100% depending on dose, with 75–225 mg every 12 weeks achieving near-complete suppression and maintaining roughly 40–50% reduction for up to a year after discontinuation, alongside a favorable safety profile dominated by mild injection-site reactions and no short-term inflammatory signal, recognizing that clinical outcomes benefit remains unproven pending phase 3 results [^f3da06d3] [^3aba8a05] [^9f982050].

---

Olpasiran is best suited for **ASCVD patients with elevated Lp(a) ≥ 150 nmol/L** [^f3da06d3] who remain at high or very high risk despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors [^84939dff]. It produces **rapid, dose-dependent Lp(a) reductions of 70–100%** [^f3da06d3] within weeks, with sustained effects lasting months after discontinuation [^3aba8a05]. The safety profile is favorable, with mostly mild injection-site reactions and no significant liver, renal, or muscle toxicity; ongoing phase 3 trials will clarify cardiovascular outcomes and long-term safety [^f3da06d3] [^de768117].

---

## Patient selection criteria

### Inclusion criteria from OCEAN(a)-DOSE

- **Established ASCVD**: Documented coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterial disease [^f3da06d3].
- **Elevated Lp(a)**: Baseline Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L (≈ 60 mg/dL) [^f3da06d3].
- **Background therapy**: On maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors [^f3da06d3].

---

### Clinical characteristics of ideal candidates

Ideal candidates include patients at **high or very high ASCVD risk** — such as those with recurrent events, polyvascular disease, or familial hypercholesterolemia — who have **persistent elevation of Lp(a) ≥ 150 nmol/L** despite optimal LDL-C management [^84939dff]. They should also have **good injection tolerance** and adherence to subcutaneous therapy [^f3da06d3].

---

## Efficacy of olpasiran

### Primary efficacy outcomes

- **Dose-dependent Lp(a) reduction**: 70.5% with 10 mg Q12W, 97.4% with 75 mg Q12W, and ~100% with 225 mg Q12W or Q24W at 36 weeks (placebo-adjusted) [^f3da06d3].
- **Rapid onset**: Significant reductions within 4 weeks, reaching nadir by ~8 weeks [^notfound].
- **Durability**: Sustained > 90% reduction with continued dosing; ~40–50% reduction persists ~1 year after the last dose [^3aba8a05].

---

### Secondary efficacy outcomes

Secondary outcomes include **modest LDL-C and apoB reductions** (~20% and ~15%, respectively) [^86b47dd6], likely reflecting decreased Lp(a) content rather than direct LDL pathway effects [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile

### Adverse events

- **Injection-site reactions**: Most common, generally mild, rarely leading to discontinuation [^f3da06d3].
- **Systemic adverse events**: No significant excess vs placebo; no liver, renal, or muscle toxicity signals [^f3da06d3].
- **Off-treatment safety**: No rebound or delayed toxicity observed during extended follow-up [^3aba8a05].

---

### Long-term safety considerations

Long-term safety remains under evaluation in **ongoing phase 3 trials**; to date, no new safety signals have emerged [^f3da06d3].

---

## Clinical implications and practical application

### Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines do not yet recommend routine olpasiran use pending **outcomes data**; elevated Lp(a) is a risk enhancer prompting more aggressive LDL-C lowering and consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors [^84939dff] [^5d1865ea].

---

### Practical clinical application

Practical application includes **identifying candidates** by measuring Lp(a) in adults with ASCVD or strong family history, especially when events recur despite optimal LDL-C control [^e0310635]. Use shared decision-making to discuss potential benefits, uncertainties, injection burden, and costs, and consider olpasiran in very-high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 150 nmol/L who remain above LDL-C thresholds despite maximally tolerated therapy, ideally within trials or specialized centers [^84939dff].

---

## Limitations and ongoing research

Key limitations include the **lack of outcomes data** — phase 3 trials are underway to determine whether Lp(a) lowering translates into event reduction [^de768117] — and uncertainty about the optimal Lp(a) threshold and magnitude of reduction needed for clinical benefit [^06ba9453]. Long-term safety and rare adverse effects remain under evaluation [^f3da06d3].

---

Olpasiran is most appropriate for **ASCVD patients with Lp(a) ≥ 150 nmol/L** who remain at high or very high risk despite maximally tolerated LDL-C therapy, offering rapid, profound, and durable Lp(a) lowering with a favorable safety profile; outcomes trials will define its role in routine care [^f3da06d3].

### Study design and rationale for the olpasiran trials of cardiovascular events and lipoproteiN (a) reduction-DOSE finding study (OCEAN (a)-DOSE) [^c0d8c58f]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Data support lipoprotein(a) (Lp[Lp(a)]) being a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Olpasiran is a small interfering RNA molecule that markedly reduces Lp(a) production in hepatocytes.

Study Design

The Olpasiran trials of Cardiovascular Events And lipoproteiN(a) reduction-DOSE finding study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding study in 281 subjects with established ASCVD and Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L. Patients were randomly allocated to one of 4 active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran (10 mg q12 weeks, 75 mg q12 weeks, 225 mg q 12 weeks, or 225 mg q24 weeks) or matched placebo. The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of olpasiran dosed every 12 weeks compared with placebo on the percent change in Lp(a) from baseline at 36 weeks. Enrollment is now complete and follow-up is ongoing.

Conclusions

OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial is assessing the Lp(a)-lowering efficacy and safety of olpasiran. These data will be used to determine optimal dosing and design for a cardiovascular outcomes trial.

### The off-treatment effects of olpasiran on lipoprotein (a) lowering: OCEAN (a)-DOSE extension period results [^3aba8a05]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA), blocks lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) production by preventing translation of apolipoprotein(a) mRNA. In phase 2, higher doses of olpasiran every 12 weeks (Q12W) reduced circulating Lp(a) by > 95%.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the timing of return of Lp(a) to baseline after discontinuation of olpasiran, as well as longer-term safety.

Methods

OCEAN(a)-DOSE (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events And LipoproteiN[a] Reduction-DOSE Finding Study) was a phase 2, dose-finding trial that enrolled 281 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L to 1 of 4 active doses of olpasiran vs placebo (10 mg, 75 mg, 225 mg Q12W, or an exploratory dose of 225 mg Q24W given subcutaneously). The last dose of olpasiran was administered at week 36; after week 48, there was an extended off-treatment follow-up period for a minimum of 24 weeks.

Results

A total of 276 (98.2%) participants entered the off-treatment follow-up period. The median study exposure (treatment combined with off-treatment phases) was 86 weeks (Q1-Q3: 79–99 weeks). For the 75 mg Q12W dose, the off-treatment placebo-adjusted mean percent change from baseline in Lp(a) was -76.2%, -53.0%, -44.0%, and -27.9% at 60, 72, 84, and 96 weeks, respectively (all P < 0.001). The respective off-treatment changes in Lp(a) for the 225 mg Q12W dose were -84.4%, -61.6%, -52.2%, and -36.4% (all P < 0.001). During the extension follow-up phase, no new safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions

Olpasiran is a potent siRNA with prolonged effects on Lp(a) lowering. Participants receiving doses ≥ 75 mg Q12W sustained a ∼40% to 50% reduction in Lp(a) levels close to 1 year after the last dose.

### Olpasiran, oxidized phospholipids, and systemic inflammatory biomarkers: results from the OCEAN (a)-DOSE trial [^9f982050]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is thought to be the major carrier of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL). OxPL are believed to be a potent driver of inflammation and atherosclerosis. Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA, blocks Lp(a) production by inducing degradation of apolipoprotein(a) messenger RNA. Olpasiran's effects on OxPL and systemic markers of inflammation are not well described.

Objective

To assess the effects of olpasiran on OxPL, high-sensitivity interleukin 6 (hs-IL-6), and hs-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the OCEAN(a)-DOSE randomized clinical trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

OCEAN(a)-DOSE was an international, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-finding randomized clinical trial conducted between July 2020 and November 2022. A total of 281 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) levels greater than 150 nmol/L were included.

Intervention

Participants were randomized to receive 1 of 4 active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran vs placebo: (1) 10 mg, administered every 12 weeks (Q12W); (2) 75 mg, Q12W; (3) 225 mg, Q12W; or (4) 225 mg, administered every 24 weeks (Q24W). OxPL on apolipoprotein B (OxPL-apoB), hs-CRP, and hs-IL-6 were assessed at baseline, week 36, and week 48 in 272 patients.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was placebo-adjusted change in OxPL-apoB from baseline to week 36.

Results

Among 272 participants, median (IQR) age was 62 years (56–69), and 86 participants (31.6%) were female. Baseline median (IQR) Lp(a) concentration was 260.3 nmol/L (198.1–352.4) and median (IQR) OxPL-apoB concentration was 26.5 nmol/L (19.7–33.9). The placebo-adjusted mean percentage change in OxPL-apoB from baseline to week 36 was -51.6% (95% CI, -64.9% to -38.2%) for the 10-mg Q12W dose, -89.7% (95% CI, -103.0% to -76.4%) for the 75-mg Q12W dose, -92.3% (95% CI, -105.6% to -78.9%) for the 225-mg Q12W dose, and -93.7% (95% CI, -107.1% to -80.3%) for the Q24W dose (P < .001 for all). These effects were maintained to week 48 (-50.8%, -100.2%, -104.7%, and -85.8%, respectively; P < .001 for all). There was a strong correlation between percentage reduction in Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB for patients treated with olpasiran (r = 0.79; P < .001). Olpasiran did not significantly impact hs-CRP or hs-IL-6 compared with placebo to weeks 36 or 48 (P > .05).

Conclusion and Relevance

In the OCEAN(a)-DOSE multicenter randomized clinical trial, olpasiran led to a significant and sustained reduction in OxPL-apoB but no significant effects on hs-CRP or hs-IL-6.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^2ecf8e4d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Emerging Lp(a)-lowering agents — Pelacarsen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the mRNA transcribed from the LPA gene and can reduce Lp(a) levels by > 80%, while olpasiran is an siRNA with up to ∼100% reduction in circulating Lp(a) levels; whether these therapies can reduce MACE has not yet been established and is being tested in large ongoing outcome trials (Lp(a)HORIZON and OCEAN(a)), and other approaches including zerlasiran and lepodisiran (phase 2) and the oral agent muvalaplin are in early-phase testing.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein (a): a review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^afa77238]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelacarsen is an ASO that targets the apo(a) messenger RNA and leads to its destruction via ribonuclease H. Phase 2 clinical trial evidence demonstrates a dose‐dependent and up to 80% reduction in Lp(a) with pelacarsen among individuals with Lp(a) > 60 mg/dL and a history of ASCVD, where more than 4 in 5 were taking a statin, one‐half were on ezetimibe, and 1 in 5 were on PCSK9 monoclonal antibody therapy. Pelacarsen is administered via subcutaneous injection and is currently being studied as a monthly 80 mg dose in the Lp(a) HORIZON trial.

Olpasiran is an siRNA therapy that also targets apo(a) messenger RNA and leads to its destruction via RNA‐induced silencing complex. In the OCEAN(a)‐Dose Phase 2 clinical trial, olpasiran led to a mean 70% to 100% reduction in Lp(a) among persons with Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L and a history of ASCVD. Olpasiran is also dosed subcutaneously and is currently being studied as an injection every 3 months in the OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes trial. Similar to olpasiran, lepodisiran is a siRNA therapy that led to a maximal median reduction in Lp(a) level of > 90% over 1 year with a single dose. The ACCLAIM trial is currently enrolling participants with Lp(a) > 175 nmol/L with existing ASCVD, FH or a combination of risk factors. An additional siRNA that targets apo(a) and is currently being investigated is zerlasiran. Beyond subcutaneous therapy, muvalaplin is an oral Lp(a)‐lowering agent that prevents the assembly of Lp(a) in the liver and is associated with a maximum 86% reduction in Lp(a) in Phase 2 clinical trial data.

Beyond Lp(a)‐lowering, siRNA therapies targeting Lp(a) have been shown to lower levels of oxidised phospholipids on ApoB. While targeted Lp(a)‐lowering therapies have minimal effect on inflammatory biomarkers, evidence from phase 2 trials demonstrates a dose‐dependent reduction with interleukin‐6 inhibition and Lp(a) lowering. These results further support the role that inflammation may modulate levels of Lp(a), as there is an interleukin‐6 response element within the promoter region of the LPA gene.

4.5 Targeted Lp(a)‐lowering therapeutics

The only Food and Drug Administration approved therapy for Lp(a) lowering is apheresis for individuals with clinical ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with Lp(a) ≥ 60 mg/dL and LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid‐lowering therapy. While there is currently no approved Lp(a)‐lowering pharmacotherapy, there are three notable ongoing Phase 3 ASCVD outcome trials involving Lp(a)‐lowering therapy (Table 3). The Lp(a) HORIZON and OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes trials exclusively enrolled individuals with prevalent ASCVD, whereas the ACCLAIM trial includes those with and without clinical ASCVD. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), pelacarsen, is being evaluated in the Lp(a)HORIZON trial, and siRNA agents are being assessed in the OCEAN(a) (olpasiran) and ACCLAIM Trials (lepodisiran).

5 CONCLUSIONS

Lp(a) has emerged as a critical yet underrecognised cardiovascular risk factor, with robust evidence demonstrating a causal link between elevated levels and cardiovascular disease. Unlike traditional lipid markers, Lp(a) levels are predominantly genetically determined, relatively stable throughout life and minimally influenced by lifestyle factors. These unique characteristics make Lp(a) an important risk factor for lifelong cardiovascular risk stratification. Importantly, elevated Lp(a) identifies a subset of high‐risk individuals who may remain undetected using conventional risk assessment tools. Effective management in such cases includes optimising traditional risk factors, evaluating for subclinical atherosclerosis, considering statin therapy and, in some instances, exploring the use of PCSK9 inhibitors and aspirin. Given these insights, there is a strong case for routine Lp(a) testing, particularly among high‐risk groups such as individuals with premature ASCVD, a family history of cardiovascular disease, recurrent cardiovascular events despite optimal therapy and populations with inherently higher Lp(a) levels, including those of African and South Asian ancestry. Routine testing would enable earlier identification of at‐risk individuals and inform personalised preventive strategies.

Looking ahead, further research is essential to close existing knowledge gaps. Large‐scale trials such as Lp(a) HORIZON (pelacarsen), OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes (olpasiran) and ACCLAIM (lepodisiran) are poised to provide critical data on whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events. As these and other studies progress, they will play a pivotal role in shaping future guidelines, advancing Lp(a)‐targeted therapies, and ultimately, transforming cardiovascular risk management.

### An open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of olpasiran in Chinese participants with elevated serum lipoprotein (a) [^c7e97f70]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of premature mortality and disability worldwide, with China ranking among the highest in CVD deaths. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a circulating lipoprotein particle that, when elevated, may increase CVD risk. Reduced Lp(a) levels with existing cardiovascular treatments are modest, and evidence confirming whether lowering Lp(a) leads to cardiovascular benefit is lacking. Olpasiran (AMG 890), a liver cell-targeting small interfering RNA, has been shown to elicit profound Lp(a) reductions with an acceptable safety profile and is being evaluated in clinical trials worldwide. Therefore, investigating olpasiran's treatment potential for cardiovascular risk reduction in the Chinese population is important.

Participants and Methods

This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study in Chinese participants with elevated serum Lp(a). Participants with serum Lp(a) concentrations ≥ 70 nmol/L (or approximately ≥ 27 mg/dL) were randomized 1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous dose of olpasiran (75 or 225 mg). Olpasiran pharmacokinetic (PK) results were the primary endpoints; treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, lipids, and serum Lp(a) concentrations were the secondary endpoints.

Results

Twenty-four participants (12 per dose group) were randomized, and 23 participants completed the study. After reaching maximal serum concentrations (75 mg: 167 ng/mL; 225 mg: 667 ng/mL) in ∼3 hours, olpasiran concentrations in both groups declined rapidly and were predominantly cleared from circulation within 3 days. Sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentrations from baseline were observed for both doses, with maximal reductions seen on day 57 (75 mg: -94.8%; 225 mg: -99.2%). All TEAEs associated with olpasiran were mild/moderate in severity, with four participants in the 225 mg dose group experiencing five mild TEAEs at the injection site. No notable treatment- or dose-related trends in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations, or lipid panel results were identified, and no TEAEs leading to discontinuation or deaths were reported.

Discussion

Results from this study, as well as previous studies, indicate that olpasiran effectively and safely reduces Lp(a) levels in a similar manner across different ethnic populations.

Conclusions

Olpasiran administration (75 and 225 mg) was safe and well-tolerated in Chinese participants, and olpasiran PK and Lp(a) responses are generally consistent with those observed in East Asian/non-East Asian participants. Dose adjustments of olpasiran based on ethnicity are therefore not warranted, and work investigating the effects of olpasiran treatment on long-term cardiovascular risk in East Asian populations should continue.

### Small interfering RNA to reduce lipoprotein (a) in cardiovascular disease [^f3da06d3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) is a presumed risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Olpasiran is a small interfering RNA that reduces lipoprotein(a) synthesis in the liver.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial involving patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a lipoprotein(a) concentration of more than 150 nmol per liter. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of olpasiran (10 mg every 12 weeks, 75 mg every 12 weeks, 225 mg every 12 weeks, or 225 mg every 24 weeks) or matching placebo, administered subcutaneously. The primary end point was the percent change in the lipoprotein(a) concentration from baseline to week 36 (reported as the placebo-adjusted mean percent change). Safety was also assessed.

Results

Among the 281 enrolled patients, the median concentration of lipoprotein(a) at baseline was 260.3 nmol per liter, and the median concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 67.5 mg per deciliter. At baseline, 88% of the patients were taking statin therapy, 52% were taking ezetimibe, and 23% were taking a proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. At 36 weeks, the lipoprotein(a) concentration had increased by a mean of 3.6% in the placebo group, whereas olpasiran therapy had significantly and substantially reduced the lipoprotein(a) concentration in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in placebo-adjusted mean percent changes of -70.5% with the 10-mg dose, -97.4% with the 75-mg dose, -101.1% with the 225-mg dose administered every 12 weeks, and -100.5% with the 225-mg dose administered every 24 weeks (P < 0.001 for all comparisons with baseline). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar across the trial groups. The most common olpasiran-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, primarily pain.

Conclusions

Olpasiran therapy significantly reduced lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Longer and larger trials will be necessary to determine the effect of olpasiran therapy on cardiovascular disease. (Funded by Amgen; OCEAN[a]-DOSE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04270760.).

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^7a8f61af]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Addressing the Continuum ofRisk

To fully realize the potential of available and future LDL‐C–lowering therapies, we propose an approach of earlier identification and more aggressive treatment of individuals at the highest risk of ASCVD events. LDL‐C management should consider each patient's risk across the continuum of ASCVD, including subclinical atherosclerosis, the degree of desired LDL‐C lowering, the role of pharmacotherapy, and LDL‐C targets or thresholds (Figure 4). Although statins form the backbone of therapy, achieving a > 50% reduction in LDL‐C levels with high‐intensity statins is often insufficient for patients at the highest risk of ASCVD events; thus, it is key to identify high‐risk patients for whom a statin is only the beginning of a multidrug regimen to lower their ASCVD risk aggressively. For patients at very high risk who require LDL‐C lowering of ≥ 50%, there should be a consideration for early, upfront combination lipid‐lowering therapy and therapy titration every 4 to 12 weeks until LDL‐C goals are achieved. Use of fixed‐dose formulations may circumvent some of the barriers associated with LDL‐C lowering, such as medication adherence and polypharmacy.

Management of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels across the continuum of ASCVD risk to prevent first and subsequent cardiovascular events. PCSK9 indicates proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.

Non–LDL‐C targets, such as lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, pose a residual risk of ASCVD and should also be addressed. Emerging therapies targeting lipoprotein(a) include small interfering RNAs, olpasiran and SLN360, and an antisense oligonucleotide, pelacarsen, which has also been reported to reduce lipoprotein(a) by up to 80% while modestly reducing LDL‐C in phase 2 studies, Evinacumab and the antisense oligonucleotide, olezarsen (IONIS‐APOCIII‐LRx), are being investigated for the reduction of triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins. However, a comprehensive discussion of these novel agents is beyond the scope of this review.

### Biomarkers for cardiovascular-kidney metabolic syndrome: clinical utility in diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^c9584b88]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The paradigm by which Lp(a) informs treatment is evolving. Unlike lipids, Lp(a) levels are not modified by lifestyle interventions. Statins modestly increase Lp(a) but remain important for reduction in overall ASCVD risk. PCKS9 inhibitors have been shown to lower Lp(a) by 25–30% with greater reduction in ASCVD observed in those with the highest Lp(a) levels. Given the pro‐thrombotic properties of Lp(a), aspirin may be considered in those with elevated Lp(a) although this has not been confirmed prospectively.

More recently, specific potent Lp(a) lowering therapies have been developed which include subcutaneous antisense oligonucleotides (pelcarsen) and silencing interfering RNA based agents (olpasiran, lepodisiran, zerlasiran) which inhibit hepatic production. Oral small molecules such as muvalaplin are also under evaluation. Lp(a) specific therapies are now being studied in several cardiovascular outcome trials (HORIZON, OCEAN and ACCLAIM) and the results of these studies will be pivotal in informing our understanding of whether Lp(a) lowering constitutes a modifiable cardiac risk factor. Furthermore, should these trials demonstrate the clinical benefit of Lp(a) directed therapies, the role of monitoring serial Lp(a) levels will warrant further exploration.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^06ba9453]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Emerging therapies

Novel antisense and small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatments that target apo(a) production in the hepatocyte lower Lp(a) concentration. In early trials, mean decreases of 80 and 72% were reported with the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen [formerly TQJ230 and AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx] given 20 mg weekly and 60 mg every 4 weeks, respectively, with 98% and 81% of participants attaining Lp(a) levels < 125 nmol/L at the end of the study. Reductions ranging between 71% and 97% were observed with olpasiran (formerly AMG 890), a N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated siRNA, which were sustained for over 6 months. Both treatments showed a favourable safety profile. Another GalNAc-conjugated siRNA (SLN360, Silence Therapeutics) is in early development.

How much should Lp(a) be lowered for benefit?

Although estimates vary, several Mendelian randomization studies suggested that large absolute reductions in Lp(a) concentration (> 50–100 mg/dL) are needed for a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of ASCVD events in a 'short-term' (< 5 years) clinical trial. How much Lp(a) needs to be lowered to produce a clinically meaningful benefit remains uncertain. Data are awaited from the Lp(a)HORIZON trial in patients with ASCVD and elevated Lp(a) (> 70 mg/dL) (NCT04023552).

### Early health technology assessment of gene silencing therapies for lowering lipoprotein (a) in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease [^430480c1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Olpasiran and pelacarsen are gene-silencing therapies that lower lipoprotein(a). Cardiovascular outcome trials are ongoing. Mendelian randomization studies estimated clinical benefits from lipoprotein(a) lowering.

Objective

Our study estimated prices at which olpasiran and pelacarsen, in addition to standard-of-care, would be deemed cost-effective in reducing risk of recurrent coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the Australian healthcare system.

Methods

We developed a decision tree and lifetime Markov model. For olpasiran, participants had CHD and lipoprotein(a) 260 nmol/L at baseline and three-monthly injections, profiled on OCEAN(a) Outcomes trial (NCT05581303). Baseline risks of CHD, costs and utilities were obtained from published sources. Clinical trial data were used to derive reductions in lipoprotein(a) from treatment. Mendelian randomization study data were used to estimate downstream clinical benefits. Annual discounting was 5%. For pelacarsen, participants had CHD and lipoprotein(a) 226 nmol/L at baseline and one-monthly injections, profiled on Lp(a) HORIZON (NCT04023552) trial.

Results

Olpasiran in addition to standard-of-care saved 0.87 discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per person. Olpasiran in addition to standard-of-care would be cost-effective at annual prices of AU$1867 (AU$467 per dose) at threshold AU$28,000 per QALY. Pelacarsen would be cost-effective at annual prices of AU$984 (AU$82 per dose). For incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold AU$50,000 per QALY, olpasiran and pelacarsen would be cost-effective at annual prices AU$4207 and AU$2464, respectively.

Conclusion

This early health technology assessment model used inclusion criteria from clinical trials. Olpasiran and pelacarsen would be cost-effective if annual treatment prices were AU$1867 and AU$984, respectively, from the Australian healthcare perspective.

### Discovery of potent small-molecule inhibitors of lipoprotein (a) formation [^dd155453]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

At present, there are no therapeutics available in clinical practice that specifically reduce the levels of Lp(a) by itself. Pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that targets LPA, and olpasiran, an LPA small interfering RNA, are both injectable therapeutics that are currently in phase 3 clinical studies. These interventions have shown a robust Lp(a)-lowering effect, with good tolerability. Results from ongoing phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials, such as HORIZON and OCEAN(a), will provide much-needed evidence about the therapeutic utility of Lp(a)-lowering treatments. So far, no small molecule that specifically targets apo(a) has been studied in humans; however, the plasminogen inhibitor tranexamic acid was found to reduce the levels of Lp(a) in a small clinical study. The goal of our research was to develop a potent and selective orally delivered small-molecule therapeutic to inhibit the formation of Lp(a) by blocking the first interaction between apo(a) and apoB to reduce the circulating levels of Lp(a). A potent and selective small-molecule Lp(a)-reducing therapeutic could provide a way to decrease the number of primary and/or secondary major adverse cardiovascular events in patients who are at risk of cardiovascular disease because of their high levels of Lp(a).

### Gene therapy and genome editing for lipoprotein disorders [^93c9689e]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

ApoC-III has recently gained attention as a promising pharmacological target for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. Evidence from Mendelian randomisation studies reveal that individuals with APOC3 null alleles tend to have lower triglycerides levels and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease over their lifetime. A recent phase 3 randomized controlled study in FCS patients demonstrated a 43.5% reduction in triglycerides with the highest dose of olezarsen, an ASO RNA inhibitor of APOC3. Acute pancreatitis risk was reduced significantly (mean rate ratio of olezarsen groups vs. placebo was 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.66). Moreover, in another phase 3 trial among patients with moderate hypertriglyceridaemia and increased cardiovascular risk, olezarsen significantly reduced levels of triglycerides, apoB, and non-HDL cholesterol. A recently completed phase 3 trial in patients with clinically or genetically confirmed FCS with plozasiran, an siRNA inhibitor of APOC3, demonstrated up to an 80% median reduction in triglycerides levels at month 10, as well as a statistically significant 83% reduction in the incidence of acute pancreatitis compared with placebo. The triglyceride lowering and prevention of acute pancreatitis were similar in patients with genotypically-confirmed FCS and severe hypertriglyceridaemia without biallelic loss of function mutations in LPL.

Currently, multiple cardiovascular outcomes trials are evaluating whether Lp(a)-lowering RNA-targeted therapies reduce the risk of ASCVD events. Pelacarsen, a second-generation ASO, has shown promising results in reducing Lp(a) levels in phase 1/2a and 2b trials, with reductions up to 92%.siRNA therapies including olpasiran, zerlasiran, and lepodisiran have demonstrated significant Lp(a) reductions, with olpasiran achieving up to 101.1% placebo-adjusted reduction in the phase 2 OCEAN(a) DOSE trial, lepodisiran up to 97% reduction with the maximal dose in the phase 1 study, and zerlasiran showing a 96.4% reduction in the recently published phase 2 trial. A small-molecule strategy targeting Lp(a) with muvalaplin is currently under investigation (see Supplementary Data online, Table S1). Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trials with Lp(a) inhibitors are currently ongoing.

### Clinical trial design for lipoprotein (a)-lowering therapies: JACC focus seminar 2 / 3 [^8d645340]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a source of residual risk in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Clinical trials of fully human monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 have shown that reductions in Lp(a) concentrations may be a predictor of event reduction with this class of cholesterol-lowering therapy. With the advent of selective therapies targeting Lp(a) such as antisense oligonucleotides, small-interfering RNA-based therapies, and gene editing, lowering of Lp(a) may lead to reduction in ASCVD. The phase 3 Lp(a)HORIZON (Assessing the Impact of Lipoprotein(a) Lowering with TQJ230 on Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients With CVD) outcomes trial is currently testing the effect of pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide, on ASCVD risk. Olpasiran is a small-interfering RNA that is in a phase 3 clinical trial. As these therapies enter clinical trials, challenges in trial design will have to be addressed to optimize patient selection and outcomes.

### Lipoprotein (a) and the risk for recurrent Ischemic stroke events [^134eedec]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Determination of whether lowering Lp(a) reduces stroke risk awaits completion of the HORIZON (Randomized Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Trial Assessing the Impact of Lipoprotein (a) Lowering With Pelacarsen [TQJ230] on Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease;). This trial enrolled very high-risk patients with either ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. In contrast, the OCEAN(a) Outcomes Trial (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events and Lipoprotein(a) Reduction;), another trial of an Lp(a)-lowering therapy, is enrolling patients with coronary heart disease.

Until completion of clinical trials with Lp(a)-lowering therapies, we support screening for Lp(a) molar concentrations in adults with a stroke after resolution of the acute phase response as recommended by the American Heart Association. Interventions to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke events in these patients should include lifestyle modifications, control of cardiovascular risk factors, and lowering LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with a high-intensity statin. For stroke patients with an LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL despite taking maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an Lp(a) level > 125 nmol/L, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies could be considered based on subgroup analyses of FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes that reported this therapy reduces the risk for major cardiovascular events and this risk reduction was larger in patients with high vs low levels of Lp(a) (Figure 1). In patients with LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL, Lp(a) > 125 nmol/L, and LDL-C < 25% above the target, ezetimibe is an option.

Figure 1
Translating SPARCL-Lp(a) into Clinical Practice

Among SPARCL patients taking atorvastatin 80 mg daily, high vs low Lp(a) levels was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease events but not stroke events. Until completion of randomized clinical trials with selective Lp(a) lowering therapies, we advocate a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor to lower LDL-C < 55 mg/dL in patients with high Lp(a) levels, particularly when the LDL-C level is > 25% above targeted levels. LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Aspirin and cardiovascular risk in individuals with elevated lipoprotein (a): the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^f467226b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Importantly, there is currently no approved medical therapy for treating lipoprotein(a)‐mediated risk, but there is evidence that targeting lipoprotein(a) may result in a reduction in CVD risk. Statins increase lipoprotein(a) 10% to 25%, and CVD risk remains in statin‐treated patients with elevated lipoprotein(a). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors achieve modest lowering of lipoprotein(a), and secondary analyses of clinical trials suggest that this results in a reduction in events, but this has not been assessed in primary prevention, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are not approved for the indication of elevated lipoprotein(a). Antisense oligonucleotides and short interfering RNA produce potent lipoprotein(a) lowering and are in clinical development, including 2 ongoing phase 3 secondary prevention clinical trials, Lp(a) HORIZON (NCT04023552) and OCEAN(a) is Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events and Lipoprotein(a) Reduction ‐ Outcomes Trial (NCT05581303). However, there are no ongoing trials for the use of these drugs in primary prevention. Our study suggests a benefit to aspirin therapy for primary prevention of CHD in people with elevated lipoprotein(a).

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein (a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^f254834c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, investigational agents have shown promising lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects in clinical studies and several studies are ongoing (Table 4). Pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide currently in phase 3 development, showed lipoprotein(a) reductions of up to 80% in a phase 2 study of patients with established CVD and lipoprotein(a) levels ≥ 150 nmol/L. Adverse events in patients treated with pelacarsen were mostly mild or moderate, with injection‐site reactions the most commonly observed. Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA also in phase 3 development, demonstrated up to 101% placebo‐adjusted lipoprotein(a) reduction in patients with established ASCVD and lipoprotein(a) levels > 150 nmol/L. Similarly, zerlasiran, a small interfering RNA, showed up to 98% lipoprotein(a) reduction in a phase 1 study of adults with lipoprotein(a) levels ≥ 150 nmol/L and without known CVD. Both olpasiran and zerlasiran were generally well tolerated in clinical studies with mostly mild adverse events. Importantly, the potential for off‐target effects with small interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides is generally considered to be low. The next steps for these agents will be to understand whether their lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects will translate into a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events. Phase 3 trials are ongoing for pelacarsen and olpasiran, with outcome data expected in 2025 and 2026, respectively. An additional small interfering RNA, lepodisiran, is currently under investigation in a phase 2 study, as is muvalaplin, an oral small molecule inhibitor of lipoprotein(a); however, no results have been published to date for either of these agents.

### Preclinical development and phase 1 trial of a novel siRNA targeting lipoprotein (a) [^d4ac90a9]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Compelling evidence supports a causal role for lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in cardiovascular disease. No pharmacotherapies directly targeting Lp(a) are currently available for clinical use. Here we report the discovery and development of olpasiran, a first-in-class, synthetic, double-stranded, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to directly inhibit LPA messenger RNA translation in hepatocytes and potently reduce plasma Lp(a) concentration. Olpasiran reduced Lp(a) concentrations in transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys in a dose-responsive manner, achieving up to over 80% reduction from baseline for 5–8 weeks after administration of a single dose. In a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of olpasiran (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03626662), the primary outcome was safety and tolerability, and the secondary outcomes were the change in Lp(a) concentrations and olpasiran pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants tolerated single doses of olpasiran well and experienced a 71–97% reduction in Lp(a) concentration with effects persisting for several months after administration of doses of 9mg or higher. Serum concentrations of olpasiran increased approximately dose proportionally. Collectively, these results validate the approach of using hepatocyte-targeted siRNA to potently lower Lp(a) in individuals with elevated plasma Lp(a) concentration.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^a572f127]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Lp(a) as a target

Elevated Lp(a) levels are an ASCVD risk factor across numerous patient demographics and geographic ancestries, as well as in patients treated with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. The Lp(a) particle resembles LDL, but is independently regulated and metabolized. Both niacin and serial apheresis treatments were previously recommended to reduce Lp(a) but each has significant drawbacks and neither reduced ASCVD events. PCSK9 inhibitors — both monoclonal antibodies and inclisiran — lower Lp(a) by 26%, but this is insufficient for individuals with very high Lp(a) levels. A GalNAc-linked ASO against Lp(a) (TQJ230, trade name pelacarsen, Novartis) reduces its levels by 80% to 90% with no effect on other variables; this agent is being evaluated in a large randomized of secondary prevention of ASCVD in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels. An siRNA compound aimed at reducing apo(a) synthesis (AMG 890, trade name olpasiran, Amgen) is also under investigation. Depending on results of outcome trials, these agents could be helpful for patients with elevated Lp(a) levels.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^ae1e158a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Statins — across guidelines, statins remain first-line therapy for mitigating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–driven atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; although statins do not lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it, they reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by "approximately 22% for each 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C". Median Lp(a) was not affected by rosuvastatin in JUPITER, and on-treatment Lp(a) increases with statins are minimal on average ("approximate 1.1-mg/dL increase or 0.1% relative increase"). Concerns about Lp(a) elevation "should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue statins".

### Lipoprotein (a) levels in a global population with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^4f7cc4cb]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has long been recognised as an important genetically determined risk factor for development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Recent European and American guidelines have identified Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor for development of ASCVD. However, Lp(a) is not commonly measured in clinical practice, in part because no currently available treatments exist with established benefits on vascular outcomes. Recent developments in messenger RNA targeted gene silencing therapies have made it possible to lower time-averaged Lp(a) levels as much as 90% in patients with elevated levels. A large phase III clinical trial, Lp(a)HORIZON is now underway, studying the investigational drug pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide, to determine if lowering Lp(a) can reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with pre-existing ASCVD. As a prelude to the initiation of this trial, the current Lp(a)HERITAGE study sought to determine Lp(a) levels in a large global population with ASCVD and identify patients suitable for enrolment in Lp(a)HORIZON.

With the development of therapies effective at lowering Lp(a), it is important to understand the prevalence and patterns of elevated Lp(a) levels in a diverse population with pre-existing ASCVD. Most prior studies have examined either a general population that included both primary and secondary prevention patients, moderate-sized cohortsor performed measurements in single countries or regions. Currently available studies measured Lp(a) levels primarily in high-income countries, resulting in limited availability of data in a global population that includes both high-income and low-income and middle-income countries within Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa. To make the current study relevant to emerging treatments, the Lp(a)HERITAGE study included only patients with documented ASCVD. An important goal of this study was to better understand the global prevalence of elevated Lp(a) and identify racial, ethnic, regional and gender differences in Lp(a) levels. Additional goals included understanding how results differ across alternative measurement systems based on Lp(a) mass versus concentration and the relationship between levels of Lp(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

### Association of lipoprotein (a) with major Adverse cardiovascular events Across hs-CRP: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ab44013]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

The identification of Lp(a) as a significant risk factor for MACE, independent of hs-CRP has important clinical implications for potential Lp(a) therapeutics, as these results suggest that they may be effective in all patients with elevated Lp(a), not only those with high Lp(a) and high hs-CRP. Elevated Lp(a) level (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L) and high hs-CRP (≥ 2 mg/L) are both recognized as risk-enhancing factors by the ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines. As Lp(a) becomes integrated into clinical practice for cardiovascular risk assessment, our findings support its independent association within primary prevention regardless of hs-CRP status.

Multiple emerging therapies can significantly reduce Lp(a) synthesis in the liver by employing distinct pathways including antisense oligonucleotide (pelacarsen), small interfering RNA (olpasiran, lepodisiran, zerlasiran), and stereotactic inhibition of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein(a) interaction (muvalaplin). Among these therapies, pelacarsen and olpasiran are currently being studied in phase III randomized clinical trials and might offer a novel preventive and risk mitigation strategy in high-risk secondary prevention populations. Given the consistent association of elevated Lp(a) with MACE risk across hs-CRP levels, our study indicates that patients may benefit from these therapies regardless of their "residual inflammatory" risk.

### The promise of PCSK9 and lipoprotein (a) as targets for gene silencing therapies [^09333950]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

High plasma concentrations of LDL and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) are independent and causal risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). There is an unmet therapeutic need for high-risk patients with elevated levels of LDL-C and/or Lp(a). Recent advances in the development of nucleic acids for gene silencing (ie, triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated antisense-oligonucleotides [ASOs] and small interfering RNA [siRNA]) targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and Lp(a) offer effective and sustainable therapies.

Methods

Related articles in the English language were identified through a search for original and review articles in the PubMed database using the following key terms: cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, PCSK9 inhibitors, Lp(a), LDL-cholesterol, familial hypercholesterolemia, siRNA, and antisense oligonucleotide and clinical trials (either alone or in combination).

Findings

Inclisiran, the most advanced siRNA-treatment targeting hepatic PCSK9, is well tolerated, producing a > 30% reduction on LDL-C levels in randomized controlled trials. Pelacarsen is the most clinical advanced ASO, whereas olpasiran and SLN360 are the 2 siRNAs directed against the mRNA of the LPA gene. Evidence suggests that all Lp(a)-targeting agents are safe and well tolerated, with robust and sustained reduction in plasma Lp(a) concentration up to 70% to 90% in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels.

Implications

Cumulative evidence from clinical trials supports the value of ASO and siRNA therapies targeting the synthesis of PCSK9 and Lp(a) for lowering LDL-C and Lp(a) in patients with established ASCVD or high risk of ASCVD. Further research is needed to examine whether gene silencing therapy could improve clinical outcomes in patients with elevated LDL and/or Lp(a) levels. Confirmation of the tolerability and cost-effectiveness of long-term inhibition of PCSK9 and Lp(a) with this approach is essential.

### Fixed-dose combination therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [^fb70a657]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed-dose combination of blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD.

Objectives

To determine the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health-related quality of life, and costs.

Search Methods

We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed-dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure-lowering and one lipid-lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre-existing ASCVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect models when heterogeneity was low (I 2 < 50%) and random-effects models when heterogeneity was high (I 2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence.

Main Results

In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow-up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow-up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed-dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89, I² = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non-fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I² = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low-quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed-dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed-dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate-quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event. The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was -6.34 mmHg (95% CI -9.03 to -3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate-quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were -0.61 mmol/L (95% CI -0.88 to -0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low-quality evidence) and -0.70 mmol/L (95% CI -0.98 to -0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate-quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I 2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed-dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed-dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer-term trials of fixed-dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short-term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.

### Harnessing RNA interference for cholesterol lowering: the bench-to-bedside story of Inclisiran [^bccfa54d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Inhibitingfor Lipid Lowering

The interaction surface between PCSK9 and the epidermal growth‐factor‐like domain A in the LDLR is challenging to target pharmaceutically. The PCSK9 proteolytic site is not required for its interaction with the LDLR, suggesting that any small molecule inhibitors designed to antagonize PCSK9 catalytic activity would need to enter the endoplasmic reticulum to inhibit PCSK9 cleavage and would not affect the extracellular PCSK9–LDLR interaction.

Antibodies to reversibly neutralize extracellular PCSK9 were shown to successfully disrupt the PCSK9−LDLR interaction and to reduce LDLR degradation in proof‐of‐concept in vitro and animal studies. Following promising results in mice and nonhuman primates,2 anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, alirocumab and evolocumab, were evaluated in clinical trials. These demonstrated LDL‐C reductions of up to 60% to 70%, and in patients with a history of ASCVD, an ≈15% relative reduction in cardiovascular event risk versus standard of care when added to maximally tolerated statins, and were the first approved therapies targeting PCSK9 (Box 1).,

In addition to LDL‐C lowering, anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies reduce levels of lipoprotein (a) (LP(a)), an LDL‐like particle identified as an independent, causal, genetically determined ASCVD risk factor, by ≈25% in clinical trial populations not enriched for patients with elevated Lp(a). There are currently no approved therapies to treat elevated Lp(a), but RNA‐targeted therapies that reduce Lp(a) by inhibiting the synthesis of apolipoprotein(a) are in clinical development, including the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and the siRNA therapies olpasiran, zerlasiran (SLN360), and lepodisiran (LY3819469).

Despite high rates of adherence to prescribed anti‐PSCK9 monoclonal antibodies in clinical trials, evidence from registry studies has demonstrated poor clinical uptake of anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and high rates of discontinuation in real‐world clinical practice. One study reported that < 1% of patients with dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, or coronary heart disease were prescribed anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in the United States between 2015 and 2017. Potential historical reasons for poor uptake include burden of self‐administration, high cost, and complex prior authorization processes. Registry studies suggest that up to ≈80% of people with ASCVD are not at LDL‐C goals despite the availability of anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and other oral LLTs, suggesting there remains an unmet need for additional LLTs and strategies to improve patient access to existing LLTs.

### Lipoprotein (a) levels in a global population with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^a6894683]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There were several goals of the Lp(a)HERITAGE study, including characterisation of Lp(a) patterns in a large global secondary prevention population and increasing awareness of the importance of Lp(a) as a risk factor for ASCVD. The study also sought to identify patients potentially suitable for enrolment in the pivotal phase III Lp(a)HORIZON trial that is studying cardiovascular outcomes for the investigational drug pelacarsen in patients with elevated Lp(a) and pre-existing ASCVD. Identification of patients with elevated Lp(a) eligible for participation in clinical trials of emerging therapies is challenging because this biomarker is not commonly measured even in patients with premature ASCVD. To our knowledge, this is the first large study to report Lp(a) and LDL-C levels in patients with ASCVD in an ethnically and regionally diverse global population. Several pioneering Danish studies included 2527 patients with a history of ASCVD and a recent UK Biobank study included 22 401 patients with incident ASCVD, but both were single country studies and not regionally or ethnically diverse.

Risk factors of cardiovascular disease and heart failure

Inclisiran is a siRNA that inhibits the translation of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a serine protease that degrades the LDL receptor, which mediates LDL removal by the liver. Its efficacy in reducing LDL‐cholesterol levels has been demonstrated in the phase 3 ORION‐9 trial in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and in the subsequent ORION‐10 and ORION‐11 randomized controlled trials. A patient‐level analysis of the three ORION randomized controlled trials showed a lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with inclisiran compared to placebo.

Furthermore, LDL‐cholesterol levels could be reduced by blocking angiopoietin‐like 3, a circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme that clears triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein from the circulation, and endothelial lipase. Results from the phase 1 AROANG1001 study indicated that angiopoietin‐like 3 silencing with the N‐acetylgalactosamine‐conjugated siRNA ARO‐ANG3 was generally well tolerated and can effectively lower circulating concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins. Phase 2/3 trials are required to confirm the LDL reduction along cardiovascular outcome events.

Lipoprotein(a) is another lipoprotein whose levels strongly correlate with the risk of atherosclerotic CVD and cardiovascular events. The phase 1 OCEAN‐DOSE trial demonstrated that inhibition of hepatic lipoprotein(a) synthesis with the siRNA olpasiran abated lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD. Longer and larger trials are ongoing to determine the effect of olpasiran therapy on CVD outcomes [OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes Trial, NCT05581303].

Finally, knockdown of hepatic angiotensinogen, the precursor of all angiotensins, via the siRNA zilebesiran markedly decreases serum angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensin II, and blood pressure for a duration of at least 24 weeks. Zilebesiran is being further evaluated as a potential treatment for hypertension in two phase 2 studies: KARDIA‐1 and KARDIA‐2.

Referral to lipid specialist for LDL-related atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk — consider referring patients with ASCVD and/or baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dL, including those with intolerance to at least 2 (preferably 3) statin therapies with 1 attempt at the lowest FDA-approved dose and a trial of an alternative statin regimen such as every-other-day dosing; lipid specialists may also be available for virtual visits for patients in some rural or remote locations.

### Marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 127 477 participants [^aea26462]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In the current study, the linear dose–response relationship observed between marine omega‐3 supplementation and several CVD end points is both clinically and biologically plausible. Because most included trials comprise patients at high risk of CVD and with advanced atherosclerosis, a high dose of marine omega‐3 supplementation may be needed to achieve potential benefits in this setting. A dose–response analysis based on 58 placebo‐controlled trials estimated that each 1 g/d increase of marine omega‐3 reduced triglyceride levels by 5.9 mg/dL and such linear association did not plateau even at 7 g/d. 24 Nevertheless, our dose–response analysis was highly exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously. Because most included trials had a dose around 850 mg/d, the slope of the regression line was essentially determined by few distinctive doses within a narrow range, which may not be sufficient to delineate the underlying dose–response relationship. Although including REDUCE‐IT generated significant linear dose–response relationships between marine omega‐3 supplementation and most CVD outcomes, the substantially changed slopes suggested that the marine omega‐3 dose of 4000 mg/d was an influential outlier (most trials tested doses ≤ 1000 mg/d and the second largest dose was 1800 mg/d). Nevertheless, the general inverse trend in the dose–response analysis without including REDUCE‐IT suggested that the protective effects of marine omega‐3 may be evident even at moderate‐to‐high doses. Eventually, incorporating data from the ongoing trial STRENGTH (Statin Residual Risk Reduction With Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia), which is testing a high dose of marine omega‐3 supplementation, may help to further clarify the dose–response relationship between marine omega‐3 supplementation and CVD risk. Furthermore, results from our sensitivity analysis that excluded 4 smaller RCTs (Figure S4) suggested that adequate sample size, moderate‐to‐high marine omega‐3 dose, and longer treatment duration are required to ensure a rigorous and reliable assessment of the effect of marine omega‐3 supplementation on CVD end points. Finally, it is noteworthy that removing 2 open‐label trials attenuated the estimates for CHD death only (Table S1). This is largely because of the exclusion of GISSI‐P, the trial with the largest study weight (19.48%) among all included trials and showing a statistically significant risk reduction in this end point of nearly 20%. However, despite widening of CIs because of sample size reduction, the RR point estimates were virtually unchanged for MI, total CVD, and other vascular end points.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for integrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity treatment: a framework for pragmatic, patient-centered care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^f43305e4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) multimorbidity — treatment prioritization is guided by net benefit and guideline strength: guidelines offer some support inherently, prioritizing Class of Recommendation 1, Level of Evidence A therapies over other therapies, and net benefit should be a key guiding principle — therapies with the greatest expected absolute risk reduction and fewest harm tradeoffs — should inform how therapies are sequenced. With multimorbidity, an integrative assessment of net benefit across chronic conditions offers a more holistic approach to treatment prioritization, and lipid-lowering therapies generally offer robust ischemic risk reduction over time with a favorable safety profile. Agents such as sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) offer a range of important benefits, beyond glucose lowering, including reduction in CV mortality, HF hospitalization, and renal complications, and should be prioritized for use in patients with ASCVD, HF, diabetes, and/or CKD. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) not only lower glucose but have been shown to significantly lower weight and risk of CV death, ischemic complications, and amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may be particularly favorable in patients with obesity and/or ASCVD. Additional factors to consider include cost, tolerability, need for titration, and adherence (for example, once daily or less frequent dosing and route of administration).

### Lipoprotein (a) and its significance in cardiovascular disease: a review [^de768117]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-like particle bound to apolipoprotein(a). This novel marker of cardiovascular disease acts through induction of vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, calcification, and thrombosis. While an absolute risk threshold remains to be universally accepted, an estimated 20% to 25% of the global population have Lp(a) levels of 50 mg/dL or higher, a level noted by the European Atherosclerosis Society to confer increased cardiovascular risk.

Observations

Compelling evidence from pathophysiological, observational, and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between high Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Additional evidence has demonstrated that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with a residual cardiovascular risk despite traditional risk factor optimization, including LDL cholesterol reduction. These findings have led to the formulation of the Lp(a) hypothesis, namely that Lp(a) lowering leads to cardiovascular risk reduction, intensifying the search for Lp(a)-reducing therapies. The ineffectiveness of lifestyle modification, statins, and ezetimibe to lower Lp(a); the modest Lp(a) reduction with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors; the adverse effect profile and unclear cardiovascular benefit of pharmacotherapies such as niacin and mipomersen; and the impracticality of regular lipoprotein apheresis represent major challenges to currently available therapies. Nevertheless, emerging nucleic acid-based therapies, such as the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and the small interfering RNA olpasiran, are generating interest because of their potent Lp(a)-lowering effects. Assessment of new-onset diabetes in patients achieving very low Lp(a) levels will be important in future trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Epidemiologic and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between elevated Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aortic valve stenosis. Emerging nucleic acid-based therapies have potent Lp(a)-lowering effects and appear safe; phase 3 trials will establish whether they improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Lipoprotein (a) is markedly more atherogenic than LDL: an apolipoprotein B-based genetic analysis [^a10c9340]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of the present study have relevance for risk assessment in those with elevated Lp(a), setting thresholds for intervention to prevent disease outcomes, and for the design and interpretation of trials with newly developed Lp(a) lowering agents such as pelacarsen and olpasiran. While we await the results of trials of Lp(a) as a target for intervention, it is useful to consider recent reports of outcome studies in which for the first time Lp(a) was reduced substantially by the drug under investigation. In FOURIER and Odyssey Outcomes, Lp(a) at baseline was a predictor of ongoing CHD risk in subjects with low LDL-C levels, and both evolocumab and alirocumab lowered Lp(a) by an average of 23% to 29% in addition to reducing LDL-C by 50–60%. The higher atherogenicity of Lp(a) relative to LDL as reported in the present study helps explain why in both trials it was observed that the relative risk reduction on a PCSK9 inhibitor tended to be lower in subjects with the lowest baseline Lp(a) levels despite substantial LDL-C lowering, and conversely greater in subjects with the highest baseline Lp(a) who experienced the largest Lp(a) decrease. Further, in FOURIER the investigators estimated the relative risk reduction attributable to the lowering of Lp(a) as 15% per 25 nmol/L decrease. This value is of the same order as the predicted risk reduction from our analysis of the gradient between Lp(a)-apoB and CHD risk. It is noteworthy that the mean absolute decrease in Lp(a) mass concentration in ODYSSEY Outcomes was 5.0 mg/dl (approximately 12 nmol/L) while in FOURIER the median decrease was 11 nmol/L. Considering the earlier predicted responses to Lp(a) lowering, these small changes should have had little impact on relative risk reduction seen in the trials. However, the consistent observation in both outcome studies that a decrease in Lp(a) contributed significantly to the overall benefit suggests that the atherogenicity of the particle is greater, as indicated by our findings.

Approach to risk assessment — The Work Group recognized the need for an approach based on data that primary care providers could easily collect and implement and endorsed the paradigm of matching the intensity of preventive efforts with the individual's absolute risk; it acknowledges that none of the examined risk assessment tools or novel markers have been formally evaluated in randomized controlled trials with clinical events, states that treatment can be targeted to those most likely to benefit in the context of a "risk discussion" that could include the patient's ASCVD risk, potential benefits, adverse effects, risks, and patient preferences, and notes the limitation that risk estimation is based on group averages applied to individuals such that no one has 10% or 20% or 4% of a heart attack during a 10-year period.

### All we need to know about lipoprotein (a) [^93ba83b8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a genetically determined macromolecular complex, is independently and causally associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic stenosis via proposed proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and proatherogenic mechanisms. While Lp(a) measurement standardization issues are being resolved, several guidelines now support testing Lp(a) at least once in each adult's lifetime for ASCVD risk prediction which can foster implementation of more aggressive primary or secondary prevention therapies. Currently, there are several emerging targeted Lp(a) lowering therapies in active clinical investigation for safety and cardiovascular benefit among both primary and secondary prevention populations. First degree relatives of patients with high Lp(a) should be encouraged to undergo cascade screening. Primary prevention patients with high Lp(a) should consider obtaining a coronary calcium score for further risk estimation and to guide further ASCVD risk factor management including consideration of low dose aspirin therapy. Secondary prevention patients with high Lp(a) levels should consider adding PCSK9 inhibition to statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^84939dff]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a)-directed treatment actions — In adults aged 40–75 y with a 10-y ASCVD risk of 7.5%–19.9%, the finding of an Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL is reasonable to be used as a risk-enhancing factor to favor initiation of a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, it is reasonable to consider more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to achieve greater ASCVD risk reduction. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients taking a maximally tolerated statin with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, the addition of ezetimibe is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), and the addition of a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL). Lipoprotein apheresis is reasonable for high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, and niacin or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, which lower Lp(a), is not recommended to reduce ASCVD risk.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^8021d83a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) testing and risk categorization — Adults (aged ≥ 18 y): measurement of Lp(a) in all adults is reasonable to refine risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; youth (aged < 18 y): selective screening of Lp(a) is recommended in high-risk patients such as clinically suspected or genetically confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), ischemic stroke of unknown cause, first-degree relatives with a history of premature ASCVD (age < 55 years in men, < 65 years in women), or first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a); when Lp(a) levels are used for ASCVD risk assessment, it is reasonable to use measurements ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) as levels suggesting high risk, levels < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) as low risk, and levels between as intermediate risk.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^01ea91f7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) recommendations and thresholds for assessment and therapy: Adults (aged ≥ 18 y) measurement of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in all adults is reasonable to refine atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment (COR I, LOE B-NR). For ASCVD risk stratification, it is reasonable to use Lp(a) thresholds of ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) for high risk, < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) for low risk, and values between as intermediate risk (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). The use of an adjustment factor to estimate Lp(a)-cholesterol (Lp(a)-C) for correction of calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is not recommended (COR III [no benefit], LOE C-EO), and because accepted conversion factors to adjust for Lp(a)-C in LDL-C calculation have proven inaccurate, such adjustments should not be used. Lipoprotein apheresis is an FDA-approved therapy for high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and ASCVD whose Lp(a) remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (~150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (COR IIa, LOE B-NR), and lipoprotein apheresis is the first therapy to receive a FDA indication for Lp(a) reduction.

Young adults and early risk assessment — Adults aged < 40 years with LDL-C values ≥ 160 mg/dL and/or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease may benefit from statin consideration; in patients with a family history of premature ASCVD, measurement of Lp(a) may help identify those who may benefit from early statin initiation; for patients aged ≥ 32 years, CAC scoring has been shown to help identify those with a traditional risk factor burden or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of olpasiran in healthy Japanese and non-Japanese participants: results from a phase I, single-dose, open-label study [^c693a79e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Olpasiran, an N-acetyl galactosamine-conjugated, hepatocyte-targeted, small interfering RNA, is being developed to reduce plasma lipoprotein (Lp)-(a) concentration by directly targeting the LPA gene. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of a single SC injection of olpasiran in healthy, Japanese and non-Japanese participants.

Methods

In this Phase I, open-label, parallel-design study, Japanese participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a single 3, 9, 75, or 225 mg dose of olpasiran. Non-Japanese participants received a single 75 mg dose of olpasiran. The primary end points were pharmacokinetic parameters, including C max, AUC inf, t max, and t 1/2. Tolerability and change in Lp(a) concentration were also assessed.

Findings

A total of 27 enrolled participants had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (12.5) years. Olpasiran C max and AUC inf were increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in the Japanese groups. Mean (SD) C max values were 242 (121.0) and 144 (71.3) ng/mL, and mean (SD) AUC inf values were 3550 (592.0) and 2620 (917.0) h·ng/mL, in the Japanese and non-Japanese groups, respectively, given 75 mg of olpasiran. Median t max ranged from 3.0 to 9.0 hours and mean (SD) t 1/2 ranged from 4.0 (0.3) to 6.9 (1.6) hours across all groups. The maximal Lp(a) reduction occurred at day 57, with mean (SD) Lp(a) percentage reductions from baseline ranging from 56.0% (21.0%) to 99.0% (0.2%). A reductions in Lp(a) was observed as early as day 4. All adverse events were mild in severity, with no serious or fatal adverse events. No clinically important changes in tolerability-related laboratory analytes or vital signs were observed.

Implications

In this population of healthy Japanese participants, dose-proportional increases in exposure and reduced Lp(a) in a dose-dependent manner were found with single 3, 9, 75, and 225 mg doses of olpasiran. The magnitude and durability of Lp(a) reductions were similar between the Japanese and non-Japanese groups. Olpasiran was well tolerated, with no clinically important adverse events or laboratory or vital sign abnormalities.

ACC nonstatin therapy — clinician–patient discussion factors emphasize assessing percentage LDL-C reduction on evidence-based statin therapy and, if "if < 50% and not on maximally tolerated statin, should increase statin therapy first and reinforce lifestyle modifications", determining whether the patient is above LDL-C thresholds for nonstatin consideration; determining in ASCVD whether the patient is "very high risk or not very high risk"; for patients "without ASCVD or baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL", considering baseline predicted "10-year ASCVD risk" and risk-enhancing factors; reviewing "available scientific evidence of ASCVD risk reduction" with nonstatin add-on; estimating "additional expected % LDL-C lowering" and "mean percentage LDL-C lowering" with the proposed agent; and incorporating cost and patient preferences including "out-of-pocket cost" and factors such as "convenience", potential impact on "adherence", "cost", and "anticipated life expectancy, comorbidities, and impact of therapy on quality of life".

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^e0310635]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] — measurement is supported in defined risk settings. Lp(a) is elevated in approximately 20% of the population and is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Recommendations include using assays calibrated against established reference material and measuring to refine risk when premature ASCVD has occurred in adults (< 55 y of age in men; < 65 y of age in women) in the individual or family. Additionally, persons with primary severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 190 mg/dL), suspected familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), or those at very high risk of ASCVD should have Lp(a) measured to better define potential benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy; the 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society Cholesterol Guideline has also identified Lp(a) as a risk enhancer test in patients at intermediate risk.

Lipoprotein apheresis for high Lp(a) — Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for treating high Lp(a) is lipoprotein apheresis, based on observational data, and apheresis is now also approved for use in high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy; because it removes apoB-containing lipoproteins, both LDL-C and Lp(a) are substantially reduced acutely but return toward pretreatment levels between procedures, and apheresis is not available at all centers and can be expensive and time-consuming.

### Comprehensive evaluation of siRNA therapeutics on Lp (a): a network meta-analysis [^86b47dd6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of siRNA drugs that lower Lp(a) in patients with dyslipidaemia.

Materials and Methods

A network meta-analysis and systematic review were conducted to compare siRNA drugs targeting Lp(a), based on relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (up to October 24, 2024). RCTs with an intervention duration of at least 12weeks were included. Eligible studies compared siRNA drugs that reduce Lp(a), including both Lp(a)-targeted and non-targeted agents, with placebo or other siRNA drugs that reduce Lp(a). The primary outcomes were the percentage reduction and absolute reduction in Lp(a), percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), percentage reduction in apolipoprotein B (apo(B)), adverse events and serious adverse events, including injection-site reactions. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (ROB2), and a random-effects network meta-analysis was performed using the frequentist approach. Confidence in effect estimates was evaluated using the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework.

Results

A total of 14 trials involving 5646 participants were included. Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents, particularly Olpasiran, demonstrated strong efficacy in significantly reducing Lp(a) levels, with the greatest percentage reduction in Lp(a) (mean difference [MD]: -92.06%; 95% CI: -102.43% to -81.69%; P-score: 0.98). Olpasiran also showed the greatest absolute reduction in Lp(a) (MD: -250.70nmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -279.89 to -221.50; P-score: 0.99). Certain non-Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents, such as inclisiran and zodasiran, also showed modest reductions in Lp(a) levels, reducing Lp(a) by approximately 15%. Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents reduced LDL-C by more than 20% and decreased apo(B) by approximately 15%. In terms of safety, most drugs exhibited favourable safety profiles with no significant differences compared to placebo. However, zerlasiran raised concerns regarding injection-site reactions and other adverse events when compared to placebo.

Conclusions

Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents have shown robust effectiveness in substantially reducing Lp(a) levels, including both percentage and absolute reductions, with moderate improvements in LDL-C and apo(B) concentrations. Non-Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents also demonstrate modest reductions in Lp(a) levels. The safety profile is generally favourable, but zerlasiran and inclisiran may increase the incidence of injection-site reactions.

Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

### Personalized cardiovascular disease prevention by applying individualized prediction of treatment effects [^3a546fe9]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Large-scale randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and anti-platelet therapy to prevent cardiovascular diseases. A challenge for clinicians is to apply group-level evidence from these trials to individual patients. Trials typically report a single treatment effect estimate which is the average effect of all participants, comprising patients who respond poorly, intermediately, and well. Clinicians would preferably make patient-tailored treatment decisions. Therefore, one would require an estimate of an individual patient's response to therapy. Although not yet widely recognized, trials contain this type of information. In this paper, we show how available information from landmark trials can be translated to an individual 'treatment score' through the use of multivariable therapeutic prediction models. These models provide an individual estimate of the absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular events given the specific combination of multiple clinical characteristics of a patient under care. Based on this individualized treatment estimate and metrics such as the individual number-needed-to-treat, clinicians together with their patients can decide whether drug treatment or what treatment intensity is worthwhile. Selective treatment of those who can anticipate the greatest benefit and the least harm on an individualized basis could reduce the number of unnecessary treatments and healthcare costs beyond that currently achievable by subgroup analyses based on single patient characteristics.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^cfdb4c8f]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In previous studies by Farmakis and Yu, an Lp(a) reduction between 25% and 35% led to a clinically significant coronary heart disease risk reduction, and our data show that monoclonal antibody based PCSK9i reduces Lp(a) level in the same range (−27%).

Although studies have shown that a higher degree of absolute Lp(a) lowering (at least 50 mg/dL or 105 nmol/L) may be needed for a significant coronary heart disease risk reduction, data from ODYSSEY Outcomes trial subanalysis showed the contrary. Even a 1 mg/dL reduction in Lp(a) was associated with a HR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99–0.00; P = 0.008). Trials on cardiovascular outcomes with Lp(a) reduction using directly targeting Lp(a) therapies such as the Lp(a)HORIZON and OCEAN(a) Outcomes trial are still ongoing, but they have shown reductions in Lp(a) level in the range of 80% to 95%. Findings in these trials will help better understand the optimal absolute reduction in Lp(a) level needed for effective risk reduction.

Study Limitations

There are several limitations that should be noted. This is a study-level meta-analysis, and we could not access individual patient data. Additional limitations include heterogeneity in PCSK9i studies. While we attempted to explain potential reasons for the heterogeneity using subgroup analyses, the lack of disaggregated data precluded further analyses for the matter. Sex and race are important subgroups that were sought from the studies reviewed; unfortunately, our findings show a gross lack of sex disaggregated data to permit subgroup analyses. Future trials should explore these specific disaggregated variables to obtain a deeper understanding of how the treatment effect may vary among these subgroups. Publication bias may also be present, the extent of which could not fully be quantified. Nonetheless, every effort possible was made to limit bias by utilizing a robust analytical approach to adjust for potential moderators through subgroup analyses and meta-regression.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^333e9bc9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) testing in ASCVD risk — recommendation 1.4 states that in adult patients with a family history of premature ASCVD, or a personal history of ASCVD or family history of high Lp(a), we suggest measuring Lp(a) to inform decision-making about short-term and lifetime ASCVD risk and the need to intensify LDL-C–lowering therapy (2⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks add that Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L) enhances risk of ASCVD, Lp(a) testing does not need to be repeated if it has previously been measured (ie, in childhood or early adulthood), and it is not yet known whether reducing Lp(a) reduces ASCVD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^fae8367a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacological treatment in adults — statin-first approach with evidence-based add-ons. Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may benefit from pharmacotherapy, including those with very high baseline LDL-C levels suggestive of a genetic cause such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), individuals with multiple risk factors for ASCVD, or those already diagnosed with ASCVD. Statin therapy, which is the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for LDL-C reduction, reduces ASCVD risk in most individuals, and based on meta-analysis of 27 statin RCTs, for every 1 mmol/L (∼39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C there is a corresponding 22% reduction in ASCVD event risk. It should be noted that statin therapy does not seem to reduce ASCVD in adults receiving hemodialysis or those who have significant heart failure, and stopping statin therapy in these individuals is not advised if it is well tolerated. Given variability in individual response even at full therapeutic doses, routine monitoring for both efficacy and tolerability is essential to guide ongoing management. Based upon contemporary clinical trial evidence, LDL-C lowering therapy should start with statins, then if response is incomplete or a tolerated statin regimen cannot be found, nonstatin LDL-C lowering pharmacotherapy should be considered, with medicine selection based on factors including safety, tolerability, LDL-C lowering efficacy, RCT evidence supporting use, desirable LDL-C and expectations of treatment, patient preference, convenience and cost of therapy, and availability. Nonstatin pharmacotherapy also reduces ASCVD risk, with randomized trials showing risk reduction when ezetimibe is added to moderate intensity statin and when proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody inhibition (PCSK9i) is added to high-intensity statin therapy. Additional options include bempedoic acid, which has demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in high-risk adults (especially those with diabetes mellitus) on low dose or no statin because of intolerance, and high dose icosapent ethyl, which has minimal impact on LDL-C but demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in adults with established ASCVD or high-risk patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia. While niacin is no longer recommended as a routine therapy for LDL-C lowering or ASCVD risk reduction due to lack of incremental benefit when added to statins in contemporary trials, it may have a limited role and may be considered in rare cases of multidrug intolerance or if cost or access constraints limit other options. Bile acid sequestrants can be used but have a high degree of limiting side effects and have been mostly abandoned because of their side effects and modest potency.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at very high risk — escalation beyond statins is guided by on-treatment response and shared decision-making. In patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy with less-than-anticipated response defined by < 50% reduction in LDL-C, routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the patient still has < 50% reduction in LDL-C, the patient and clinician should have a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin therapy to maximally tolerated statin therapy. If adding a nonstatin is chosen, the addition of either ezetimibe or a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as the initial nonstatin therapy should be considered for this very-high-risk patient group. Factors that may favor starting ezetimibe include patients who require < 25% additional lowering of LDL-C and patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) < 3 months, alongside cost, ease of use, and patient preferences; there may be interindividual variability in response to ezetimibe, with some patients experiencing > 20% reduction in LDL-C.

### Design and rationale of the VICTORION-difference study: a phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess inclisiran's early efficacy, safety, tolerability, as well as its impact on quality of life in individuals with hypercholesterolemia [^4a8e9310]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Twice-yearly inclisiran (after the initial and 3-month doses) provides effective and sustained low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in individuals with hyperlipidemia with a favorable long-term safety profile. Limited studies have assessed the impact of inclisiran on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalent. The VICTORION-Difference study will evaluate the early efficacy, safety, and QoL outcomes with inclisiran compared to placebo on top of individually optimized lipid-lowering therapy.

Methods and Analysis

This phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial includes participants aged ≥ 18 years with hypercholesterolemia at high or very high cardiovascular (CV) risk despite being treated with an individualized maximally tolerated statin dose. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous injections of 300-mg inclisiran sodium (equivalent to 284-mg inclisiran) or placebo. In addition to the treatment with inclisiran/placebo, open-label rosuvastatin (starting dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) is sequentially and optimally titrated to the maximally tolerated dose, if the individual LDL-C goals are not achieved. The primary objective is to assess the achievement of LDL-C goals at day 90. Secondary objectives include the assessment of muscle-related adverse events, pain-related QoL scores, and mean LDL-C reduction.

Ethics and Dissemination

The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and other scientific forums to inform clinical practice and future research in the field of hypercholesterolemia and CV disease management.

Inclisiran clinical considerations describe a mechanism of action targeting PCSK9 production and LDL receptor upregulation to reduce LDL-C, an approved role as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH or ASCVD) who require additional LDL-C lowering, a recommended dose of 284 mg administered by a health care professional as a single subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter, and twice a year dosing viewed as attractive for adherence but associated with large costs and additional administrative burdens with potential negative equity impacts; despite LDL-C reduction and FDA approval for lowering LDL-C, limited evidence prevented determining the balance of cardiovascular and mortality benefits versus harms, and longer-term cardiovascular outcomes trials are needed.

Randomized controlled trials including OSLER and ODYSSEY LONG TERM have demonstrated effectiveness for reducing LDL-C and non-HDL-C by ~60% among patients at high cardiovascular risk receiving maximum tolerated statin doses and among patients at various degrees of cardiovascular risk receiving standard therapy, with both studies providing data over approximately 1 year.

### Generalizability of the FOURIER trial to routine clinical care: Do trial participants represent patients in everyday practice? [^ff7b3ccd]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the FOURIER trial, evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We aimed to examine how closely patients in routine practice resemble the FOURIER trial participants and to assess the observed cardiovascular risks based on trial eligibility and underrepresentativeness.

Methods

Using a large US administrative database with linked laboratory data, we identified adult patients with ASCVD between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016. We identified the excluded and underrepresented populations and examined the risk of cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, angina, and coronary revascularization) based on trial eligibility and underrepresentativeness.

Results

Only 15.2% of 233,977 patients met the FOURIER eligibility. Nearly 60% of the ineligible patients met at least 2 exclusion criteria. Among trial-eligible patients, elderly patients, women, minorities, and those without prior MI were underrepresented in FOURIER. Patients who would have been excluded from FOURIER had a diverse risk profile but, on average, had a lower cardiovascular risk than those who would have qualified (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84 [0.81–0.88], P < .001). Among the underrepresented patients, women and patients without prior MI had a lower cardiovascular risk (HR 0.77 [0.71–0.82], P < .001; HR 0.67 [0.63–0.72], P < .001, respectively). Only 47.2% of patients were on moderate-/high-intensity statins.

Conclusions

One in 7 ASCVD patients in practice would have qualified for FOURIER. The excluded and underrepresented populations were at a particularly low or high cardiovascular risk. Statin therapy was underused, and physicians may need to evaluate adherence before adding a proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitor.

### Patient characteristics and acute cardiovascular event rates among patients with very high-risk and non-very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^847abfb3]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the majority of patients with ≥ 1 previous major ASCVD event qualified as VHR ASCVD in real‐world US clinical practice. In patients with VHR ASCVD, LLT utilization rates were relatively low and LDL‐C was suboptimally controlled, even in patients receiving high‐intensity statins and/or ezetimibe treatment. Application of the ACC/AHA 2018 guideline VHR ASCVD criteria was able to identify patients with higher rates of overall major CV events (compared with those not meeting the VHR ASCVD criteria), who would therefore derive the greatest absolute benefit from more intensive LDL‐C lowering.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^c5167ba3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) screening and risk across populations: We recommend measuring Lp(a) in every adult at least once for cardiovascular risk assessment (see Table 1; COR I, LOE B-NR). The risk for ASCVD events that is associated with Lp(a) is independent of LDL-C and is attributed to the atherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties of Lp(a), and Lp(a) is associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD even in the absence of a family history of heart disease. Systematic universal Lp(a) screening can improve health outcomes by increasing awareness of, and enabling precision in, ASCVD prevention strategies and individualization of therapy selection. Elevated Lp(a) remains a risk factor for ASCVD even with aggressive LDL-C lowering by statins and nonstatins (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and ezetimibe), and early, and more-intensive management of modifiable risk factors, including LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, is warranted in at-risk patients who have elevated Lp(a). This update also notes that elevated Lp(a) is not a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that in the pediatric population (children < 18 years of age) elevation of Lp(a) has been linked to the occurrence of arterial ischemic stroke.

Icosapent ethyl in REDUCE-IT — non–HDL-C change versus event reduction — shows that the placebo-corrected reduction in non–HDL-C at year 1 was 15.5 mg/dL (0.37 mmol/L); meta-regression indicates each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in non–HDL-C relates to 20% (95% CI: 18%–23%, n = 19 trials) with statins and 21% (95% CI: 12%–29%, n = 8 trials) with fibrates, so the expected relative risk reduction would be ~8.8%, which is well below the 21.8% observed and the HR risk reduction of 24.8%, and therefore "it is reasonable to hypothesize that the risk reduction may be attributable, in part, to mechanisms other than effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins".

Primary prevention — high-risk patients aged 40 to 75 years: For those at high (> 20%) 10-year estimated ASCVD risk, consideration of high-intensity statin therapy to achieve ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL) is recommended; if on a high-intensity statin there is < 50% reduction or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; in high-risk primary prevention patients, if ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) is not achieved, the addition of ezetimibe may be considered; the writing committee does not routinely recommend PCSK9 mAbs in this patient population.

### Longer-term efficacy and safety of evinacumab in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia [^3fd276f0]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Results of the 48-week OLTP of this phase 2 randomized clinical trial demonstrate that evinacumab, 15 mg/kg, Q4W reduced LDL-C level by 45.5% in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia, with reductions sustained through week 72. Patients who switched from DB evinacumab, 5 mg/kg, to evinacumab, 15 mg/kg, had an intensification of the LDL-C-lowering effect; patients who switched from DB placebo had similar efficacy on evinacumab, 15 mg/kg. Evinacumab also reduced other atherogenic lipoproteins during the 48-week OLTP, supporting the observed results from the previously published 24-week DBTP. The safety profile of evinacumab during the OLTP remained consistent with that observed during the DBTP.

The 2022 American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-C lowering in the management of ASCVD risk recommends LDL-C thresholds of less than 55 mg/dL for adults with ASCVD at very high risk, less than 70 mg/dL for adults with ASCVD not at very high risk, and less than 100 mg/dL for adults without clinical ASCVD and baseline LDL-C of 190 mg/dL or greater not due to secondary causes. To note, the definition of refractory hypercholesterolemia used in this study was formulated before these recently recommended LDL-C thresholds. Although each LLT considered standard of care that is used for the treatment of HeFH can contribute to the overall lowering of LDL-C level, a subset of patients do not achieve these recommended LDL-C thresholds, thus remaining at risk for ASCVD. In our study, which included a high proportion of patients with HeFH, 52.5% achieved LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL after treatment with OL evinacumab.

Limitations

Limitations of this study include the small sample size, relatively short treatment duration, and minimal diversity in the racial and ethnic backgrounds of study participants. Currently, evinacumab is approved in the US as an adjunct to other LDL-C–lowering therapies for patients (aged 5 years and older) with homozygous FH. Although acknowledging that long-term intravenous administration of evinacumab could be burdensome for a broader population with refractory hypercholesterolemia, standard-of-care LLTs are insufficient in reducing LDL-C level for a subset of patients, thus indicating a clinical need for novel agents.

Nonstatin therapies and BAS — Choice among nonstatin therapies should account for patient population and therapy attributes; considerations include the extent of available scientific evidence for net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit, safety and tolerability, potential for drug-drug interactions, efficacy of additional LDL-C lowering, cost, convenience and medication storage, pill burden, frequency and route of administration, potential to jeopardize adherence to evidence-based therapies, and, importantly, patient preferences. Before initiation of combination therapy or dose adjustments/additions, it is imperative for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion addressing potential net benefit, absolute ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and potential harms, prescribing considerations, and patient preferences. BAS may be considered as an optional alternative agent for those with ezetimibe intolerance and with triglycerides < 300 mg/dL or due to patient preferences, but there is no evidence for a net cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of BAS in addition to statin therapy.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^958232a8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) measurement — Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) is described as an independent risk factor for ASCVD, yet clinical assays used in patient care are not well standardized; the National Lipid Association recommends an immunochemical assay calibrated against WHO/IFCCLM secondary reference material, with the preferred reporting unit in nmol/L. Reported performance indicates Lp(a) assay variability can be as high as 26% CV and the precision of most Lp(a) assays ranges between 10% to 12%. The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society guideline classified Lp(a) measurement as a risk enhancer that could help guide care for persons at intermediate ASCVD risk, and measuring Lp(a) may also be valuable in patients with a strong family history of ASCVD, those who do not fully respond to statin therapy, or those with ASCVD events despite evidence-based lipid-lowering therapy.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for integrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity treatment: a framework for pragmatic, patient-centered care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^fb6a70a2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and multimorbidity — general clinical assumptions: This ECDP applies to the patient with ASCVD and multimorbidity and is primarily focused on outpatient management; the writing committee endorses ACC/AHA evidence-based approaches but recognizes that stacking disease-specific Clinical Practice Guidelines may lead to unintended consequences and that following all possible recommendations may not be practical. CV clinicians should consider the whole patient and the patient's life expectancy and other patient-specific domains when making treatment decisions, and clinicians should regularly review and reconcile conditions and treatments to prioritize high-value interventions aligned with the patient's goals, priorities, and preferences. Expected benefits, potential harms, and burdens should be considered, priority should often be given to treatments that address multiple conditions, and optimal patient care should reflect the patient's goals and the clinician's medical knowledge. Deprescribing one or more medications or therapies may be the best option for some patients; this ECDP is not intended to supersede good clinical judgment and the treating clinician should seek input as needed. Team-based care should be used to address various treatment domains to attain the best possible outcomes, health systems and clinicians should leverage electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate care coordination among clinicians while promoting patient engagement, and healthcare organizations should advocate for legislative efforts to reward holistic, patient-centered care. This ECDP is based on currently available data and information, and clinicians should incorporate pertinent information published after this ECDP.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^5bef850b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### Independence of lipoprotein (a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^fb26484f]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the continuous association between baseline Lp(a) and ASCVD risk, we modeled the relative risk increase (expressed as a hazard ratio) for ASCVD depending on an individual's baseline Lp(a) level, compared with a reference level of 5 mg/dL, separately for patients on placebo or statin using generalized additive Cox models. A key advantage of generalized additive models is their flexibility in effect modeling of continuous covariates without imposing a specific parametric form, whereas smoothing is enforced (and overfitting avoided) because of penalization. The models were adjusted for the covariates listed previously, included the interaction between baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C, and were stratified by trial and treatment assignment.

To investigate whether baseline Lp(a) affects the association between baseline LDL-C and ASCVD risk, we used Cox proportional hazards models with an interaction term for baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C, adjusted for the covariates listed previously, stratified by trial and treatment assignment, and included a study-specific random-effect term for Lp(a). This analysis was performed in the overall cohort and separately for those assigned placebo or statin. As a sensitivity analysis, the association between baseline LDL-C level and ASCVD risk was evaluated using LDL-C corrected for the component of Lp(a) cholesterol. A range of correction factors from 20% to 45% was used by subtracting 20% to 45% of Lp(a) mass from LDL-C.

We evaluated the association between categories of baseline Lp(a) and statin-achieved LDL-C with ASCVD risk in statin-treated individuals. In this analysis, participants were categorized by baseline Lp(a) dichotomized at 50 mg/dL (≈125 nmol/L) and by achieved LDL-C quartiles. A threshold of 50 mg/dL for Lp(a) was chosen, as current guidelines define levels above this threshold as elevated or high risk. Again, models were adjusted for the covariates listed previously and stratified by trial. We also categorized individuals by baseline Lp(a) level and (study-specific and overall) quartile of absolute change in LDL-C level with statin therapy. We performed multiple sensitivity analyses. We categorized participants based on a study-specific median achieved LDL-C level, by an achieved LDL-C threshold of 100 or 55 mg/dL, or by statin-achieved Lp(a) and LDL-C levels. Observed event rates per 100 person-years were calculated.

### Testing cardiovascular drug safety and efficacy in randomized trials [^a3ad636c]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Randomized trials provide the gold standard evidence on which rests the decision to approve novel therapeutics for clinical use. They are large and expensive and provide average but unbiased estimates of efficacy and risk. Concern has been expressed about how unrepresentative populations and conditions that pertain in randomized trials might be of the real world, including concerns about the homogeneity of the biomedical and adherence characteristics of volunteers entered into such trials, the dose and constancy of drug administration and the mixture of additional medications that are restricted in such trials but might influence outcome in practice. A distinction has been drawn between trials that establish efficacy and those that demonstrate effectiveness, drugs that patients actually consume in the real world for clinical benefit. However, randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for establishing efficacy and the testing of effectiveness with less rigorous approaches is a secondary, albeit important consideration. Despite this, there is an appreciation that average results may conceal considerable interindividual variation in drug response, leading to a failure to appreciate clinical value or risk in subsets of patients. Thus, attempts are now being made to individualize risk estimates by modulating those derived from large randomized trials with the individual baseline risk estimates based on demographic and biological criteria-the individual Numbers Needed to Treat to obtain a benefit, such as a life saved. Here, I will consider some reasons why large phase 3 trials-by far the most expensive element of drug development-may fail to address the unmet medical needs, which should justify such effort and investment.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^cddff7c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonstatin LDL-cholesterol therapy sequencing and thresholds — It is reasonable to engage in a clinician-patient discussion regarding a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (mAb), including administration by subcutaneous injection and the every 14-day or monthly dosing schedule. In some patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL who require greater LDL-C reduction than any additional agent alone can expect to achieve, it may be reasonable to consider the simultaneous addition of 2 agents. If additional LDL-C lowering is desired (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) after addition of ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 mAb, it is reasonable to engage in discussion of bempedoic acid; considerations include a mean expected reduction of approximately 17%, and bempedoic acid should be used in caution with patients who have a history of gout or tendon rupture. At the current time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice; the ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are anticipated to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those who may be unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran. There is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy in LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran; therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be in place of a PCSK9 mAb. If a patient has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin with or without ezetimibe and/or bempedoic acid and is considered for prescription of inclisiran, referral should be made to a lipid specialist, and if combination statin and nonstatin therapy with ezetimibe, PCSK9 mAb, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran has been attempted and the patient still meets these thresholds, the writing committee recommends referral to a lipid specialist and RD/RDN.

National Lipid Association consensus — apoB treatment thresholds and clinical application — states that thresholds for initiating or intensifying pharmacotherapy for apoB levels are not as well-established compared to LDL-C and non-HDL-C; however, based on evidence from untreated populations and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in individuals on lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), apoB thresholds for very high, high, and borderline to intermediate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk are suggested to be 60, 70, and 90 mg/dL, respectively, to correspond with current LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment thresholds; it adds that lowering apoB and non-HDL-C can be achieved with nutritional and other lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy, and that apoB testing provides information relevant to prognosis, treatment expectations, and the need for family cascade screening.

### CONSORT-DEFINE explanation and elaboration: recommendations for enhancing reporting quality and impact of early phase dose-finding clinical trials [^da3df49b]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Explanation

Expansion cohorts can enhance understanding of the toxicity profile, pharmacology, or effects on other biomarkers. They may also be used to obtain preliminary evidence of activity to justify progression to future studies (e.g. phase I to II). Expansion cohorts could allocate more participants to selected dose levels or subgroup/disease-specific cohorts. Clearly stating the objectives of the expansion cohort(s), as well as providing information on whether their sample size is statistically justified (item 7a) and whether predefined criteria to inform go/no-go decisions (item 7b) about the clinical development of the intervention exist, will help the reader to understand the questions that the expansion cohorts are designed to answer.

Authors should specify how they determined which dose(s) to expand, how many participants were treated at the selected dose(s) in each expansion cohort and the objectives of the expansion cohort(s). They should state whether backfill cohorts (defined as additional participants being allocated to doses already deemed safe to collect further information on safety profile, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, or activity)were permitted to be opened in parallel to the dose-finding part and how their data would be used to inform subsequent interim trial adaptations and the final recommended dose(s).

Item 3a.11 [modified] Criteria for progression to the next part of the trial (e.g. phase 1 to phase 2, single ascending dose to multiple ascending dose), where applicable

Example 1

"Doses were escalated in a sequential fashion contingent on the safety and PK [pharmacokinetics] profiles of at least 4 subjects who had received GSK3389404 at the previous dose levels up to and including day 4 postdose. Once all subjects in cohort D had reached day 4 with an acceptable safety profile, part 2 of the study was initiated".

The criteria for progressing to the next part of the trial as described in this example are supplemented by a trial design schema in Figure 2 in Han et al. used under CC BY-NC 4.0 (Fig. 2 c).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Primary prevention — patients declining or intolerant of statins: In patients who may not wish to take a statin or may not tolerate the recommended intensity, it may be reasonable to use LDL-C–lowering drugs proven safe and effective in RCTs (monotherapy or combined with a statin); consideration may be given to use of ezetimibe; BAS may be considered as an optional alternative for those with ezetimibe intolerance and with triglycerides < 300 mg/dL, but there is no evidence for a cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of BAS in addition to statins; given the marginal additional benefit for this lower-risk group, the writing committee does not recommend routine use of nonstatin therapy for primary prevention patients with ASCVD risk < 20%.

### Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a review [^f83cdda2]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) reduce cardiovascular events in at-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes. Despite these findings, GLP-1RAs are underused in eligible patients, particularly by cardiologists.

Observations

To date, randomized clinical trials of albiglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and injectable semaglutide have reported favorable cardiovascular outcomes. Most recently approved for clinical use, oral semaglutide has a favorable safety profile and is currently undergoing regulatory evaluation and further study for cardiovascular outcomes. Professional society guidelines now recommend GLP-1RA therapy for cardiovascular risk mitigation in patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple ASCVD risk factors, independent of glucose control or background antihyperglycemic therapy (other diabetes medications being used). Additional conditions suitable for GLP-1RA therapy include obesity and advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), for which cardiovascular risk-reducing options are limited. Out-of-pocket costs and secondary advantages (eg, weight loss) may inform shared decision-making discussions regarding potential therapies. GLP-1RA therapy has a favorable safety profile. Its most common adverse effect is gastrointestinal upset, which typically wanes during the early weeks of therapy and may be mitigated by starting at the lowest dose and escalating as tolerated. Depending on baseline glycemic control, sulfonylureas and insulin may need to be decreased before GLP-1RA initiation; without concurrent use of insulin or sulfonylureas, GLP-1RAs are not associated with hypoglycemia. Multidisciplinary follow-up and collaborative care with primary care physicians and/or endocrinologists are important.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings from this review suggest that GLP-1RAs are safe, are well tolerated, and improve cardiovascular outcomes, largely independent of their antihyperglycemic properties, but they remain underused by cardiologists. This review provides a practical resource for cardiologists for initiating GLP-1RAs and managing the therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or high risk for ASCVD.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1d011761]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^8be4876d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk stratification — risk factor count categories and quantitative risk scoring — specifies to classify patients as low risk with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factor, moderate risk with 2 major ASCVD risk factors, and high risk with ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; for risk refinement, particularly in patients with moderate risk, consider quantitative risk scoring using thresholds to classify high risk of ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard coronary heart disease (CHD) event by the ATP III Framingham risk calculator, ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event by the Pooled Cohort Equations (ACC/AHA), and ≥ 45% risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) by the Framingham long-term (30 year) risk calculator, and note that additional indicators may warrant moving a patient into a higher risk category based on clinical judgment, including coronary artery calcium (CAC; ≥ 300 Agatston units), LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and/or non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L, Lp (a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (protein) using an isoform-insensitive assay, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g.

Icosapent ethyl — REDUCE-IT trial outcomes and applicability are as follows: Icosapent ethyl is a purified ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and at the time of the review evidence for critical CV outcomes was limited to a single randomized trial; in the double-blinded, placebo-controlled REDUCE-IT trial, treatment with 4 grams of icosapent ethyl resulted in a 25% reduction in the composite primary endpoint over 4.9 years (NNT = 21). Study participants were largely high risk, with 70% having a history of CVD, and eligibility included elevated TG levels (median 216 mg/dL, 90% of patients > 150 mg/dL) while 90% were on stable moderate- to high-dose statins for at least four weeks before the intervention. A similar 26% reduction in the secondary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke was observed (NNT = 28). Safety findings included increased hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (3.1% versus 2.1%; absolute risk increase [ARI]: 1%; NNH = 100; p = 0.004) and a higher rate of serious bleeding events (ARI: 0.6%; p = 0.06) in the icosapent ethyl treatment arm.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^1c5fe674]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in reproductive-age women — key drivers: ASCVD is driven by cardiovascular risk factors, with standard risk factors such as age, sex, race, apoB-containing lipoprotein levels, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking status being well documented. Emerging metrics, including elevated Lp(a), and inflammatory markers, such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein, are also likely markers of risk. For most individuals, advancing age is the most important driver of ASCVD risk; however, in some young individuals, a single severe risk factor leads to high cardiovascular risk, and the most common single severe risk factor that drives ASCVD risk in young patients is heterozygous FH.

### Lipoprotein apheresis for lipoprotein (a)-associated progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: 12-years follow-up [^aa331ab9]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) associated with high Lp(a) (> 60 mg/dl) has been approved as indication for regular lipoprotein apheresis (LA) in Germany since 2008.

Methods

This observational multicenter study enrolled 170 consecutive patients with high Lp(a) and progressive ASCVD despite effective treatment of other ASCVD risk factors as required for approval of reimbursement to analyse the long-term effect of LA on cardiovascular event rates. Additionally cardiovascular event rates were compared to an appropriate UK-Biobank cohort (UKBBC) with established ASCVD and verified impact of elevated Lp(a) on ASCVD risk.

Results

Investigations were conducted on patients retrospectively over a 5-year period before the initiation of regular LA, prospectively 5 years after the commencement of LA, and again retrospectively until the completion of 12 years of LA. 154 patients (90.6%) completed 5 years follow-up, 129 patients (75.9%) were available in year 12. A decline in the mean annual rate of cardiovascular events per patient was observed from y-5 to y-1 (0.27 ± 0.25) versus y+1 until y+12 (0.06 ± 0.08) (p < 0.001). One year before commencing LA mean event rates per 100 patient years of the primary composite endpoint parameter of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including nonfatal ischemic stroke (IS) were significantly higher in Pro(a)LiFe patients compared to the UKBBC. Most importantly they were significantly lower one year after commencing LA.

Conclusions

Regular LA was associated with a decreased rate of cardiovascular events in patients with high Lp(a) (> 60 mg/dl) and progressive ASCVD up to 12 years. Comparison with corresponding incidence rates in the UKBBC supports the clinical efficacy of LA to bring progressive ASCVD associated with high Lp(a) to a halt. However, this comparative analysis cannot replace a true control group or determine the exact effect size.

### Population impact&efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^4575bee1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins are effective at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease events. 1 Current guidelines recommend primary prevention with statins targeted according to a person's estimated 10‐year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events (myocardial infarction, fatal and nonfatal stroke, or coronary heart disease death) with a treatment threshold of 7.5%, such that statins are recommended for all persons with 10‐year risk > 7.5%. 2 Some have proposed targeting therapy instead according to the expected benefit from statins (measured by the absolute reduction in risk of events expected from statin therapy). 3 Whereas baseline risk is a good marker for expected benefit, the expected benefit may also depend on individual characteristics that modify statin effectiveness (eg, a person with very low baseline lipid levels might have moderately high baseline ASCVD risk, but relatively low expected benefit from statins 1). Benefit‐targeted primary prevention with statins may therefore be more efficient than risk‐targeted primary prevention.

It is unclear, however, how much a switch to benefit‐targeted statin therapy from risk‐targeted statin therapy would actually benefit the US population. A previous analysis projected that switching from risk‐targeted statin therapy with a baseline risk treatment threshold of 7.5% to benefit‐targeted statin therapy with an expected absolute risk reduction (ARR) treatment threshold of 2.3% could lead to treatment of an additional 9.5 million Americans and prevent an additional 266 508 cardiovascular events over 10 years 3; but an equivalent impact could be obtained by simply lowering the baseline risk treatment threshold and treating more lower‐risk people. Lowering the treatment threshold would reduce prevention efficiency to some extent, but the degree is unclear. A direct comparison of the efficiency of benefit‐targeted versus risk‐targeted statin therapy at equivalent‐impact treatment thresholds has not yet been presented.

We used the open‐source Prevention Impact and Efficiency Model 4 to illustrate and evaluate the impact‐efficiency trade‐offs of risk‐targeted versus benefit‐targeted statin therapy. We specifically evaluated efficiency of these strategies over a range of equivalent‐impact treatment thresholds, and compared the efficiency gains from benefit‐targeted statin therapy with gains that might be expected from improved risk prediction or from more‐efficacious prevention (ie, higher‐intensity statin therapy), and put results in the context of the Healthy People 2020 impact objective of reducing cardiovascular disease deaths by 20%. 5

### Contemporary national patterns of eligibility and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies in the United States [^9018fc3d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Statins have remained a mainstay of prevention and treatment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The emergence of novel lipid‐targeted therapies, such as PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors) and icosapent ethyl (IPE), has expanded therapeutic options to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 2018 lipid management guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have recommended the use of adjunctive nonstatin agents such as PCSK9i for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with established or high‐risk ASCVD. These recommendations, in addition to the updated statement recommending IPE use by the National Lipid Association, are based on evidence from large clinical trials that demonstrated improvement of cardiovascular outcomes in high‐risk patients receiving PCSK9i, and IPE, as adjunct therapies to statins.

Despite approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and recommendation by clinical practice guidelines, the proportion of the US population that has compelling indications for these novel agents has largely remained unknown. This is a particularly important knowledge gap given the early evidence of limited uptake of PCSK9i in clinical practiceand the emergence of IPE as an additional risk‐lowering therapy in patients with elevated triglyceride levels. In the absence of high‐quality data on the real‐world use of these medications, an unbiased assessment of the eligibility and use of PCSK9i and IPE is necessary to inform strategies for their broader clinical use and to maximize their public health benefits.

In this contemporary, national study of the US population from 2017 to 2020, we assessed the eligibility and use of PCSK9i and IPE across indications by clinical practice guidelines. We also assessed the estimated number of individuals who would benefit from PCSK9i and IPE after maximal initiation and escalation of their baseline lipid‐lowering therapies by applying known distributions of lipid profile changes derived from clinical trials that evaluated these agents.
