## Question

I am confused about the straight leg test. Is the test positive for radiculopathy with pain down the leg when raising the leg or is the test positive with pain in the lower back indicating radiculopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a straight leg raise (SLR) test, specifically whether a positive result for radiculopathy is indicated by pain radiating down the leg or by pain in the lower back. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct definition and technique of the SLR. Then, I should verify what constitutes a positive test and how angle matters. Next, I will distinguish radicular leg pain from axial back pain and clarify the crossed SLR. After that, I should review diagnostic performance and limitations, including false positives and negatives. Finally, I will integrate SLR into a broader clinical context and summarize the bottom line with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the test itself. The SLR is performed with the patient supine, the hip flexed while the knee is kept extended, passively raising the limb to tension the L4–S1 nerve roots. A positive test is typically defined as reproduction of the patient's typical lower-extremity radicular pain between about 30 and 70 degrees of hip flexion, whereas reproduction of isolated low back pain is not considered a positive SLR for radiculopathy [^111sJMPi] [^116y6XEv].

> Wait, let me verify the interpretation nuance. I initially thought "any pain" during SLR might suffice, but hold on, that would conflate somatic referred pain with radicular pain. The correct interpretation is that a positive SLR for radiculopathy requires reproduction of the patient's radiating leg pain in a dermatomal distribution, not just back pain, and if raising the opposite leg reproduces the patient's leg pain, that is a positive crossed SLR, which is more specific though less sensitive than the ipsilateral SLR [^111sJMPi] [^1136ySRX].

> I need to check the biomechanical rationale to ensure this makes sense. The SLR tensions the sciatic nerve and the lumbosacral nerve roots. MRI studies show caudal displacement of neural structures during SLR, supporting the mechanism that leg symptoms reflect dural and root mechanosensitivity rather than purely local back pain generators, which is why leg-dominant reproduction is the meaningful positive sign [^112kEwpJ] [^114t5JfS].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance so I don't overstate certainty. In surgical populations with high prevalence, SLR sensitivity is high but specificity is low. Pooled estimates show sensitivity around 0.92 and specificity around 0.28, whereas in imaging-correlated cohorts sensitivity is lower and more variable, roughly 0.67 in one study, underscoring that a negative SLR does not exclude radiculopathy and a positive SLR is not pathognomonic for herniation [^1136ySRX] [^1166zCaE] [^114VET7B]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives; the slump test can be more sensitive but less specific than SLR, and combining neurodynamic tests with neurologic signs improves diagnostic yield, though no single maneuver is definitive in isolation [^111dwV85] [^1136ySRX].

> I will now examine limitations and mimics so I don't jump to conclusions. False positives can occur with hamstring tightness, piriformis syndrome, hip pathology, and other musculoskeletal conditions, and false negatives occur when loss of function predominates over mechanosensitivity, so neurodynamic tests can be negative despite confirmed nerve root compromise. This is why SLR should be interpreted alongside dermatomal sensory changes, myotomal weakness, and reflex asymmetries rather than in isolation [^114zWm4h] [^115sYns1] [^116Wc2xp]. But wait, what if the pain is purely axial during SLR? That pattern is more consistent with somatic referred pain from discs or facet joints rather than radiculopathy, reinforcing that isolated back pain on SLR should not be labeled a positive nerve root tension sign [^111wjTRA].

> Let me consider the crossed SLR specifically. I should confirm that crossed SLR, where raising the unaffected leg reproduces the patient's contralateral leg pain, is less sensitive but more specific for significant central or large disc herniation. Pooled specificity is around 0.90 with low sensitivity, so a positive crossed SLR meaningfully increases the likelihood of a substantial compressive lesion even though it is not highly sensitive [^1136ySRX] [^114VET7B].

> Next, I should review how to integrate SLR into the full clinical picture. A positive SLR supports the presence of neural tissue mechanosensitivity and, when aligned with dermatomal pain, myotomal weakness, and reflex changes, strengthens the case for radiculopathy. However, imaging correlation and, when needed, electrodiagnostics can refine localization and confirm physiologic compromise, especially when the examination is equivocal or when surgical decisions hinge on level-specific pathology [^113WKSAb] [^112gAcTu]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions. Major guidelines emphasize history and exam to triage imaging and procedures, cautioning against overreliance on any single physical test and recommending imaging primarily when red flags or progressive deficits are present or when conservative care fails [^113MwM4Q] [^113BXcmc].

> Let me reconsider the original confusion to ensure clarity. The SLR is positive for radiculopathy when it reproduces the patient's typical radiating leg pain between roughly 30 and 70 degrees; reproduction of isolated low back pain during SLR is not considered a positive test for radiculopathy, though it may still be clinically informative for other pain generators, and a negative SLR does not rule out radiculopathy, particularly when neurologic deficits or imaging suggest root compromise [^111sJMPi] [^1136ySRX] [^114VET7B].

> Bottom line, I should double-check that my summary aligns with evidence. SLR positivity hinges on reproducing dermatomal leg pain with the maneuver, not back pain; back pain alone suggests somatic referred pain rather than nerve root tension, and SLR should be interpreted alongside the rest of the neurologic examination and, when appropriate, imaging or electrodiagnostics to avoid misclassification and to guide management decisions [^116y6XEv] [^116D8nb2] [^113WKSAb].

The straight leg raise (SLR) test is **positive for radiculopathy when it reproduces the patient's typical leg pain** (sciatica) between 30–70 degrees of hip flexion, indicating nerve root tension or compression [^111sJMPi] [^116y6XEv]. Pain confined to the lower back during SLR is **not considered a positive test for radiculopathy** and may reflect local mechanical or muscular causes [^111wjTRA]. A positive SLR is most specific when it reproduces leg pain in a dermatomal pattern and is supported by other neurologic findings (sensory changes, weakness, reflex asymmetry) [^1136ySRX] [^114iDYFe]. The crossed SLR (pain in the opposite leg) is **highly specific** but less sensitive for lumbar disc herniation [^1136ySRX] [^114VET7B].

---

## Clinical technique and interpretation

- **Patient position**: Supine, hip flexed, knee extended, ankle neutral.
- **Maneuver**: Passively raise the leg between 30–70 degrees.
- **Positive test**: Reproduction of typical leg pain (sciatica) in a dermatomal distribution [^111sJMPi] [^116y6XEv].
- **Negative test**: No leg pain or only back pain reproduced [^111wjTRA].

---

## Diagnostic significance

- **Positive SLR**: Suggests nerve root tension or compression, most often from lumbar disc herniation [^1136ySRX] [^111sJMPi].
- **Negative SLR**: Does not exclude radiculopathy; sensitivity is ~67% in imaging-confirmed cases [^1166zCaE] [^1118bpRp].
- **Crossed SLR**: Pain in the opposite leg is highly specific (~88–90%) but less sensitive (~28–29%) for lumbar disc herniation [^1136ySRX] [^114VET7B].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **False positives**: Hamstring tightness, hip pathology, piriformis syndrome, or sacroiliac joint dysfunction can mimic radicular pain [^114zWm4h] [^116Vhiyu].
- **False negatives**: Chronic or mild nerve root compression may not provoke symptoms during SLR [^115sYns1] [^116Wc2xp].
- **Patient factors**: Age, flexibility, and psychosocial factors can influence test results [^1164CN5u] [^117PCaBB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend using the SLR test alongside a comprehensive neurologic examination (sensory, motor, reflexes) to improve diagnostic accuracy [^117AwJYj] [^112iYaL8]. Imaging (MRI) is reserved for persistent or severe cases, or when surgery is considered [^113MwM4Q] [^113pSq1m].

## Interpretation of SLR test

| **Test result** | **Interpretation** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive SLR (leg pain) | Reproduction of typical leg pain in dermatomal distribution | Suggests radiculopathy (nerve root tension/compression) |
| Negative SLR (no leg pain) | No reproduction of leg pain | Does not exclude radiculopathy |
| Positive crossed SLR | Pain in opposite leg | Highly specific for lumbar disc herniation |
| Pain only in lower back | Not considered positive for radiculopathy | Suggests local mechanical or muscular causes |

---

The SLR test is **positive for radiculopathy when it reproduces typical leg pain** in a dermatomal pattern, whereas isolated back pain is not diagnostic of radiculopathy. It should be interpreted with other neurologic findings and imaging when appropriate [^116D8nb2].

Adult isthmic spondylolisthesis — study-based clinical features and evidence appraisal are summarized as follows: Among patients classified by slip grade, 13 patients had a Grade I slip and 2 patients had a Grade II slip. All but one patient had low back pain for an average of 51 months and all had unilateral sciatica for an average of 33 months. On physical examination, 11 patients had restricted mobility of the lumbar spine, 8 patients had positive results for the straight leg raising test, 3 patients had positive results for the crossed straight leg raising test, and one patient had a weakness of the extensor hallucis longus muscle. In critique, the sample size for this study is small and investigators did not utilize statistical methods to analyze results. Due to these reasons, the work group decided to downgrade the level of evidence. This potential level II study provides level III diagnostic evidence that a positive straight leg test was present in about half of the patients and can be consistent with a diagnosis of radiculopathy associated with isthmic spondylolisthesis.

Low back pain — physical examination tests: Special provocative testing and certain neurological examination may not be currently feasible in some clinical encounters performed virtually. The potential benefits of performing relevant physical examination tests (neurological examination of skin sensation, motor strength, tendon reflex testing; Straight Leg Raise or Bragard tests; and Revel's criteria) slightly outweighed the potential harm of additional time burden to the clinician or temporary exacerbation of patients' pain; however, the Work Group was concerned about unintended consequences of increased healthcare utilization and unclear impact on patient management and outcomes, and decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. This is a Reviewed, New-added recommendation and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

Time to triage and surgical consultation

Prior to the intervention, the average time from receipt of referral to triage was 38 days. Among those identified as potential surgical candidates, the time from referral to surgical consultation averaged 56 days. The time from receipt of referral to NP triage averaged 24 days during the 1–3-month postintervention period, while the time from referral to surgical consultation was 60 days. Between 4 and 6 months post-intervention, the time from receipt of referral to triage averaged 21 days and the time from referral to surgical consultation was 64 days.

How to refer

Following the intervention, a significant increase was observed among referrals in the inclusion of motor exam findings (p = 0.03) and the incorporation of reported functional impairments (p = < 0.001) experienced by the patient. However, no change was demonstrated in referral practices when it came to reporting traumatic/inciting incidences. Further, there was no improvement in the inclusion of the neurological exam findings of sensation or reflexes, nor in the performance of an SLR. Among the data recommended for inclusion in a referral letter, they were included in only 21% of referrals cumulatively (figure 2).

Figure 2
Percentage of referrals, including data deemed essential for inclusion in an appropriate referral letter (note that patients in which a finding was deemed not applicable have been removed from this analysis, that is, 'straight leg raise' is unnecessary for those diagnosed with a cervical issue).

Reasons for referral

According to the NP assessments, the distribution of specific diagnoses among all referred patients was as follows: radiculopathy 43% (n = 175), back pain 15% (n = 61), neurogenic claudication 12% (n = 47), myelopathy 5% (n = 22), neck pain 5% (n = 21), peripheral neuropathy 2% (n = 8), spinal instability 2% (n = 7), lesion/tumour 0.7% (n = 3) and fracture 0.5% (n = 2). When comparing NP diagnoses to those listed by the referring physician, an overall agreement of 34% was observed. The diagnosis that referring physicians were most likely to recognise was radiculopathy, demonstrating a 51% agreement compared with clinic NP diagnosis. Other diagnoses showed a much lower level of recognition, as outlined in figure 3.

### Comparison of radicular symptoms caused by lumbar disc herniation and lumbar spinal stenosis in the elderly [^112Rfk7Q]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Comparative study using combined data from 2 prospective cohort studies.

Objective

To expose the differences between the clinical characteristics of neurogenic claudication from magnetic resonance image-documented lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and lumbosacral radicular syndrome from acute, magnetic resonance image-documented, lumbar disc herniation (LDH).

Summary Of Background Data

LSS and LDH are the common lumbar disorders that produce lower extremity pain. Though known factors such as pain induced by walking for LSS and the rapid onset of symptoms for LDH are useful for differentiating these disorders, exploration of differences in other factors has received limited study.

Methods

This study included participants aged 60 yr or older from 2 previous studies. One examined walking limitations caused by LSS and the second the natural history of LDH in elderly adults. The clinical features of both groups were compared by calculating means, medians, and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. χ test was used to explore differences between LSS and LDH for categorical variables, and Student t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.

Results

Participants with LSS had more medical comorbidity, less intense leg pain, and less disability than those with LDH. Leg pain was more common in the anterior thigh, anterior knee and shin in LDH, and in the posterior knee in LSS. Trunk flexion was more impaired in LDH. Positive straight leg raising and femoral stretch signs were common in LDH, and rare in LSS. Abnormal Achilles reflexes were noted more frequently in LSS.

Conclusion

In addition to established factors, greater leg pain intensity, greater disability, and pain in the anterior leg are more common in the elderly with LDH than in the elderly with LSS. Normal trunk flexion, absence of nerve root tension signs and abnormal Achilles reflexes are more common in LSS.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^1138PsNk]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

The panel discussed the application of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain, including the use of several case studies of patients to test operationalisation of the system. This discussion identified differences in the application of the grading system among panel members and highlighted that the further clarification on the interpretation of requirements for possible and probable neuropathic pain was needed in the context of spine-related leg pain. The following challenges and uncertainties to the interpretation of the current grading system were identified by the working group:
(1) The often insidious onset of spine-related leg pain with no clear temporal or spatial relationship with a nerve lesion and how to interpret that in relation to the "history of relevant neurological lesion or disease".
(2) The absence of a clear dermatomal symptom distribution in about two thirds of patients with radicular painand whether such pain presentation would still be considered as "neuroanatomically plausible".
(3) The presence of neuropathic symptom descriptors such as electric shocks, shooting pain, tingling, and pins and needles or aggravating or alleviating factors suggestive of pain relating to a neurological lesion may be the only indications in patients with radicular pain. It remained unclear how much weight would be attributed to these symptoms, especially in the absence of a history of a neurological lesion.
(4) The frequent absence of sensory loss on bedside sensory examination. Sensory loss of function may in few people only be apparent on laboratory quantitative sensory testing, which may not be available in all clinical settings. However, using quantitative sensory testing delineation of borders is not possible, leaving uncertainty about the neuroanatomically plausible distribution of the sensory loss.
(5) The absence of frank sensory loss but presence of thermal hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain/nerve injury, including patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy (∼33%)or mechanical allodynia in patients with lumbar radicular pain with or without radiculopathy. However, gain of function is not necessarily discriminative of neuropathic conditions, as it is also found in nociceptive conditions. A typical example is the widespread mechanical hyperalgesia reported in patients with nonspecific low back pain.
(6) It was unclear to panel members how much weight would be given to "positive" sensory signs in the absence of sensory loss.
(7) Some patients have myotomal loss of function (weakness or reflex reduction) in addition to their pain (e.g. painful motor radiculopathy). This can be indicative of a nerve root lesion, but this is not considered in the current grading system.
(8) The questionable sensitivity of many confirmatory tests to detect nerve involvement in patients with spine-related leg pain. For instance, routine MRI displays about 30% false positives and false negativesand positional dependence seems to influence interpretation (eg, higher nerve root compression grades during standing than the conventional supine position).

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — diagnostic features by lumbar level specify characteristic patterns for nerve root involvement. At L3–4 (nerve root L4), pain involves "Low back; hip; anterolateral thigh; medial leg", numbness is "Anteromedial thigh and knee", atrophy involves "Quadriceps", motor weakness is "Extension of quadriceps", screening uses "Squat and rise", and reflexes show "Knee jerk diminished". At L4–5 (nerve root L5), atrophy is "Minor or nonspecific", motor weakness is "Dorsiflexion of great toe and foot", screening is "Heel walking", and reflexes are "None reliable" [pain and numbness cells present in table but not extracted here]. At L5–S1 (nerve root S1), atrophy is "Gastrocnemius and soleus", motor weakness is "Plantar flexion of great toe and foot", screening is "Walking on toes", and reflexes show "Ankle jerk diminished". The page notes that "A neurologic and musculoskeletal examination may assist in the diagnosis of radiculopathy or radicular pain with identification of disc herniation at various levels", and that "Straight leg raising or cross straight leg raising and motor examination may be crucial in the assessment of disc herniation".

Lumbar Radiculopathies

Radiculopathy is related to inflammation or compression of a nerve root with treatment focused on reducing edema and/or inflammation. Lumbosacral radiculopathy has a constellation of symptoms secondary to mechanical and/or inflammatory involvement of at least one of the lumbosacral nerve roots. These symptoms include radiating pain, numbness, tingling, weakness and possible gait abnormalities of the lower extremities in a particular dermatome or myotome, depending on the nerve root(s) affected.

The incidence of radicular symptoms in patients presenting with low back pain ranges from 12% to 40%. Any process that causes irritation or compression of the spinal nerves can cause radicular symptoms, with the most common etiology being degenerative changes of the spine, followed by trauma and benign or malignant tumors. Evaluation of a patient with radiculopathy starts with a history and physical examination with incorporation of the straight leg test or Lasègue test. A positive test with reproduction of the patient's symptoms during passive movement between 30 and 60 degrees is suggestive of L4 to S1 nerve root involvement. A reverse straight leg test or Ely test will stretch the femoral nerve, with a positive result indicating involvement of the L2 to L4 nerve roots. In cases of radiculopathy symptoms that fail to resolve within 1 to 2 months, MRI is considered the gold standard in evaluation. For patients unable to undergo an MRI, CT scan is an acceptable alternative. In those patients where it is difficult to clinically distinguish lumbosacral radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy, EMG and NC studies can be utilized to localize a lesion with relatively high diagnostic specificity.

### Diagnostic value of history and physical examination in patients suspected of lumbosacral nerve root compression [^112zfpfy]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate patient characteristics, symptoms, and examination findings in the clinical diagnosis of lumbosacral nerve root compression causing sciatica.

Methods

The study involved 274 patients with pain radiating into the leg. All had a standardised clinical assessment and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The associations between patient characteristics, clinical findings, and lumbosacral nerve root compression on MR imaging were analysed.

Results

Nerve root compression was associated with three patient characteristics, three symptoms, and four physical examination findings (paresis, absence of tendon reflexes, a positive straight leg raising test, and increased finger-floor distance). Multivariate analysis, analysing the independent diagnostic value of the tests, showed that nerve root compression was predicted by two patient characteristics, four symptoms, and two signs (increased finger-floor distance and paresis). The straight leg raise test was not predictive. The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic was 0.80 for the history items. It increased to 0.83 when the physical examination items were added.

Conclusions

Various clinical findings were found to be associated with nerve root compression on MR imaging. While this set of findings agrees well with those commonly used in daily practice, the tests tended to have lower sensitivity and specificity than previously reported. Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that most of the diagnostic information revealed by physical examination findings had already been revealed by the history items.

### Nonoperative treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy: what factors predict treatment failure? [^1114FL6T]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prior studies of nonoperative treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy have identified potential predictors of treatment failure, defined by persistent pain, persistent disability, lack of recovery, or subsequent surgery. However, few predictors have been replicated, with the exception of higher leg pain intensity, as a predictor of subsequent surgery.

Questions/Purposes

We asked two research questions: (1) Does higher baseline leg pain intensity predict subsequent lumbar surgery? (2) Can other previously identified "candidate" predictors of nonoperative treatment failure be replicated?

Methods

Between January 2008 and March 2009, 154 participants with acute lumbosacral radicular pain were enrolled in a prospective database; 128 participants (83%) received nonoperative treatment and 26 (17%) received surgery over 2-year followup. Ninety-four nonoperative participants (73%) responded to followup questionnaires. We examined associations between previously identified "candidate" predictors and treatment failure defined as (1) subsequent surgery; (2) persistent leg pain on a visual analog scale; (3) persistent disability on the Oswestry Disability Index; or (4) participant-reported lack of recovery over 2-year followup. Confounding variables including sociodemographics, clinical factors, and imaging characteristics were evaluated using an exploratory bivariate analysis followed by a multivariate analysis.

Results

With the numbers available, higher baseline leg pain intensity was not an independent predictor of subsequent surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.22 per point of baseline leg pain; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–1.53; p = 0.08). Prior low back pain (aOR, 4.79; 95% CI, 1.01–22.7; p = 0.05) and a positive straight leg raise test (aOR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.60–11.9; p = 0.004) predicted subsequent surgery. Workers compensation claims predicted persistent leg pain (aOR, 9.04; 95% CI, 1.01–81; p = 0.05) and disability (aOR, 5.99; 95% CI, 1.09–32.7; p = 0.04). Female sex predicted persistent disability (aOR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.03–9.69; p = 0.05) and perceived lack of recovery (aOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.02–5.84; p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Higher baseline leg pain intensity was not confirmed as a predictor of subsequent surgery. However, the directionality of the association seen was consistent with prior reports, suggesting Type II error as a possible explanation; larger studies are needed to further examine this relationship. Clinicians should be aware of potential factors that may predict nonoperative treatment failure, including prior low back pain or a positive straight leg raise test as predictors of subsequent surgery, workers compensation claims as predictors of persistent leg pain and disability, and female sex as a predictor of persistent disability and lack of recovery.

### Cramp finding: can it be used as a new diagnostic and prognostic factor in lumbar disc surgery? [^117GoT8U]. European Spine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

In this prospective study, the validity and the importance of a new finding (cramp finding) in the diagnosis and outcome after lumbar disc surgery were tested. The test is performed with the person in prone position. Against a forceful knee flexion, the examiner holds the leg with one hand and applies a force to overcome the knee flexion. The finding is positive if the examined person feels a disturbing cramp in the leg or thigh. The study was performed between October 1997 and December 1999. Besides the cramp finding, the classical disc herniation examination, including mechanical and neurological findings, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging tests, and laboratory findings were checked pre- and postoperatively. The positive cramp finding in the operated group was 72% (n = 133) preoperatively and straight leg raising (SLR) test was positive in all of them. Cramp finding was positive in 70%, 52%, 34%, and 8% of patients postoperatively in the first, 3rd, 12th and 24th months, respectively. The presented finding appears to be as valuable as the SLR, and especially contralateral SLR, tests in lumbar disc surgery. Cramp finding is also important in outcome evaluation.

Femoral nerve stretch test — A retrospective case series evaluating a femoral nerve stretch test combined with straight leg raise reported that of 200 patients, 40 had surgical confirmation of a lumbar disc herniation, two patients with negative myelographic studies were found to have lateral disc herniations at surgery, and the authors concluded that in suspected L4/5 disc protrusion, induction of sciatica during the femoral nerve stretch test is diagnostic of a lesion at this level; this study provides Level III diagnostic evidence for this conclusion.

### Waddell's signs… [^112iq31P]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Waddell's signs are a group of physical signs, first described in a 1980 article in Spine, and named for the article's principal author, Professor Gordon Waddell, a Scottish Orthopedic Surgeon. Waddell's signs may indicate non-organic or psychological component to chronic low back pain. Historically they have also been used to detect malingering in patients with back pain. While testing takes less than one minute, it has been described as time-consuming and alternatives have been proposed. Use of Waddell's signs Waddell, et al. described five categories of signs:

- **Tenderness tests**: superficial and diffuse tenderness and/or nonanatomic tenderness
- **Simulation tests**: these are based on movements which produce pain, without actually causing that movement, such as axial loading and pain on simulated rotation
- **Distraction tests**: positive tests are rechecked when the patient's attention is distracted, such as a straight leg raise test.
- **Regional disturbances**: regional weakness or sensory changes which deviate from accepted neuroanatomy
- **Overreaction**: subjective signs regarding the patient's demeanor and reaction to testing Any individual sign marks its category as positive. When three or more categories were positive, the finding was considered clinically significant. However, assessing the patient on the basis of overreaction has raised concerns regarding observer bias and idiosyncrasies related to the patient's culture. Consequently, a practitioner may assess the patient on the remaining four categories, with two or more positive categories being considered clinically significant. One or two Waddell's signs can often be found even when there is not a strong non-organic component to pain. Three or more are positively correlated with high scores for depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.

Criticism Although Waddell's signs can detect a non-organic component to pain, they do not exclude an organic cause. Clinically significant Waddell scores are considered indicative only of symptom magnification or pain behavior, and have been misused in medical and medico-legal contexts. Waddell's signs are not considered a de facto indicator of deception for the purpose of financial gain. In a 2003 review, Fishbain, et al. stated that Waddell's signs do not reliably distinguish organic from psychological pain but instead tend to underestimate the amount of pain that is actually experienced. In a 2004 review, Fishbain, et al. concluded, "there was little evidence for the claims of an association between Waddell signs and secondary gain and malingering. The preponderance of the evidence points to the opposite: no association".

In 2010, a neuroanatomical basis of Waddell's signs has been proposed which argues that since the brain is organic, and even society is composed of a group of organic beings, the term "nonorganic" should be replaced by a term put forward by Chris Spanswick in 1997, "behavioral responses to physical examination". With the possible exception of cogwheel rigidity, these are best understood as neuroanatomical maladaptations to long-continued pain and, as Waddell and colleagues have stressed, do not indicate faking or malingering but rather that there are psychosocial issues that militate against successfully treating low back pain by lumbar discectomy, and which in themselves require other treatment.

Secondary Outcomes

The final model for no or minimal pain contained the following variables: a positive straight leg raise test, a low pain intensity score for the leg, and no structural changes seen on MRI at the affected level of disc herniation (Table 3). The final model for pain contained: previous pain management and structural changes seen on MRI at the affected level of disc herniation (Table 3). The explained variance (R²) was 0.06 for no or minimal pain and 0.04 for pain. The AUC was 0.59 for no or minimal pain and 0.64 for pain. After bootstrapping, the explained variance was 0.00 (no or minimal pain) and 0.01 (pain). The AUC was 0.54 (no pain) and 0.59 (pain).

The final model for no or minimal disability contained six factors: younger age, positive straight leg raise test, low pain intensity score for the leg, higher intensity leg pain than back pain, lower level of disability, and sitting activities (Table 4). The model for disability also consisted of six factors: higher age, prior back surgery, medication, high pain intensity score for the back, a higher level of disability, and no sitting activities (Table 4). The explained variance (R²) was 0.11 for no or minimal disability and 0.18 for disability. The AUC was 0.68 for no or minimal disability and 0.72 for disability. After bootstrapping, the explained variance was 0.05 (no disability) and 0.11 (disability), and AUC was 0.63 (no disability) and 0.69 (disability).

### Accuracy of clinical tests in detecting disk herniation and nerve root compression in subjects with lumbar radicular symptoms [^115begMi]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the accuracy of 3 commonly used neurodynamic tests (slump test, straight-leg raise [SLR] test, femoral neurodynamic test) and 2 clinical assessments to determine radiculopathy (radiculopathy I, 1 neurologic sign; radiculopathy II, 2 neurologic signs corresponding to 1 specific nerve root) in detecting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (extrusion, subarticular nerve root compression, and foraminal nerve root compression).

Design

Validity study.

Setting

Secondary care.

Participants

We included subjects (N = 99; mean age, 58y; 54% women) referred for epidural steroid injection because of lumbar radicular symptoms who had positive clinical and MRI findings. Positive clinical findings included the slump test (n = 67), SLR test (n = 50), femoral neurodynamic test (n = 7), radiculopathy I (n = 70), and radiculopathy II (n = 33). Positive MRI findings included extrusion (n = 27), subarticular nerve compression (n = 14), and foraminal nerve compression (n = 25).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Accuracy of clinical tests in detecting MRI findings was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristics analysis with area under the curve (AUC).

Results

The slump test had the highest sensitivity in detecting extrusion (.78) and subarticular nerve compression (1.00), but the respective specificity was low (.36 and .38). Radiculopathy I was most sensitive in detecting foraminal nerve compression (.80) but with low specificity (.34). Only 1 assessment had a concurrent high sensitivity and specificity (ie, radiculopathy II) in detecting subarticular nerve compression (.71 and .73, respectively). The AUC for all tests in detecting extrusion, subarticular nerve compression, and foraminal nerve compression showed ranges of .48 to .60, .63 to .82, and .33 to .57, respectively.

Conclusions

In general, the investigated neurodynamic tests or assessments for radiculopathy lacked diagnostic accuracy. The slump test was the most sensitive test, while radiculopathy II was the most specific test. Most interestingly, no relationship was found between any neurodynamic test and foraminal nerve compression (foraminal stenosis) as visualized on MRI.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^116D8nb2]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnosis and imaging emphasizes core test accuracy concepts and appropriate use of imaging relative to clinical assessment. With tests that have a high sensitivity, a negative test effectively rules out the disease, and with tests that have a high specificity, a positive test effectively rules in the disease; additionally, the performance of a test depends on positive and negative predictive value, which depends directly on the prevalence of disease in the tested population. One of the purposes of a history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients seen for advanced diagnostic imaging/testing or offered surgery, and the review attempted to identify those symptoms or findings which have a high likelihood ratio for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity with significant pathologic findings in asymptomatic populations, so results of any cross-sectional examination need to be closely correlated with the clinical examination. Direct visualization of intrinsic neurologic processes and neural impingement is noted as important in determining the etiology of radicular symptoms. Although the gold standard in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is surgery, when assessing the validity of subjective complaints or physical examination findings, use of cross-sectional imaging as a gold standard may be considered an acceptable substitute, though the validity of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned as findings at surgery can be subjective. Additional sufficiently-powered observational studies of history/physical examination findings and diagnostic tests are needed to determine their value in influencing treatment assignment and outcome in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

Lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation — diagnostic accuracy of bedside examination is limited and variable. Physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy related to disc herniation in patients with low back pain often provides inaccurate and incomplete information. In surgical populations with a high prevalence of disc herniation (58% to 98%), the straight leg raise (SLR) shows high sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.95) but widely varying specificity (0.10 to 1.00, pooled estimate 0.28, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.40). The crossed SLR demonstrates high specificity of 0.90 with low sensitivity (0.28). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a reference standard, sensory testing demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.61 and a specificity of 0.63; motor test sensitivity ranges from 0.13 to 0.61. Reflex testing shows specificity ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 with sensitivity ranging from 0.14 to 0.67, and the SLR records a mean sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.78.

### Incremental ability of needle electromyography to detect radiculopathy in patients with radiating low back pain using different diagnostic criteria [^112odWx6]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incremental ability of different needle electromyography diagnostic criteria to detect lumbar radiculopathy.

Design

Blinded cross-sectional study.

Setting

University hospital.

Participants

Subjects aged 55 to 80 years with radiating low back pain (n = 48; mean age ± SD, 67.9 ± 7.3y) and who were asymptomatic (n = 30; mean age ± SD, 65.4 ± 8y).

Interventions

Electrodiagnostic evaluation by a blinded electromyographer. A monopolar needle was used to evaluate 5 leg muscles and the lumbar paraspinal muscles.

Main Outcome Measures

Presence or absence of radiculopathy using different electrodiagnostic criteria.

Results

When only positive sharp waves or fibrillations were considered, and at least 2 muscles innervated by the same root level and different peripheral nerves were counted as abnormal, 27.1% (13/48) of participants had positive results for radiculopathy. When at least 30% motor unit action potential changes in the limb muscles were also considered, participants with positive results increased to 45.8% (22/48), which was significant when compared with the first criterion (P = 0.002). When the mini-paraspinal mapping (MiniPM) test as well as at least a 30% motor unit cutoff was used, participants with positive results increased to 50% (24/48), which was significant when compared with the first criterion (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

In addition to the presence of positive sharp waves or fibrillations, considering greater than or equal to 30% motor unit action unit potential changes as well as the MiniPM score maintains good specificity and improves the ability of the needle electromyography study to detect lumbar radiculopathy in subjects with radiating low back pain.

### 2014 young investigator award winner: in vivo magnetic resonance imaging measurement of spinal cord displacement in the thoracolumbar region of asymptomatic subjects: part 1: straight leg raise test [^112kEwpJ]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Controlled radiological study.

Objective

To investigate noninvasively in vivo spinal cord displacement in the vertebral canal during the passive straight leg raise (SLR) in asymptomatic subjects. The basic assumption is that the cord follows L5 and S1 nerve roots displacement by similar magnitude and direction (principle of linear dependence).

Summary Of Background Data

It is generally accepted that the SLR produces some caudal movement mainly of L5 and S1 nerve roots, but the magnitude of this displacement is still a matter of debate.

Methods

Sixteen asymptomatic volunteers were scanned with 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens Avanto, Erlangen, Germany) using T2-weighted turbo spin-echo fat-saturation sequence. The displacement of the medullar cone relative to the vertebral endplate of the adjacent vertebra during the passive SLR was quantified and compared with the position of the conus in the neutral (anatomic) position. Each movement was performed twice for evaluation of reproducibility. The measurements were repeated by 2 observers. Four practitioners performed the maneuvers in a random sequence to avoid series effects.

Results

Compared with the neutral (anatomic) position, the medullar cone displaced caudally in the spinal canal by 2.31 ± 1.2 mm with right (P ≤ 0.001) and 2.35 ± 1.2 mm with left SLR (P ≤ 0.001). Spearman correlations proved higher than 0.99 for intra and interobserver reliability, as well as results reproducibility testing for each maneuver.

Conclusion

The data show that the spinal cord in the thoracolumbar region slides distally in response to the clinically applied SLR test. The high correlation values in this study show that these movements are consistent and reproducible. Because of the neural continuum, the authors speculate that this movement might be directly proportional to the sliding of the L5 and S1 neural roots. This study offers baseline measurements on which further studies in diagnosis of lumbar disc protrusion and radiculopathy may be developed.

### Detection of lumbosacral nerve root compression with a novel composite nerve conduction measurement [^112gAcTu]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

Multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to develop a composite nerve conduction measurement that detects lumbosacral (L5, S1, or both) nerve root compression.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a composite nerve conduction measurement for detection of lumbosacral nerve root compression.

Summary Of Background Data

Nerve root involvement is characterized by clinical abnormalities and confirmed by radiologic and electrodiagnostic studies. Imaging studies visualize structural abnormalities; however, they are associated with high false-positive rates. Electrodiagnostic methods assess the physiologic integrity of the nerve roots. One form of electrodiagnostic testing, nerve conduction studies, is widely used for evaluation of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular complaints. Although similar clinical value is expected for the evaluation of nerve root compromise, prior applications of nerve conduction studies have yielded widely varying results.

Methods

Two groups of subjects were compared. The L5-S1 compression group was composed of 25 patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbosacral (L5, S1, or both) nerve root compression and symptoms in the appropriate segmental distribution. The majority of subjects (22) had at least one of the following findings on physical examination: positive straight-leg raise test, diminished ankle reflexes, sensory loss, or weakness. The control group consisted of 35 asymptomatic individuals with no history of radiculopathy or potentially confounding neuropathology. The posterior tibial and deep peroneal nerves were evaluated bilaterally in all study subjects using standard nerve conduction procedures, which consisted of the measurement of distal motor latencies and F-wave latencies that assess nerve root pathophysiology. A composite nerve conduction measurement was determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The efficacy of the composite measurement was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and by the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Five F-wave latency parameters (peroneal mean F-wave latency, odds ratio = 0.42; peroneal seventh F-wave latency decile, odds ratio = 2.71; tibial mean F-wave latency, odds ratio = 8.90; tibial first F-wave latency decile, odds ratio = 0.47; tibial maximum F-wave latency, odds ratio = 0.44) were found to be predictive of nerve root compression. A composite nerve conduction measurement, NC composite, constructed from these five parameters (NC composite = exp(phi)/(1 + exp(phi)), phi = -31.2 + 1.0 * Per7 Decile - 0.88 * PerMean + 2.2 * TibMean - 0.88 * Tib1 Decile - 0.83 * TibMax) yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. At a threshold of 0.20, NC composite had a diagnostic specificity of 84.3% and a sensitivity of 83.3%.

Conclusion

This preliminary study suggests that a novel composite nerve conduction measurement, based on F-wave latency parameters, may be highly effective at detecting magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbosacral nerve root compression. Because these measurements provide objective evidence of functional nerve root compromise and are noninvasive, they may be of diagnostic value to clinicians evaluating patients presenting with low back and leg pain.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^112NCmCF]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Electrodiagnostic evaluations are commonly requested for patients with suspected radiculopathy. Understanding lower extremity musculoskeletal conditions is essential for electrodiagnostic medicine specialists, as musculoskeletal disorders often mimic or coexist with radiculopathy. This review delineates radicular pain from other types originating from the lumbosacral spine and describes musculoskeletal conditions frequently mimicking radiculopathy, such as those that cause radiating pain and sensorimotor dysfunction. In clinical evaluation, a history of pain radiating along a specific dermatomal territory with associated sensory disturbance suggests radiculopathy. Physical examination findings consistent with radiculopathy include myotomal weakness, depressed or absent muscle stretch reflexes, focal atrophy along a discrete nerve root territory, and potentially positive dural tension maneuvers like the straight leg raise. However, electrodiagnostic medicine specialists must be knowledgeable of musculoskeletal mimics, which may manifest as incomplete radiation within or beyond a dermatomal territory, non-radiating pain, tenderness, and give-way weakness, in the context of a normal neurological examination. A systematic approach to musculoskeletal examination is vital, and this review focuses on high-yield physical examination maneuvers and diagnostic investigations to differentiate between musculoskeletal conditions and radiculopathy. This approach ensures accurate diagnoses, promotes resource stewardship, enhances patient satisfaction, and optimizes care delivery. Musculoskeletal conditions resembling L1 to S4 radiculopathy are reviewed, emphasizing their distinctive features in history, physical examination, and diagnostic investigation. Among the more than 30 musculoskeletal disorders reviewed are hip and knee osteoarthritis, lumbar facet syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and plantar fasciitis.

### Physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation in patients with low-back pain [^1136ySRX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Low-back pain with leg pain (sciatica) may be caused by a herniated intervertebral disc exerting pressure on the nerve root. Most patients will respond to conservative treatment, but in carefully selected patients, surgical discectomy may provide faster relief of symptoms. Primary care clinicians use patient history and physical examination to evaluate the likelihood of disc herniation and select patients for further imaging and possible surgery.

Objectives

(1) To assess the performance of tests performed during physical examination (alone or in combination) to identify radiculopathy due to lower lumbar disc herniation in patients with low-back pain and sciatica;(2) To assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on diagnostic performance.

Search Strategy

We searched electronic databases for primary studies: PubMed (includes MEDLINE), EMBASE, and CINAHL, and (systematic) reviews: PubMed and Medion (all from earliest until 30 April 2008), and checked references of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We considered studies if they compared the results of tests performed during physical examination on patients with back pain with those of diagnostic imaging (MRI, CT, myelography) or findings at surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed the quality of each publication with the QUADAS tool, and extracted details on patient and study design characteristics, index tests and reference standard, and the diagnostic two-by-two table. We presented information on sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all aspects of physical examination. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were computed for subsets of studies showing sufficient clinical and statistical homogeneity.

Main Results

We included 16 cohort studies (median N = 126, range 71 to 2504) and three case control studies (38 to100 cases). Only one study was carried out in a primary care population. When used in isolation, diagnostic performance of most physical tests (scoliosis, paresis or muscle weakness, muscle wasting, impaired reflexes, sensory deficits) was poor. Some tests (forward flexion, hyper-extension test, and slump test) performed slightly better, but the number of studies was small. In the one primary care study, most tests showed higher specificity and lower sensitivity compared to other settings. Most studies assessed the Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test. In surgical populations, characterized by a high prevalence of disc herniation (58% to 98%), the SLR showed high sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.95) with widely varying specificity (0.10 to 1.00, pooled estimate 0.28, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.40). Results of studies using imaging showed more heterogeneity and poorer sensitivity. The crossed SLR showed high specificity (pooled estimate 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.94) with consistently low sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.35). Combining positive test results increased the specificity of physical tests, but few studies presented data on test combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

When used in isolation, current evidence indicates poor diagnostic performance of most physical tests used to identify lumbar disc herniation. However, most findings arise from surgical populations and may not apply to primary care or non-selected populations. Better performance may be obtained when tests are combined.

4.5.1 Piriformis syndrome

Piriformis syndrome, sometimes termed deep gluteal syndrome, refers to buttock and/or leg pain caused by impingement of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle where the muscle crosses the sciatic notch, coinciding with where the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis. This diagnosis is somewhat controversial and its prevalence is debated. In one prospective study, more than 6% of patients presenting with "sciatica" and low back or buttock pain had piriformis syndrome. In studies examining patients with piriformis syndrome, 35%–100% of patients with this condition had radiation of symptoms to the leg, mimicking radiculopathy. Importantly, the supine straight leg raise test, frequently used in radiculopathy, is often positive in persons with piriformis syndrome.

Patients with piriformis syndrome report buttock and/or radicular pain that is often worse with sitting and with increased tension on the piriformis muscle. Reproduction of buttock and/or leg symptoms using physical exam maneuvers that increase tension on the piriformis muscle, such as passive hip internal rotation and adduction with the hip flexed (the FAIR test) and resisted hip abduction with the hip flexed, support the diagnosis. For instance, the active piriformis test, in which patients lie on the contralateral side and tension the piriformis muscle by abducting and externally rotating their hip while the examiner resists these movements has a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.80. In the passive (seated) piriformis test, tension on the piriformis muscle is generated by having the patient sit with the hip flexed to 90 degrees with the knee in extension, and having the examiner move the hip in adduction and internal rotation while palpating the sciatic notch; this test has a sensitivity of 0.53 and a specificity of 0.90 for piriformis syndrome. The combination of these two tests improves the sensitivity to 0.91 and specificity to 0.80. Tenderness to palpation and/or reproduction of symptoms on palpation of the sciatic notch (Figure 2) is also suggestive of piriformis syndrome.

### Identifying lumbosacral plexus nerve root abnormalities in patients with sciatica using 3T readout-segmented echo-planar diffusion weighted MR neurography [^112fkuyj]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lumbar radiculopathy (or sciatica), defined as pain with possible motor and sensory disturbances in a lumbar nerve-root distribution, is a common symptom with various potential etiologies. A patient's clinical history and physical examination (e.g. straight-leg-raise test) are only moderately accurate in establishing the diagnosis. We have found that the DWI-RESOLVE sequence generated high-quality images of the lumbosacral plexus allowing clear visualization and localization of abnormalities that correlated to patient symptoms. It was determined that affected nerves tend to enlarge and display higher signal intensity relative to normal nerves, which is in-line with previous studies involving the application of EPI DWI at 1.5T and 3T.

Currently, EMG/NCV claims to be the most specific technique for evaluating lumbosacral nerves and is regarded as the reference standard in existing literature. Overall, only 36.3% (40/110) of patients with radicular-type symptoms had positive findings on DWI-RESOLVE images and this percentage reasonably matches the EMG/NCV findings (41.2%). This is not unexpected given the difficulty in distinguishing true neural origin radicular symptoms from other etiologies. The inter-observer agreement was excellent for DWI-RESOLVE, indicating that the images reliably demonstrated the abnormality.

### Pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the lumbar dorsal root ganglion in patients with chronic lumbar radicular pain: a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study [^111f8QWq]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This study was approved by the research ethics board at St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton and is registered at clinicaltrials.gov with the unique identifier NCT01117870. All involved patients gave their written, fully informed consent for the study. This was a single-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded (patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors) RCT. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 years or older; a history of CLR pain of at least 4 months' duration; an average pain score of ≥ 5 on a VAS of 0–10; and failure of conservative therapy (eg, physiotherapy, medication trial). The patients were further screened for clinical features of lumbosacral radicular pain. This included segmental pain of a radicular nature originating from the lumbar or sacral segments and radiating below the knee joint, and with a shooting or lancinating quality corresponding to a dermatome suggestive of the involved nerve root. All included patients also had to demonstrate computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging findings of pathology concordant with the side and level of their clinical features. We did not specify any diagnostic test for inclusion because all of these tests, including the well-known straight leg raising test, have low diagnostic value. Exclusion criteria included patient refusal to participate, any contraindication to neuraxial injections, a history of predominant back pain over leg pain, significant anatomic deformity (either congenital or acquired) making it difficult to access the foramen as evidenced by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, severe psychiatric illness, presence of cancer accounting for back pain, inability to communicate in English, allergy to local anesthetics or contrast medium, and a history of motor findings in the affected leg.

4.6.1 Hamstring strains and proximal hamstring tendinopathy

The hamstrings consist of three muscles, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris, that collectively flex the knee and extend the hip. These muscles are vulnerable to both sudden injury or insidious, degenerative tendinopathy, particularly proximally at the ischial tuberosity. In hamstring conditions of acute and/or insidious onset, pain can radiate, often to the popliteal fossa, and patients may have knee flexion weakness, both mimicking radiculopathy. Acute hamstring injuries tend to arise from eccentric loading, such as sprinting to first base in baseball, or movements of extreme hip flexion and knee extension, like kicking. Patients who present with hamstring strains and/or acute tears typically report sudden onset of posterior thigh pain; they may have bruising and/or a palpable defect within the muscle belly. Patients who develop proximal hamstring tendinopathy frequently present with insidious onset of buttock and posterior thigh pain, which may radiate to the popliteal fossa. Pain may localize to and be reproducible on palpation of the proximal hamstring attachment at the ischial tuberosity but these patients usually do not have a palpable defect in the muscle belly. Patients with hamstring muscle or tendon pathology may have weakness of knee flexion, walk with a stiff‐knee gait to avoid terminal knee extension and eccentric hamstring activation, and have pain reproduced with hamstring stretch. Pain with resisted knee flexion and pain with rapid passive knee extension from a flexed position are common features on provocative testing. Positive findings on active resisted knee flexion with the knee at 30 and 90 degrees of flexion have a specificity of 0.97 and a positive likelihood ratio of 26.9 in one study of patients without "sciatica". Diagnosis can be confirmed with US and/or MRI if needed to support clinical decision‐making.

4.6.4 Sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the largest axial joint and consists of a synovial joint and complex ligamentous structures. SIJ dysfunction is a common cause of low back, buttock, and leg pain, with a prevalence of 15%–30% in persons presenting with low back pain. Although the sacroiliac joint is located in the posterior pelvis, pain arising from the joint can manifest as pain in the lumbar spine, buttock, leg distal to the knee, and into the foot. The pain tends to worsen with transitions, such as from sitting to standing. Numerous provocative tests have been described. Pain to palpation of the SIJ (just inferior and medial to the posterior superior iliac spine) and absence of pain above L5 support the diagnosis. Additional evidence‐based tests include Gaenslen's test, SIJ distraction test, thigh thrust test, SIJ compression test, and the FABER test, although none of these tests have high reliability when used alone. Due to the challenging nature of the diagnosis, some experts advocate that the presence of three positive tests should be considered indicative of SIJ dysfunction (sensitivity 0.94, specificity 0.78). Injection into the SIJ can also provide diagnostic and/or therapeutic benefit and confirm the diagnosis.

Although inflammatory arthritides and spondyloarthropathies may present with SIJ pain, a comprehensive review of relevant history and physical examination findings is beyond the scope of this review. However, clinicians should strongly consider the possibility in patients with skin or nail manifestations of psoriasis, a personal history of uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, a family history of spondyloarthropathy, or clinical dactylitis.

Subjects with acute/subacute low back pain with (n = 40) and without (n = 35) radicular pain.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

We examined the relationship between RMDQ (reference variable) and SLR test and fingertip-to-floor test. The sample was stratified by presence/absence of radicular pain (categorized by the dichotomous slump test).

Results

In the entire sample, fair correlations were found between both physical impairment tests (ie, SLR test and flexion ROM) and self-reported disability (.27 < r > .44). After stratification by sex, the correlation between RMDQ and flexion ROM and between RMDQ and nonside-specific SLR test increased in women but decreased in men. In those with radicular pain, good correlations were found between RMDQ and flexion ROM (r = .68 for men and r = .70 for women), and moderate correlation was found between the RMDQ and SLR tests of the affected side in women (r = .60), but only fair correlation was found between the RMDQ and SLR tests of the affected side in men (r = .28).

Conclusions

After stratification by sex and presence/absence of radicular pain, the present study supports a good validity of the fingertip-to-floor test for both men and women with radicular pain. The SLR test, however, was of less value as an indicator of self-reported disability after stratification, especially for men.

Features of somatic and radicular pain — somatic or referred pain versus radicular pain are contrasted across causes, symptoms, mechanical modification, radiation, and signs. Segment causes for somatic or referred pain include posterior elements such as "Posterior segment or element", "Facet joint pain", "Sacroiliac joint pain", "Myofascial syndrome", and "Internal disc disruption", whereas radicular pain lists "Anterior segment", "Disc herniation", "Annular tear, discogenic pain", and "Spinal stenosis". Symptoms differ with somatic described as "Dull, aching, deep" and "Like an expanding pressure", while radicular is "Sharp, shooting, superficial, lancinating" and "Like an electric shock". Somatic pain is "Poorly localized", "Covers a wide area", with "Back worse than leg", "No paresthesia", and "No radicular or shooting pain", whereas radicular pain is "Well localized", "Leg worse than back", has "Paresthesia present", is "Well defined", with "Radicular distribution". Mechanical modification shows somatic "Worse with extension" and "Better with flexion" with "No radicular pattern", while radicular is "Worse with flexion" and "Better with extension" with "Radicular pattern". Radiation for somatic is "Low back to hip, thigh, groin", with "Radiation below knee unusual" and "Quasi segmental", while radicular "Follows nerve distribution", with "Radiation below knee common" and "Radicular pattern". Signs differ in that sensory alteration is "Uncommon" for somatic and "Probable" for radicular; motor changes show somatic "Only subjective weakness" and "Atrophy rare" versus radicular "Objective weakness" and "Atrophy possibly present"; reflex changes are "None" for somatic and "Commonly described, but seen only occasionally" for radicular; straight leg raises show somatic "Only low back pain" versus radicular "Reproduction of leg pain", and somatic presents "No root tension signs" versus radicular "Positive root tension signs".

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114iDYFe]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Physical examination localization — Clinical findings were localized according to the distribution of the lumbosacral roots in 93% of cases; the Achilles reflex was of value in diagnosing L5-S1 disc ruptures when associated with pain projection and first sacral sensory deficit, the patellar reflex had no value in diagnosing low lumbar lesions, and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) weakness was due to L4–5 rupture in 70% of cases; this study provides Level I diagnostic evidence that physical examination, including positive straight leg raise, sensory testing and myotomal weakness, can provide specific clues to the level of disc herniation.

### Positive straight-leg raising in lumbar radiculopathy: is documentation affected by insurance coverage? [^117PCaBB]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether differences exist in documentation of straight-leg raising (SLR), based on insurance coverage.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Managed care organization (MCO).

Participants

Two hundred people with a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy or herniated disk were referred to an MCO for authorization of further treatment. Half were self-directed under a personal injury program (PIP) after automobile collisions, and half were covered under a managed care workmen's compensation (WC) program.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Documentation of an SLR test, strength, sensation, and/or reflexes were eligible for the study. The results of SLR were coded as 0, 1, or 2, for absent, positive unilateral, and positive bilateral, respectively. Additional information included subject age, sex, date of injury, provider type, and presence of attorney representation

Results

A positive (unilateral, bilateral) SLR in women was 7.4 times more likely if they were covered by PIP than by WC (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–38.7; p = 0.018). For men, a positive SLR was 23.5 times more likely if they were covered by a PIP (95% CI, 2.9–189.9; p = 0.003). The odds of bilateral SLR (radicular pain on both sides) were even more strongly associated with type of reimbursement. For women, bilateral SLR was 105.1 times more likely if they were covered by a PIP than by WC (95% CI, 11.1–992.6; P < .001). For men, bilateral SLR was 38.9 times more likely if covered by a PIP (95% CI, 11.3–133.6; P < .001).

Conclusions

Reasons for reporting higher rates of positive SLR in the PIP group include an added incentive to treat, poor knowledge of proper interpretation of the SLR test, and/or an increased exaggeration of symptoms.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^117NbZ6x]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We used the search from that identified from the search of our review on the effectiveness of conservative interventions in CR. The search strategy followed the recommendation by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. Electronic searches included Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from 1966 up to October 2010. Manual searches of review bibliographies and reference lists of primary studies were undertaken to obtain possible studies not captured by the electronic searches. Two librarians together with a review author (ET) performed the electronic search (" Appendix "). Studies were included that evaluated a conservative intervention in a randomised clinical trial (RCT) in patients with CR. Different from our previous review, this time the type of outcome measures or the type of comparison interventions used were not taken as an exclusion criterion.

Data extraction

From each included study, the diagnostic criteria used to define the diagnosis of CR (not criteria related to the intervention) and the definitions for CR were extracted.

Three reviewer authors (ET, RO, AdB) performed the data extraction independently, using a pre-determined data extraction form (available from the authors).

Analysis

The criteria for patient selection were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated on uniformity. We divided selection criteria into clinical symptoms, clinical testing, diagnostic imaging, and exclusion criteria. Clinical symptoms were subdivided into pain and sensory symptoms. Clinical tests were subdivided into pain provocation tests, changes in range of motion, and neurological examination, e.g. motor disturbances and reflex changes. We aimed to identify either corresponding or contradictory diagnostic tests and features of CR. Items were considered to correspond if they described the same test, cluster of tests, or feature in labelling "cervical radiculopathy" (e.g. "Spurling's compression test" or "combined lateral flexion and extension") provoking neck and/or arm pain. Our conclusion of consensus between criteria or definitions across the studies was (arbitrary) set at 75%: if more than 75% of studies set a certain criterion. Criteria were considered to be contradictory when the item was a reason for inclusion in one article and a reason for exclusion in another.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^115mhNnw]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized trial unequivocally showed that early surgery led to significantly faster recovery compared to prolonged conservative care but failed to present any interaction with (effect modification by) classical neurological signs and MRI findings. Remarkably only the anamnestic finding "sciatica provoked by sitting" showed interaction with timing of surgery, and thus influenced rate of recovery. These results were markedly consistent in stratified analyses of all primary outcomes over the first year and presented a larger effect size in favour of early surgery in those patients who were unable to sit as a result of sciatic neuralgia.

The finding that classic physical signs and high preference of the patient for surgery did not affect the results of treatment strategies was surprising and not expected. Currently most physicians and physiotherapists refer patients for surgery under the near mandatory condition that the straight leg raise test provokes sciatica. The design of this trial made it possible to include enough patients with a negative straight leg raising test. These, however, form a minority which may be due to selection bias. Therefore these results must have to be interpreted very carefully, which also holds true for the findings regarding patient preferences. Earlier prognostic studies suggested a realistic relationship between patient's and doctor's preferences and expectations on the one hand and outcome on the other. These expectations are still likely to play a major role since the patients in this randomized trial were all eager to undergo surgery; in fact this was their main motive to visit the outpatient clinic of the participating hospitals. Only a minority of patients did not have a clear preference for surgery and no patient had a preference for the conservative treatment strategy. Therefore the lack of influence of patient preferences on treatment strategies is not directly applicable to general practice.

7.1 Lumbar spine — history and physical examination emphasize neurological, motor, sensory, and reflex assessment with provocative maneuvers including straight leg raising test, crossed straight leg raising test, bowstring sign, and slump test. Subjective symptoms of numbness are considered reasonably sensitive (0.76), but not specific (0.33) as a sign of radiculopathy. The sensory examination should cover the bilateral lower extremities, and a simple approach involves testing for sensation for 3 dermatomes in the lower extremity (L4, L5, and S1). The sensitivity and specificity of the sensory examination in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation has been described to range from 16% to 66% for sensitivity, and 51% to 86% for the specificity.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111fzxKn]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

GTPS can be difficult to distinguish from radiculopathies for several reasons. First, the distribution of pain may approximate L3, L4, or L5 radiculopathies due to the common complaint of pain radiating along the lateral thigh in a distal fashion. Second, patients with GTPS often have history and physical examination findings also found in radiculopathy, such as pain in the thigh (58%), pain below the knee (67%), and ipsilateral lower extremity weakness (62%). Finally, patients with radiculopathy are at an increased risk of GTPS due to biomechanical alterations, such as Trendelenberg gait, and patients with painful lower extremity conditions are at increased risk of lumbosacral radiculopathy due to imbalances in the spine. Biomechanical alterations associated with gluteus medius weakness can lead to GTPS, so clinicians should strongly consider the possibility that GTPS may occur concurrently with L5/S1 radiculopathy.

GTPS is characterized by pain at the lateral hip which may radiate down the lateral thigh, point tenderness at the greater trochanter (Figure 2) with palpation or lying on the affected side, pain with resisted hip abduction in side‐lying, and lateral hip pain at end‐range motion for hip Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation (i.e. the FABER test, sometimes termed Patrick's test). Ober's test, in which patients lie in lateral decubitus with the affected side up while the examiner passively abducts and extends the hip, and lowers the leg slowly to its passive resting position, is frequently used in the evaluation of patients with suspected GTPS. However, studies cast doubt on the utility of Ober's test and the modified Ober's test for this diagnosis. Pain may also occur with activity, prolonged standing, and transitions from sitting to standing. The onset of pain may be insidious, secondary to biomechanical alterations such as Trendelenberg gait or post‐hip arthroplasty, or may be traumatic, such as after a fall.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^112sqtag]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Diagnostic Characteristics

The fundamental components of the patient physical examination were derived from the foundational article by Bogdukand consolidated into a suite of clinical features characteristic of lumbar discogenic pain. These features, when considered altogether, enhance the diagnostic accuracy for this condition. During the initial patient encounter, a thorough clinical assessment should be conducted to determine the likelihood and duration of possible discogenic pain symptoms (Figure 1, Box 1).

To identify lumbar discogenic pain, the physical evaluation should consider five components. First, the prominent pain location should be axial midline back pain. Clinical manifestation of non-discogenic low back pain due to painful facet or sacroiliac joints is not commonly midline. The patient may also experience referred leg pain but it should be described as non-radicular/non-sciatic pain in a sclerotomal distribution. Patient-reported low back pain severity should be ≥ 4 at the time of physical examination (0 to 10 scale).

Second, the pain is primarily exacerbated with forward flexion. Lumbar flexion involves axial loading which increases annular strain and correlates with pain emanating from degenerated lumbar intervertebral discs. Since the fulcrum of the anterior column is located posteriorly, a small percentage of patients may have pain with extension.

Third, the patient should exhibit significant functional limitation in sitting duration and tolerance. The pain may become worse when patients sit without support, especially when sitting forward. A sitting intolerance limit of 30 minutes is considered the standard threshold for discogenic pain.

Fourth, the pain should be provoked and reproduced with sustained passive hip flexion. This maneuver is undertaken with the patient in the supine, straight-leg position. Both legs are elevated simultaneously to approximately 45 degrees and then both are allowed to come down slowly. As with forward flexion, biphasic straightening from flexion produces strain across the disc with pain provocation indicating that both or either leg activates back pain. This clinical assessment should not be confused with the straight leg raising test (Laseque's sign) which is a neurodynamic examination to evaluate nerve root irritation or compression associated with radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation.

### Negative neurodynamic tests Do not exclude neural dysfunction in patients with entrapment neuropathies [^115sYns1]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Neurodynamic tests are frequently used in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected entrapment neuropathies. These tests are designed to elongate the nerve bed, therefore increasing strain on neural structures. Commonly used tests include the straight leg raise or slump test for patients with radiating back or leg painor upper limb neurodynamic tests (ULNTs) for patients with radiating neck or arm pain. The clinometric properties of these tests are however weak, which is reflected in a subgroup of patients with normative neurodynamic tests despite a clear injury to their peripheral nervous system. For instance, some patients with lumbar radiculopathy have an inconspicuous straight leg raise, and a substantial proportion of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have negative ULNTs despite confirmed nerve involvement. The question arises why this discrepancy exists and whether there might be a physiological explanation for the presence of negative neurodynamic tests despite neural tissue compromise.

Whereas a potential compromise in neural function (loss of function) is commonly tested with neurologic integrity tests (sensation, muscle strength, and reflexes), neurodynamic tests have been proposed to identify alterations of mechanosensitivity in neural tissue, thus testing gain of function. It is therefore commonly accepted that minor nerve injuries can present with positive neurodynamic tests, even if neurologic integrity tests are normative. Given that neurodynamic tests are thought to identify gain of function (ie, heightened mechanosensitivity), we hypothesize that patients with positive neurodynamic tests are characterized by gain of function, whereas loss of function may prevail in those with negative neurodynamic tests.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a well-established method that allows detailed evaluation of somatosensory phenotypes, including gain and loss of function within small and large fiber domains. Whereas some studies have used QST in patient populations with positive neurodynamic tests (eg, radiculopathy, nonspecific neck or arm pain,), to our knowledge, no study has investigated whether the somatosensory phenotypes differ between patients with positive and negative neurodynamic tests. We therefore used QST to examine potential differences in somatosensory phenotypes of patients with electrodiagnostically proven CTS, who have either positive or negative neurodynamic tests, and compare their phenotypes with people without CTS.

### Diagnostic value of history, physical examination and needle electromyography in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy [^116GonP8]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

To examine the diagnostic value of history, physical examination and needle EMG in predicting nerve root compression on MRI in patients with clinical suspicion of lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LSRS). Subjects comprised 202 consecutive patients from January 2006 to March 2007 with suspicion of LSRS referred by general practitioners. Clinical evaluation consisted of history, physical examination, EMG and MRI. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the diagnostic value of each test item compared to radiological nerve root compression. 95 patients (47%) had radiological nerve root compression. Significant predictors of radiological nerve root compression were dermatomal radiation [odds ratio (OR) 2.1], more pain on coughing, sneezing or straining (OR 2.4), positive straight leg raising (OR 3.0) and ongoing denervation on EMG (OR 4.5). 15 patients (7%) had ongoing denervation on EMG without radiological nerve root compression. In clinical practice, dermatomal radiation, more pain on coughing, sneezing or straining, positive straight leg raising and ongoing denervation on EMG may be used to predict nerve root compression on MRI. EMG may also be of additional value in patient with clinical suspicion of lumbosacral radicular syndrome without nerve root involvement on MRI.

### Sciatica… [^116Tbn3f]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Sciatica is pain going down the leg from the lower back. This pain may extend down the back, outside, or front of the leg. Onset is often sudden following activities such as heavy lifting, though gradual onset may also occur. The pain is often described as shooting. Typically, symptoms occur on only one side of the body; certain causes, however, may result in pain on both sides. Lower back pain is sometimes present. Weakness or numbness may occur in various parts of the affected leg and foot. About 90% of sciatica is due to a spinal disc herniation pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and pregnancy are other possible causes of sciatica. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed.

However, imaging may be obtained if bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern for tumor or infection. Conditions that can present similarly are diseases of the hip and infections such as early shingles. Definition The term "sciatica" usually describes a symptom — pain along the sciatic nerve pathway — rather than a specific condition, illness, or disease. Some use it to mean any pain starting in the lower back and going down the leg. The pain is characteristically described as shooting or shock-like, quickly traveling along the course of the affected nerves. Others use the term as a diagnosis for nerve dysfunction caused by compression of one or more lumbar or sacral nerve roots from a spinal disc herniation. Pain typically occurs in the distribution of a dermatome and goes below the knee to the foot.

It may be associated with neurological dysfunction, such as weakness and numbness. Piriformis syndrome Piriformis syndrome is a condition that, depending on the analysis, varies from a "very rare" cause to contributing up to 8% of low back or buttock pain. In 17% of people, the sciatic nerve runs through the piriformis muscle rather than beneath it. When the piriformis shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it is posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve. Other Pain that does not improve when lying down suggests a nonmechanical cause, such as cancer, inflammation, or infection. Sciatica can be caused by tumors impinging on the spinal cord or the nerve roots. Severe back pain extending to the hips and feet, loss of bladder or bowel control, or muscle weakness may result from spinal tumors or cauda equina syndrome. Trauma to the spine, such as from a car accident or hard fall onto the heel or buttocks, may also lead to sciatica.

A relationship has been proposed with a latent Cutibacterium acnes infection in the intervertebral discs, but the role it plays is not yet clear. As an individual ages, the anulus fibrosus weakens and becomes less rigid, making it at greater risk for tear. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of spinal tissue can then spread to adjacent facet joints and cause facet syndrome, which is characterized by lower back pain and referred pain in the posterior thigh. Other causes of sciatica secondary to spinal nerve entrapment include the roughening, enlarging, or misalignment of vertebrae, or disc degeneration that reduces the diameter of the lateral foramen through which nerve roots exit the spine.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1125kYvd]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Electrodiagnostic evaluations are commonly requested for patients with suspected radiculopathy. Understanding lower extremity musculoskeletal conditions is essential for electrodiagnostic medicine specialists, as musculoskeletal disorders often mimic or coexist with radiculopathy. This review delineates radicular pain from other types originating from the lumbosacral spine and describes musculoskeletal conditions frequently mimicking radiculopathy, such as those that cause radiating pain and sensorimotor dysfunction. In clinical evaluation, a history of pain radiating along a specific dermatomal territory with associated sensory disturbance suggests radiculopathy. Physical examination findings consistent with radiculopathy include myotomal weakness, depressed or absent muscle stretch reflexes, focal atrophy along a discrete nerve root territory, and potentially positive dural tension maneuvers like the straight leg raise. However, electrodiagnostic medicine specialists must be knowledgeable of musculoskeletal mimics, which may manifest as incomplete radiation within or beyond a dermatomal territory, non‐radiating pain, tenderness, and give‐way weakness, in the context of a normal neurological examination. A systematic approach to musculoskeletal examination is vital, and this review focuses on high‐yield physical examination maneuvers and diagnostic investigations to differentiate between musculoskeletal conditions and radiculopathy. This approach ensures accurate diagnoses, promotes resource stewardship, enhances patient satisfaction, and optimizes care delivery. Musculoskeletal conditions resembling L1 to S4 radiculopathy are reviewed, emphasizing their distinctive features in history, physical examination, and diagnostic investigation. Among the more than 30 musculoskeletal disorders reviewed are hip and knee osteoarthritis, lumbar facet syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and plantar fasciitis.

### Ribosomal PCR assay of excised intervertebral discs from patients undergoing single-level primary lumbar microdiscectomy [^112WhHhv]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the presence of infectious microorganisms in the herniated discs of immunocompetent patients, using methodology that we hoped would be of higher sensitivity and specificity than has been reported in the past. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant rate of positive cultures for low virulent organisms in excised HNP samples (range 19–53%). These studies have served as the theoretical basis for a pilot trial, and then, a well done prospective randomized trial that demonstrated that systemic treatment with antibiotics may yield lasting improvements in a subset of patients with axial back pain. Whether the reported positive cultures in discectomy specimens represent true positives is as yet not proven, and critically important if underlying the basis of therapeutic approaches for chronic low back pain.

Methods

This consecutive case series from a single academic center included 44 patients with radiculopathy and MRI findings of lumbar HNP. Patients elected for lumbar microdiscectomy after failure of conservative management. All patients received primary surgery at a single spinal level in the absence of immune compromise. Excised disc material was analyzed with a real-time PCR assay targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene followed by amplicon sequencing. No concurrent cultures were performed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: sensory or motor symptoms in a single lumbar nerve distribution; positive physical examination findings including positive straight leg raise test, distributional weakness, and/or a diminished deep tendon reflexes; and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine positive for HNP in a distribution correlating with the radicular complaint.

Results

The PCR assay for the 16S rRNA sequence was negative in all 44 patients (100%). 95% CI 0–8%.

Conclusions

Based on the data presented here, there does not appear to be a significant underlying rate of bacterial disc infection in immunocompetent patients presenting with radiculopathy from disc herniation.

### Radiculopathy… [^116haA1V]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy 'suffering'), also commonly referred to as pinched nerve, refers to a set of conditions in which one or more nerves are affected and do not work properly. Radiculopathy can result in pain, weakness, altered sensation or difficulty controlling specific muscles. Pinched nerves arise when surrounding bone or tissue, such as cartilage, muscles or tendons, put pressure on the nerve and disrupt its function. In a radiculopathy, the problem occurs at or near the root of the nerve, shortly after its exit from the spinal cord. However, the pain or other symptoms often radiate to the part of the body served by that nerve. For example, a nerve root impingement in the neck can produce pain and weakness in the forearm. Likewise, an impingement in the lower back or lumbar-sacral spine can be manifested with symptoms in the foot.

The radicular pain that results from a radiculopathy should not be confused with referred pain, which is different both in mechanism and clinical features. Polyradiculopathy refers to the condition where more than one spinal nerve root is affected. Causes Radiculopathy most often is caused by mechanical compression of a nerve root usually at the exit foramen or lateral recess. It may be secondary to intervertebral disk herniation, degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis, facet joint degeneration/hypertrophy, ligamentous hypertrophy, spondylolisthesis, or a combination of these factors. Other possible causes of radiculopathy include neoplastic disease, infections such as shingles, HIV, or Lyme disease, spinal epidural abscess, spinal epidural hematoma, proximal diabetic neuropathy, Tarlov cysts, or, more rarely, sarcoidosis, arachnoiditis, tethered spinal cord syndrome, or transverse myelitis.

Diagnosis Signs and Symptoms Radiculopathy is a diagnosis commonly made by physicians in primary care specialties, orthopedics, physiatry, and neurology. The diagnosis may be suggested by symptoms of pain, numbness, paresthesia, and weakness in a pattern consistent with the distribution of a particular nerve root, such as sciatica. Neck pain or back pain may also be present. Physical examination may reveal motor and sensory deficits in the distribution of a nerve root. In the case of cervical radiculopathy, Spurling's test may elicit or reproduce symptoms radiating down the arm. Similarly, in the case of lumbosacral radiculopathy, a straight leg raise maneuver or a femoral nerve stretch test may demonstrate radiculopathic symptoms down the leg. Deep tendon reflexes may be diminished or absent in areas innervated by a particular nerve root. Diagnosis typically involves electromyography and lumbar puncture.

Shingles is more common among the elderly and immunocompromised; usually pain is followed by appearance of a rash with small blisters along a single dermatome. It can be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. Acute Lyme radiculopathy follows a history of outdoor activities during warmer months in likely tick habitats in the previous 1–12 weeks. Lyme can also cause a milder, chronic radiculopathy an average of 8 months after the acute illness. Lyme can be confirmed by blood antibody tests and possibly lumbar puncture. If present, the above conditions should be treated immediately. Cancer should be suspected if there is previous history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, or low-back pain that does not decrease by lying down or is unremitting.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^113UQA7e]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

4.2.3. Recommendation 3: definite neuropathic pain

For the level of certainty for definite neuropathic pain, an objective diagnostic test is required to confirm the suspected lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system explaining the pain.

In case of radiculopathies, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging techniques can confirm the presence of nerve root compromise at the relevant spinal level (eg, nerve root compression, flattening of the nerve root, or nerve root displacement). However, limitations mentioned above (eg, high false positive and false negative rate and positional dependence) should be acknowledged. Electrodiagnostic studies may indicate large fibre function compromise but cannot assess small fibre compromise.

Confirmative objective diagnostic tests are rarely available in the nonspecialist environment (eg, primary care) or lower resource settings or may not be indicated at least initially (eg, in spine-related leg pain where serious pathology is not expected). However, patients may still fulfill all criteria for the classification of probable neuropathic pain, and treatment according to the neuropathic treatment guidelines in this context should be considered. Even if only the requirements for possible neuropathic pain are met, but a clinician has very strong suspicion for the presence of neuropathic pain (eg, relevant motor signs are apparent and fit the symptom image or a patient rates high on neuropathic pain screening tools), treatments targeting neuropathic pain may be appropriate and indicated where potential benefits for the individual outweigh risks. This interpretation of the clinical grading system will enable clinicians in lower resourced settings to make appropriate clinical decisions when indicated.

4.3. Future directions in research

The recommendations from this working group serve as a foundation for future scientific efforts. The following have been identified as priority areas:
(1) Agreement on diagnostic criteria for each case definition (somatic-referred pain, radicular pain with or without radiculopathy) to standardise participant selection for clinical studies and facilitate pooling of data.
(2) Incorporation of case definitions and the adapted neuropathic pain grading system in future studies of spine-related leg pain to facilitate improved patient profiling and translation to clinical settings.
(3) Exploration of the value of case definitions and the adapted neuropathic pain grading system as stratification tools to identify groups of people for whom specific interventions may be appropriate.
(4) Operationalising the recommendations into trial design and monitoring outcomes to evaluate whether these recommendations help to improve trial quality and ability to interpret true efficacy for people with spine-related leg pain

### Treatment… [^112ho8vA]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

When the space between two adjacent vertebrae narrows, compression of a nerve root emerging from the spinal cord may result in radiculopathy. Radiculopathy is characterized by sensory and motor disturbances, such as severe pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, back, or leg, accompanied by muscle weakness. Less commonly, direct pressure on the spinal cord may result in myelopathy, characterized by global weakness, gait dysfunction, loss of balance, and loss of bowel or bladder control. The patient may experience shocks in hands and legs because of nerve compression and lack of blood flow. If vertebrae of the neck are involved it is labelled cervical spondylosis. Lower back spondylosis is labeled lumbar spondylosis. The term is from Ancient Greek σπόνδυλος spóndylos, "a vertebra", in plural "vertebrae" + osis, "a process or condition".

Signs and symptoms Cervical spondylosis In cervical spondylosis, a patient may be presented with dull neck pain with neck stiffness in the initial stages of the disease. As the disease progresses, symptoms related to radiculopathy or myelopathy can occur. Reduced range of motion of the neck is the most frequent objective finding on physical examination. In cervical radiculopathy, there would be numbness, tingling, or burning pain at the skin area supplied by the spinal nerve, shooting pain along the course of the spinal nerve, or weakness or absent tendon reflex of the muscle supplied by the nerve. This symptom can be provoked by neck extension. Therefore, Spurling's test, which take advantage of this phenomenon, is performed by extending and laterally flexing the patient's head and placing downward pressure on it to narrow the intervertebral foramen.

Neck or shoulder pain on the ipsilateral side indicates a positive result for this test. A positive test result is not necessarily a positive result for spondylosis and as such additional testing is required. In cervical myelopathy, almost always involves both the upper and lower limbs. A person may experience difficult gait or limb stiffness in the early stages of the disease. Iliopsoas muscle is the first group of muscles that is affected. Lower limb weaknesses without any upper limb involvement should raise the suspicion of thoracic cord compression. Finger escape sign is performed to detect the weakness of the fingers. A person's forearm is pronated and the fingers are extended. If the person has myelopathy, there will be slow abduction and flexion of the fingers on the ulnar side. The degree of loss of sensation may be different on both upper limbs. Lhermitte sign is performed by asking a person to gently extend the neck.

Those with cervical myelopathy will produce a feeling of electrical shock down the spine or arms. Muscle spasticity, hyperreflexia or even clonus are characteristic of myelopathy. Other abnormal reflexes such as Hoffmann's reflex, upward response of plantar reflex, and Wartenberg's sign can also be elicited. Lumbar spondylosis Since the spinal cord ends at L1 or L2 vertebral levels, the job of nerve transmission is continued by spinal nerves for the remaining part of the vertebral canal. Degenerative process of spondylosis such as disc bulging, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the superior articular process all contributes to the narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramen, leading to compression of these spinal nerves that results in radiculopathy-related symptoms.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — prospective comparative surgery study and prognostic factors: A prospective comparative study of lumbar discectomy with or without facetectomy stratified by preoperative risk factors assessed outcomes at 12 months for 740 patients, with three‑month data for 533 patients, and outcomes were defined as either poor or good. The authors concluded that risk factors based on clinical examination and history can predict outcomes following lumbar discectomy, and facetectomy may lead to a higher incidence of chronic low back pain. Because diagnostic criteria were not provided, this potential Level II study provides Level III prognostic evidence that patients with an absence of back pain, an absence of a work‑related injury, presence of a straight leg raising test, distribution of radicular pain including the foot, reflex asymmetry and absence of back pain with straight leg raising have a better prognosis for good outcomes following lumbar discectomy.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^112dgo78]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Although bedside sensory testing may not be sensitive enough to detect sensory signs in some patients, subtle sensory abnormalities were found on quantitative sensory testing. In the absence of sensory signs, but the presence of a diagnostic test confirming a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system (eg, MRI), the grading of probable neuropathic pain is still applicable after careful consideration of causality.

A straight leg raise test, or a slump test, is commonly performed clinically to detect neural tissue components or contributions to spine-related leg pain. However, these tests have limited diagnostic performance when used in isolation. Rather than being diagnostic of radicular pain with or without radiculopathy, these tests may detect neural tissue mechanosensitivity (to load or movement) and, therefore, may provide information about gain of function. As such, it could be argued that responses to straight leg raise or slump testing can be taken into account as part of positive sensory signs in the adapted grading system (criterion 3). However, recent research suggests that these tests can be negative in patients with a clear nerve lesion or disease, particularly in the presence of loss of sensory function. In the upper limb, analogous neural provocation tests have been shown to be positive in patients with widespread or generalised hypersensitivity (eg, nonspecific neck arm pain, whiplash, and fibromyalgia), that is nonneuropathic in nature. It, therefore, remains unknown whether and how much weight such tests should be given when grading neuropathic pain certainty.

Sensory signs may be accompanied by motor signs, eg, myotomal or reflex deficit relevant to the root lesion or disease. Although motor signs are not part of the examination of the somatosensory system, and, therefore, not a requisite for the determination of the presence of neuropathic pain, loss of motor function relevant to the patient's presentation may increase the suspicion of a nerve root lesion. The decision about whether the loss of motor function is relevant to the condition is derived from the collective of information triangulated throughout the examination.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115bLZws]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 4
Seated slump test: 1) While seated, the patient is instructed to place her hands behind her back and then slump into cervical, thoracic, and lumbar flexion; 2) The examiner then extends the knee and dorsiflexes the ankle of the affected leg (A); 3) The test is positive if the patient's typical pain is reproduced with this maneuver and is subsequently relieved with neck extension (B).

For lumbar disc herniations, the seated slump test has a sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.83, which is overall superior to the straight leg raise test (sensitivity of 0.52 and specificity of 0.89). The predictive value of the seated slump test for lumbar radicular pain is not ideal. In patients with a negative seated slump test but high clinical suspicion for radicular pain, conservative management can be pursued despite the negative test. Additionally, the patient can be referred to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist for further evaluation. Of note, thorough discussion of the femoral nerve stretch test is beyond the scope of this article, but this test has also been shown to have a high likelihood ratio for mid-lumbar nerve root impingement.

Lumbar and lumbosacral radiculopathy physical examination tests — Neurological and nerve root tension tests had variable rates (low-to-high) of sensitivity and specificity for detection of lumbar and lumbosacral radiculopathy, and studies used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), surgery, or a combination as reference standards. Reported likelihood ratios were: Self-Reported Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) score LR+: 1.87, LR-: 2.4; sensation LR+: 1.66, LR-: 1.37; strength LR+: 1.8, LR-: 1.76; reflexes LR+: 4, LR-: 1.8; Lowe limb neuro-dynamic tests (LLNDTs) LR+: 1.84, LR-: 2.71; overall, evidence indicates some benefits that slightly outweigh harms, but due to high variability in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Interpretation… [^111mdRyr]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

The straight leg raise is a test that can be performed during a physical examination, with the leg being lifted actively by the patient or passively by the clinician. If the straight leg raise is done actively by the patient, it is a test of functional leg strength, particularly the rectus femoris element of the quadriceps. If carried out passively, it is used to determine whether a patient with low back pain has an underlying nerve root sensitivity, often located at L5. The rest of this article relates to the passive version of the test. Technique With the patient lying down on their back on an examination table or exam floor, the examiner lifts the patient's leg while the knee is straight. A variation is to lift the leg while the patient is sitting. However, this reduces the sensitivity of the test.

In order to make this test more specific, the ankle can be dorsiflexed and the cervical spine flexed. This increases the stretching of the nerve root and dura. Interpretation If the patient experiences sciatic pain, and more specifically pain radiating down the leg, when the straight leg is at an angle of between 30 and 70 degrees, then the test is positive and a herniated disk is a possible cause of the pain. A negative test suggests a likely different cause for back pain. A positive straight leg test reproduces radiating leg pain. If it only causes back pain, then the test is negative. A meta-analysis reported the straight-leg test as having:

- sensitivity 91%
- **specificity 26% If raising the opposite leg causes pain**:

- sensitivity 29%
- specificity 88%. Lasègue's sign Lasègue's sign was named after Charles Lasègue. In 1864 Lasègue's medical student J. J.

Forst described the signs of developing low back pain while straightening the knee when the leg has already been lifted. In 1880 Serbian doctor Laza Lazarević described the straight leg raise test as it is used today, so the sign is often named Lazarević's sign in Serbia and some other countries. See also

Special Testing

If there is suspicion of juvenile ankylosing spondylitis, a modified Schober test can be performed remotely. The straight leg raise (SLR) can be performed in patients with suspected disc herniation affecting the L4-S1 nerve roots where the reproduction of sciatic pain is a positive test. A caregiver should be assigned to passively raise the patient's leg, ensuring that it is kept straight. Initially, a seated SLR may be done and if it is negative, a standard supine SLR is suggested. Similarly, a contralateral SLR and reverse SLR can be performed remotely to evaluate for the possibility of central disc herniation or L2-L4 radiculopathy, respectively. Another useful test for lumbar radiculopathy that can be performed remotely without an assistant is the slump test (Figures 1A and). In younger athletic patients in which spondylolysis is suspected, the stork/Gillet test for facet joint and posterior element pain can be performed without the need of a caregiver. For lumbar segmental instability, the cluster of Rehorst can be performed with the help of a caregiver. It consists of a lumbar thrust, prone instability test, Beighton score as well as an assessment of pain and other abnormal signs on active trunk flexion/extension. The Beighton score can be used to remotely assess joint hypermobility of the trunk, knee, elbow, thumb, and small finger, and has been validated in children ages 6 to 12. The prone instability test may be more difficult to perform but can be accomplished with the help of a reliable caregiver. Although patients are unable to perform a lumbar thrust independently, an untrained assisstant may attempt it with graded pressure, making sure not to elicit excess pain.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^117KFSft]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Neuraxial steroids — delivery considerations and inflammatory rationale: Delivery of interventional technology involves the type of procedures, frequency of procedures, drugs injected, with minimization or avoidance of complications. The literature, though enormous, provides only some guidance which is not conclusive, and Based on the principles of EBM, the average relief per procedure if feasible is considered as the recommended duration if it is safely performed without complications. Evidence on inflammatory mediators in disc herniation and radiculopathy is mixed: Scuderi et al were unable to identify the presence of inflammatory peptides in epidural lavage of symptomatic radicular pain, whereas de Souza Grava et al indicated that specific cytokines released during the inflammatory process induced by the herniated intervertebral disc play a fundamental role and that the maintenance of this inflammation may be the most important point for the chronification of the pain. In animal data, Cuéllar et al performed epidural lavage in 48 rats after L5 dorsal root ganglion exposure to autologous nucleus pulposus showing elevation of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ — all attenuated by IFN-γ blockade, and Shamji et al noted altered gait in a model of noncompressive disc herniation with radiculopathy despite absent systematic inflammation with mechanical allodynia, local inflammation, and autoreactive immune activation. In patients, Brisby et al assessed proinflammatory cytokines in 39 patients with disc herniation and sciatica; IL-8 in cerebrospinal fluid was increased in 12 out of 39 patients and correlated with short pain duration and more pronounced herniation, with normal IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in almost all patients, yet no relationship was seen between IL-8 and pain intensity, positive neurological findings, or a positive straight leg raising test. Overall, the complex mechanism of discogenic pain includes chemical nociception leading to low back pain with or without disc herniation.

### Female overrepresentation in low back-related leg pain: a retrospective study of the autonomic response to a minimally invasive procedure [^112grva7]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, neither method can be easily implemented in clinical practice. The results of the current study suggest the relevance of specific parameters. It seems clinically important to determine whether a more sophisticated statistical method allows predicting the presence of CS without the need to perform QST or register the ANS response to noxious stimuli. Thus, we proposed a decision tree method. To exemplify this idea, for the purpose of future studies, we built an example of a decision tree based on the current study sample (Figure 2). Nociplastic pain is highly probable if the LBLP subject is female and the result of a positive SLR test is lower than 45 degrees. If the SLR test result is higher than or equal to 45 degrees, a negative result on the Bragard test will have diagnostic value. However, it is not clear if a positive Bragard test result excludes the probability of NP. The logistic regression model (Figure 3) confirmed the presented classification tree to a certain extent, but the tree should be verified in a larger group of subjects because of its limited reliability.

The classification tree underlines the importance of functional tests. These tests are widely considered neurotension tests that can suggest the origin of radicular pain. However, false-positive results in cases not specific to lumbar radiculopathy but presenting muscle tightness have been indicated as a possible factor that may inflate the sensitivity of the SLR test. MPS syndrome affects a group of muscles via key trigger points followed by satellite trigger points. Marinho et aldemonstrated the physiological soft tissue continuity between the hip and the ankle joint. Based on this, we can assume that positive SLR results among LBLP patients presenting with gluteal syndrome are due to muscle rather than neural tension. A positive SLR result is mentioned as a sign of gluteal syndrome in the ICD 11. It seems that a detailed SLR examination could demonstrate a specific pain-exacerbating angle of the leg raise. The cluster comprising a negative Bragard test result and an SLR result greater than 45 degrees can be hypothetically explained as the provocation of sensation due to muscle shortening, which can be misinterpreted as sciatic nerve irritation. Some authors previously suggested that a positive SLR test can result from "tight hamstring syndrome", characterized by the tightness of the lumbar and ischiocrural muscles.

Further studies should be conducted to obtain a more precise definition involving a cluster of signs, symptoms, and clinical parameters for predicting NP.

4.1.2. Radicular pain without radiculopathy

Radicular pain in the absence of a radiculopathy would not meet all the current grading scheme criteria for classification as neuropathic pain (see above for a lesion which is not detectable with sensory examination). This does not preclude the coexistence of nonneuropathic pain with other comorbid pain conditions (eg, somatic-referred pain).

4.1.3. Radicular pain with radiculopathy

Radicular pain with radiculopathy (painful radiculopathy) meets the current grading system criteria for classification as neuropathic pain, correlating with the ICD-11 definition of neuropathic pain in painful radiculopathy. This does not preclude the coexistence of neuropathic pain in this case with other nonneuropathic pain, eg, somatic-referred pain. Radiculopathy with only somatic-referred pain would not meet the current grading scheme criteria for neuropathic pain.

4.2. Adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system to spine-related pain

The neuropathic pain grading systemwas developed to assist clinicians and researchers in determining whether patients have neuropathic pain (or a combination of another pain type and neuropathic pain) and the level of confidence associated with that decision. Based on clinical and laboratory examination findings, patients are classified as having no neuropathic pain or possible, probable, or definite neuropathic pain.

The requirements for possible neuropathic pain are as follows:
(1) History of relevant neurological lesion or disease and
(2) Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible.

The requirement for probable neuropathic pain is that pain is associated with sensory signs in the same neuroanatomically plausible distribution. Alternatively, possible neuropathic pain with the absence of cutaneous sensory signs but with the presence of a confirmed diagnostic test is also classified as probable neuropathic pain.

### Physical examination signs, clinical symptoms, and their relationship to electrodiagnostic findings and the presence of radiculopathy [^115oJvJq]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The validity of the history and physical examination varies with study method and the gold standard used. In general, symptoms are more sensitive than specific, and most patients with radiculopathy do present with some characteristic complaints. With the exception of the ipsilateral SLR, most physical examination findings are more specific than sensitive. In patients with suspected radiculopathy, having at least one abnormal physical examination finding makes the probability of having an abnormal electrodiagnostic study more likely than if the results of the physical examination are normal. Having a normal physical examination, however, does not rule out the possibility of having a radiculopathy that is revealed either electrodiagnostically or surgically. Although the history and physical examination may not be perfect tools for the diagnosis of radiculopathy or predicting electrodiagnostic outcome, they are an essential part of the clinical evaluation to assist in formulating a differential diagnosis and guiding the electrodiagnostic study.

### Measurement of hip range of flexion-extension and straight-leg raising [^1143PBeu]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

We believe there is a degree of inaccuracy in the usual methods of evaluation of range at the hip in the sagittal plane, ie, flexion-extension. We describe a simple method of measuring more accurately the range of hip flexion-extension, presuming such ranges of motion should relate to the anatomic position of the pelvis. We used this technique for the measurement of flexion and extension of the left hip in a cohort of 200 healthy individuals; we found a wide range of both flexion (80 degrees-140 degrees) and extension (5 degrees-40 degrees). Especially with respect to extension, we believe more conventional methods underestimate the ranges of motion. As a corollary to this study, we suggest some reappraisal of the straight-leg-raising test by which pain from nerve root tension can be distinguished from a source of pain arising locally in intervertebral joints for mechanical reasons or from the hip itself. We recommend the method described as being useful in the consulting office.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113pSq1m]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical examination tests have poor sensitivity and/or specificity for identifying radiculopathy when used in isolation, whether radiculopathy is due to disc herniation or other causes. Nevertheless, recommended physical examination maneuvers for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy include: manual muscle testing (positive predictive value [PPV] of ankle dorsiflexion weakness 69% and lateral four toe extension weakness 76% for L4/5 radiculopathy), sensory testing (PPV 76% and 50% for sensory abnormalities in the L5 and S1 dermatomes, respectively), supine straight leg raise (sensitivity 0.67, superior to the seated straight leg raise, sensitivity 0.41), supine Lasegue's sign (sensitivity 0.77–0.83), and supine crossed Lasegue's sign (specificity 0.74–0.89).,

Other physical examination maneuvers which may aid in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy include reflexes at the patellar and Achilles tendons. Ipsilateral absent or reduced reflexes at the patellar tendon (sensitivity 0.18–0.67; specificity 0.66–0.90) and Achilles tendon (sensitivity 0.14–0.67; specificity 0.60–0.93) suggest patients may have L4 or L5/S1 radiculopathies, respectively.

Imaging modalities, particularly MRI, are frequently used to investigate low back pain and/or suspected radiculopathy. However, abnormalities on MRI are highly prevalent, even among persons who are asymptomatic. Consequently, resource stewardship organizations such as Choosing Wisely (USA) and Choosing Wisely Canada, as well as numerous specialty societies recommend judicious selection of patients who require imaging as well as appropriate use of imaging modalities. In one systematic review, the sensitivity of MRI for detecting lumbosacral radiculopathy was 0.25 and the specificity was 0.92. Thus MRI may have value in confirming the presence of radiculopathy in patients with symptoms that have not resolved and who are considering surgical intervention.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114uMhwB]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

4.2.2. Recommendation 2: probable neuropathic pain

The pain is associated with sensory signs in the same neuroanatomically plausible distribution (see above on pain distribution vs distribution of sensory signs). This can be probed through a clinical examination, eg, bedside sensory testing, which should provide supporting evidence for the suspected nerve root lesion for criterion 3 (Fig. 5) to be met.

c)The area of sensory changes may extend beyond or overlap the area of pain. Sometimes, nociceptive pain may also be accompanied by the loss of function. However, this often does not follow neuroanatomical borders, is not reproducible, and has mainly been reported with sensitive laboratory tests (eg, quantitative sensory testing) rather than with bedside sensory examinations.

Sensory signs in the relevant neuroanatomical distribution are typically negative sensory signs, ie, partial or complete sensory loss, indicative of a nerve conduction slowing or block or axotomy, respectively. Loss of function may occur in large or small sensory nerve fibres. As such, assessment of touch, vibration, pinprick, and cold and warm sensitivity is crucial for the examination of large and small fibre function. Positive sensory signs, such as tactile allodyniaand thermal hyperalgesia, have been documented in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain or radiculopathy. Sensory gain can mask sensory loss, making it difficult to detect the latter with currently available bedside sensory tests. With the revised neuropathic pain grading system, positive sensory signs in the absence of sensory loss are deemed sufficient to satisfy the classification of probable neuropathic pain, as long as they are in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution. The expert panel agreed, although not unanimously, that positive sensory signs do not weigh as strongly as an indicator of a nerve lesion compared with sensory loss. However, in the absence of high-quality data, no recommendation could be made whether positive sensory signs taken in isolation are sufficient to fulfill the criteria of probable neuropathic pain in the context of spine-related leg pain.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113MwM4Q]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and diagnostic approach — For patients with low back pain, we recommend the history and physical examination include evaluation for progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits and other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection) (Strong for). For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) are present (Strong for). For patients with acute low back pain, without focal neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or performing invasive diagnostic tests (Strong against). For patients with low back pain, we suggest assessing psychosocial factors and using predictive screening instruments (e.g. STarT Back and The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire) to inform treatment planning (Weak for). For patients with low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific physical examination maneuvers to assist in the diagnosis of facet or sacroiliac joint pain, or a lumbar/lumbo-sacral radiculopathy (Neither for nor against).

### Granulocytic sarcoma: a rare cause of sciatica [^115DqNRr]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Sciatica is an archaic term with a nebulous meaning. For most clinicians, it refers to a radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve but confusingly is used more generally to describe pain that radiates from the lower back down the leg. It is a common condition with a lifetime incidence of 13–40% and in up to 90% of cases, it occurs due to intervertebral disc herniation. On rare occasion, mass lesions involving the sciatic nerve or lumbosacral plexus can also produce sciatica-like symptoms. Diagnosis of sciatica and its aetiology in the clinic can be challenging. The straight leg raise (SLR) test is often thought to be pathognomonic for sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation; however, it has poor sensitivity and specificity compared with MRI of the lumbar spine, which is the gold standard investigation.

Granulocytic sarcoma, also known as myeloid sarcoma or chloroma, is a rare solid tumour consisting of haematological cells from the myeloid lineage. It is known to be an extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukaemia and can present de novo or as a relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia following stem cell transplantation. Less commonly, it is seen in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myeloid leukaemia. The locations affected are diverse, with the most common being bone, periosteum, soft tissue, lymph node and skin. More rarely, the genitourinary system and nervous system can be involved.

### The sensitivity of the seated straight-leg raise test compared with the supine straight-leg raise test in patients presenting with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of lumbar nerve root compression [^1166zCaE]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the sensitivity of 2 methods of performing the straight-leg raise (SLR) test, one in the supine position and the other in the seated position, in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy.

Design

A cohort study in which patients with signs and symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results available for review at the time of participation were assessed with both the supine and the seated SLR test.

Setting

A large neurosurgical referral office.

Participants

Seventy-one consecutive patients with signs and symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy referred for evaluation of low back pain were prospectively recruited.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Supine SLR and seated SLR. MRI was used as the criterion standard.

Results

The sensitivity of the supine SLR test was .67 compared with a sensitivity of .41 of the seated SLR test (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

The traditional SLR test performed in a supine position is more sensitive in reproducing leg pain than the seated SLR test in patients presenting with signs of and symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy and MRI evidence of nerve root compression.

Straight leg raise — this dural and lower-limb nerve mobility sign is measured categorically as positive/negative by passively raising the lower extremity with the hip flexed and knee extended, and the test is positive when lower extremity radiating/radicular pain is reproduced; in patients with a new episode of pain radiating below the gluteal fold, reliability was good for identifying pain in a dermatomal distribution (κ = 0.68) and moderate for identifying patients with symptoms for angles below 45° (κ = 0.43), with instrument variations noted as none.

The evaluation of patients with suspected lumbar radiculopathy is one of the most common reasons patients are referred for electrodiagnostic testing. The utility of this study depends on the expertise of the physician who plans, performs, and completes the study. This article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of electrodiagnosis to make this diagnosis, as well as the clinical reasoning of appropriate study planning. The current use of electrodiagnostic testing to determine prognosis and treatment outcomes is also discussed.

### The bothersomeness of sciatica: patients' self-report of paresthesia, weakness and leg pain [^1178pZzq]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to investigate how patients with sciatica due to disc herniation rate the bothersomeness of paresthesia and weakness as compared to leg pain, and how these symptoms are associated with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 411 patients with clinical signs of radiculopathy. Items from the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index (0 = none to 6 = extremely) were used to establish values for paresthesia, weakness and leg pain. Associations with socio-demographic and clinical variables were analyzed by multiple linear regression. Mean scores (SD) were 4.5 (1.5) for leg pain, 3.4 (1.8) for paresthesia and 2.6 (2.0) for weakness. Women reported higher levels of bothersomeness for all three symptoms with mean scores approximately 10% higher than men. In the multivariate models, more severe symptoms were associated with lower physical function and higher emotional distress. Muscular paresis explained 19% of the variability in self-reported weakness, sensory findings explained 10% of the variability in paresthesia, and straight leg raising test explained 9% of the variability in leg pain. In addition to leg pain, paresthesia and weakness should be assessed when measuring symptom severity in sciatica.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^114WAf5G]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back algorithm — evaluation of low back and back-related leg symptoms directs that patients with activity intolerance due to low back pain and/or back-related leg symptoms receive focused medical and work histories and physical examination to search for red flags, with neurologic screening and straight leg raising test and crossed SLR tests. If any red flags or symptoms of spinal stenosis, condition-specific actions are outlined: for dissecting or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, for low probability, sonography; for high probability, emergent CT or MRI scan; for spinal fracture, obtain plain-film radiography of lumbosacral spine, and if negative after 10 days and fracture still suspected or multiple sites of pain, obtain spiral CT, and consider consultation if result is positive or ambiguous; for cancer or infection, obtain CBC, ESR, U/A, note that in cancer or infection plain-film radiography may be negative, consider bone scan, and consultation if studies positive; and for cauda equina syndrome or rapidly progressing neurologic deficit, immediate consultation for studies and/or render definitive care. If symptoms of pseudoclaudication, treat with NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), progressive exercise, and surgery if severe or fails to improve sufficiently. In the absence of red flags, diagnostic testing is not helpful in the first 4 weeks for either low back or radicular pain; the algorithm then asks about evidence of serious disease with instruction to arrange appropriate treatment or consultation, and also about evidence of nonspinal problems causing back complaints.

### Effects of adding a neurodynamic mobilization to motor control training in patients with lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation: a randomized clinical trial [^114whfeE]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the inclusion of neural mobilization into a motor control exercise program on pain, related disability, neuropathic symptoms, straight leg raise, and pressure pain threshold in lumbar radiculopathy.

Design

This is a randomized clinical trial.

Methods

Individuals with low back pain, with confirmed disc herniation, and lumbar radiculopathy were randomly assigned to receive eight sessions of either neurodynamic mobilization plus motor control exercises (n = 16) or motor control exercises alone (n = 16). Outcomes included pain, disability, neuropathic symptoms, straight leg raise, and pressure pain threshold at baseline, after four visits, after eight visits, and after 2 mos.

Results

There were no between-groups differences for pain, related disability, or pressure pain threshold at any follow-up period because both groups get similar and large improvements. Patients assigned to the neurodynamic program group experienced better improvements in neuropathic symptoms and the straight leg raise compared with the motor control exercise group (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The addition of neurodynamic mobilization to a motor control exercise program leads to reductions in neuropathic symptoms and mechanical sensitivity (straight leg raise) but did not result in greater changes of pain, related disability, or pressure pain threshold over motor control exercises program alone in subjects with lumbar radiculopathy. Future trials are needed to further confirm these findings because between-groups differences did not reach clinically relevance.

### Negative neurodynamic tests Do not exclude neural dysfunction in patients with entrapment neuropathies [^116Wc2xp]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study suggest that > 54% of patients with CTS have negative neurodynamic tests despite a clear median nerve dysfunction as proven with electrodiagnostic tests. Interestingly, patients with negative ULNTs have a somatosensory phenotype, indicating a more pronounced impairment of warm detection sense than patients with positive ULNTs. Our findings suggest that neurodynamic tests in isolation are not sufficient to determine neural involvement. Indeed, patients with negative ULNTs seem to have a more pronounced dysfunction of the small unmyelinated nerve fiber population than patients with positive ULNTs.

Our finding that a significant proportion of patients with proven nerve involvement have negative neurodynamic tests is in line with previous studies. For instance, approximately 58% of patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy have a negative straight leg raise, and for CTS, the percentage of positive ULNTs varies from 18% to 72%. This variation in prevalence values among the different studies is most likely explained by the different performances of ULNTs and the varying criteria for a positive test. For instance, some studies used structural differentiation as an essential criterion to rate a neurodynamic test as positive, whereas structural differentiation was not required for a positive test outcome in other studies. We strictly adhered to the recommended criteria for a standardized performance and interpretation of ULNTs, which includes structural differentiation as an essential test criterion.

Not surprisingly, both ULNTs biasing the median nerve were positive only in approximately 42% of our patients. Originally, the ULNT 1 was developed to increase the strain on the brachial plexus, whereas ULNT 2a includes a prolonged period of strain on the distal median nerve. This may explain why positive neurodynamic tests were more prevalent for the ULNT 2a than the ULNT 1. Following the principles of sequencing, it could be argued that further test adjustment, such that the wrist is moved into dorsal extension first, would increase the likelihood of a positive neurodynamic test in patients with CTS. A recent cadaver study has however demonstrated that changing the order of movement during neurodynamic testing does not affect the extent of strain of the median nerve at the distal forearm.

### Normalization of spinal cord displacement with the straight leg raise and resolution of sciatica in patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation: a 1.5-year follow-up study [^114t5JfS]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A controlled radiologic follow-up study.

Objective

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether changes in cord excursion with straight leg raise test (SLR) at 1.5-year follow-up time accompany changes in clinical symptoms.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (LIDH) is known to be a key cause of sciatica. Previously, we found that a significant limitation of neural displacement (66.6%) was evident with the SLR on the symptomatic side of patients with subacute single level posterolateral LIDH.

Methods

Fourteen patients with significant sciatic symptoms due to a subacute single-level posterolateral LIDH were reassessed clinically and radiologically at 1.5 years follow-up with a 1.5T MRI scanner. Displacement of the conus medullaris during the unilateral and bilateral SLR was quantified reliably with a randomized procedure and compared between SLRs and to data from baseline. Multivariate regression models and backward variable selection method were employed to identify variables more strongly associated with a decrease in low back pain (LBP) and radicular symptoms.

Results

Compared with previously presented baseline values, the data showed a significant increase in neural sliding in all the quantified maneuvers (P ≤ 0.01), and particularly of 2.52mm (P ≤ 0.001) with the symptomatic SLR. Increase in neural sliding correlated significantly with decrease of both radicular symptoms (Pearson = -0.719, P ≤ 0.001) and LBP (Pearson = -0.693, P ≤ 0.001). Multivariate regression models and backward variable selection method confirmed the improvement of neural sliding effects (P ≤ 0.004) as the main variable being associated with improvement of self-reported clinical symptoms.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, these are the first noninvasive data to objectively support the association between increase in magnitude of neural adaptive movement and resolution of both radicular and LBP symptoms in in vivo and structurally intact human subjects.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — Majlesi et al case-control testing of the Slump test versus straight leg raise reports that among 75 patients (38 MRI-confirmed and 37 negative), the Slump test sensitivity was 0.84 with specificity 0.83, while the straight leg raise sensitivity was 0.52 with specificity 0.89. Positive predictive values were 0.84 (CI, 0.74–0.90) for Slump and 0.83 (CI, 0.67–0.92) for straight leg raise, and negative predictive values were 0.83 (CI, 0.73–0.90) and 0.64 (CI, 0.57–0.69), respectively; the authors stated the Slump test "may be a valuable tool" and "could be used extensively", and the study provides Level III diagnostic evidence that the Slump test and straight leg raise have similar specificity but the Slump test is more sensitive.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111sJMPi]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline glossary — serious neurologic conditions and examination are characterized as follows: Cauda equina syndrome is compression on nerve roots in the lumbosacral spine, usually due to a massive, centrally herniated disc or severe lumbar spinal stenosis, which can result in urinary retention or incontinence from loss of sphincter function, bilateral motor weakness of the lower extremities, and saddle anesthesia; a progressive neurologic deficit is an abnormal finding of altered function attributable to pathology of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain that worsens with serial examination, with examples including decreased sensation progressing to loss of sensation or reflexes moving from diminished to absent; and the straight leg raise test is a procedure in which the hip is flexed with the knee extended to tension the L4-S1 nerve roots and reproduce a patient's lower extremity symptoms and is usually considered positive when symptoms are reproduced between 30 and 70 degrees of hip flexion, with reproduction on the unaffected leg considered a positive crossed straight leg raise test.

### The crossed femoral nerve stretch test to improve diagnostic sensitivity for the high lumbar radiculopathy: 2 case reports [^114asRFt]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

The femoral nerve stretch test (FNST) is commonly used to assess high lumbar radiculopathy. It may be falsely positive secondary to tight or injured muscles of the anterior thigh, and to osseous or joint pathology in and about the hip. We report on the crossed FNST, which may improve the specificity of the FNST. Two cases that occurred within 2 months are presented. The physical examinations suggested high lumbar radiculopathy, which was confirmed by both the FNST and crossed FNST. The crossed FNST may thus be a valuable screening test that further supports a diagnosis of upper lumbar radiculopathy. Further study is necessary to identify its prevalence in the assessment of the high lumbar radiculopathy.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^112CvvZt]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — disc herniation–related inflammation and biomarkers: Clinical and animal studies link intervertebral disc herniation and radiculopathy with inflammatory mechanisms. Scuderi et al were unable to detect inflammatory peptides in epidural lavage from patients with symptomatic radicular pain due to herniated disc disease, while de Souza Grava et al indicated that cytokines released during the inflammatory process induced by herniated intervertebral disc play a fundamental role in mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and that maintaining this inflammation may drive pain chronification. In a rat model, Shamji et al concluded there is an inflammatory component in nociceptive disc herniation with radiculopathy, with systemic inflammation absent but mechanical allodynia, local inflammation, and autoreactive immune activation observed. Cuéllar et al developed an animal model to study biochemical changes in the epidural space after intervertebral disc herniation. In patients with disc herniation and sciatica, Brisby et al assessed cerebrospinal fluid and serum cytokines in 39 patients and found IL-8 increases in 12 out of 39 that correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation, whereas IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α were normal in almost all patients and IL-8 did not relate to pain intensity, positive neurological findings, or a positive straight leg raising test.

### The flip test: a reappraisal [^1159m2g3]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Diagnostic study.

Objective

To assess the construct validity of the flip test as a sign of nerve root tension.

Summary Of Background Data

The flip test is commonly performed in patients with sciatica to confirm or otherwise nerve root tension evidenced by a restricted supine straight leg raise (SLR). Passive extension of the knee with the patient in the erect position and the hip flexed is reported to cause a sudden falling or flipping back of the trunk. Although widely known there are no research articles validating this test.

Methods

Sixty-seven patients with sciatica and magnetic resonance imaging scans confirming disc protrusion and nerve root compression underwent the flip test. The response of the patient was recorded, compared with the supine SLR, and subjected to statistical analysis.

Results

Thirty-three percent of patients felt no pain, 39% felt pain on full extension of the knee, and 28% resisted full extension of the knee due to pain. Only one-third of patients demonstrated a "flip". The response was related to the supine SLR, such that patients with high SLRs tended not to show a painful reaction whereas all patients with a supine SLR below 45 degrees showed a painful response.

Conclusion

We consider that the flip test has been substantially misinterpreted in the past. However, it remains a useful check of nerve root tension but only for patients with supine SLRs below 45 degrees. The most reliable response was not a flip but the demonstration of pain on extension of the knee. We would recommend the term "sitting SLR test", as a more accurate and less misleading name.

### What is the best way to apply the spurling test for cervical radiculopathy? [^11711tNk]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy is based largely on clinical examination, including provocative testing. The most common maneuver was described in 1944 by Spurling and Scoville. Since then, several modifications of the original maneuver have been proposed to improve its value in the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.

Questions/Purposes

We assessed the ability of six known variations of the Spurling test to reproduce the complaints of patients diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 67 patients presenting with cervical radicular-like symptoms and concordant radiographic findings. Each patient underwent six distinct provocative cervical spine maneuvers by two examiners, during which three parameters were recorded: (1) pain intensity (VAS score), (2) paresthesia intensity (0 - no paresthesia, 1 - mild to moderate, and 2 - severe), and (3) characteristic pain distribution (0 - no pain, 1 - neck pain only, 2 - arm pain only, 3 - pain elicited distal to the elbow). The interobserver reliability of the reported VAS score (measured by the intraclass coefficient correlation) ranged from 0.78 to 0.96 and the calculated kappa values of the categorical parameters ranged from 0.58 to 1.0 for paresthesia intensity and from 0.63 to 1.0 for pain distribution. Differences in scores elicited between the two examiners for the 67 patients were resolved by consensus.

Results

A maneuver consisting of extension, lateral bending, and axial compression resulted in the highest VAS score (mean, 7) and was associated with the most distally elicited pain on average (mean, 2.5). The highest paresthesia levels were reported after applying extension, rotation, and axial compression (mean, 1). These maneuvers, however, were the least tolerable, causing discontinuation of the examination on three occasions.

Conclusions

Whenever cervical radiculopathy is suspected our observations suggest the staged provocative maneuvers that should be included in the physical evaluation are extension and lateral bending first, followed by the addition of axial compression in cases with an inconclusive effect.

### A systematic review of the passive straight leg raising test as a diagnostic aid for low back pain (1989 to 2000) [^113nRC39]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review.

Objectives

This systematic review sought papers (January 1989-January 2000) on the passive straight leg raising test (PSLR) as a diagnostic component for low back pain (LBP) to identify, summarize, and assess developments in the test procedure, the factors influencing PSLR outcome, and the clinical significance of that outcome.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies suggested that the PSLR tractioned the sciatic nerve and that diminished leg elevation with reproduced pain indicated low lumbar intervertebral disc pathology.

Methods

Searches on six computerized bibliographic databases identified publications written about the PSLR. Papers were excluded if they were published before January 1989, were non-English language papers, or employed either an active SLR or a PSLR for purposes other than LBP diagnosis. The references of qualifying papers (and the references of references) were searched. Contact with primary authors, and others known to be active in this field, was attempted.

Results

The PSLR procedure remains unchanged. The influence of hip rotation during the PSLR was discussed without consensus. Biomechanical devices improved intra- and interobserver reliability and so increased test reproducibility. Hamstrings were found to have a defensive role in protecting nerve roots by limiting PSLR range in cases of nerve root inflammation. A small diurnal variation in the PSLR may imply a poorer prognosis. A positive PSLR at 4 months after lumbar intervertebral disc surgery predicted poor reoperative outcome, and a negative 4-month PSLR predicted excellent outcome. The influence of psychosocial factors was not discussed, neither was the diagnostic significance of a negative PSLR outcome.

Conclusions

There remains no standard PSLR procedure, no consensus on interpretation of results, and little recognition that a negative PSLR test outcome may be of greater diagnostic value than a positive one. The causal link between LBP pathology and hamstring action remains unclear. There is a need for research into the clinical use of the PSLR; its intra- and interobserver reliability; the influences of age, gender, diurnal variation, and psychosocial factors; and its predictive value in lumbar intervertebral disc surgery.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^111pwwxp]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

When patients report posterior hip or low back pain below the level L5 or the beltline, various causes other than sacroiliitis should be considered, including seronegative spondyloarthropathies, posterior femoro-acetabular pathology, proximal hamstring tendinopathy, piriformis syndrome, stress fracture of the sacrum, and referred pain from lumbar spinal pathology including lumbosacral facet-mediated pain and proximal L5 radiculopathy. Although there are some overlapping characteristics amongst these other diagnoses, the following list helps to correlate various differentials with their particular findings.
Localization of pain to the spine or radiating pain into the lower extremities with a positive straight leg raise may suggest a spinal or spinal nerve pathology.
Concomitant anterior and posterior hip pain with a FABER test producing pain localizing in the groin area may point towards femoro-acetabular pathology.
Tenderness to palpation over the body of the piriformis muscle with a positive FADIR (Hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation) test may suggest piriformis syndrome.
Perineal pain worsened with palpation over the ischial spine may point toward a pudendal neuropathy.
Patients with reproducible pain along with the proximal hamstring muscle or tendon through various active, passive and resisted range of motion may have a hamstring strain, rupture, or tendinopathy.
Axial low back pain that is worse with lumbar extension and positive for lumbar facet loading may be indicative of lumbar facet arthropathy.
Pain localized over the inferior sacrum and coccygeal region may represent sacrocoxalgia or coccydynia.

Understanding the relationship between these various findings and correlated pathologies is crucial to identifying and appropriately addressing a patient's source of low back and posterior hip pain. It is not uncommon for SIJ pain to present concomitantly with some of these other underlying pathologies and having them in your differential will help formulate an appropriate treatment plan for the patient.

Diagnosis of disc-related lumbar pathology — history and physical examination with neurological, motor, sensory, and reflex assessment plus provocative maneuvers are emphasized, sciatica is described as highly sensitive for a clinically important herniated disc, and subjective numbness is reasonably sensitive (0.76) but not specific (0.33) for radiculopathy; a neurologic and musculoskeletal examination may assist in identifying disc herniation, and straight leg raising or cross straight leg raising and motor examination may be crucial; somatic referred pain in the buttock or lower extremity from lumbar pain generators should not be confused with radicular pain, with distinctions lying in pain quality and behavior; radiculitis may also occur with central and foraminal spinal stenosis, nerve root entrapment, annular tears, spondylolisthesis, facet joint cysts, epidural fibrosis, internal disc disruption, or discogenic pain without involvement of other structures.

### Radicular pain… [^115WbQ9A]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Radicular pain, or radiculitis, is pain "radiated" along the dermatome of a nerve due to inflammation or other irritation of the nerve root at its connection to the spinal column. A common form of radiculitis is sciatica – radicular pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve from the lower spine to the lower back, gluteal muscles, back of the upper thigh, calf, and foot as often secondary to nerve root irritation from a spinal disc herniation or from osteophytes in the lumbar region of the spine. Radiculitis indicates inflammation of the spinal nerve root, which may lead to pain in that nerve's distribution without weakness – as opposed to radiculopathy. When the radiating pain is associated with numbness or weakness, the diagnosis is radiculopathy if the lesion is at the nerve root, or myelopathy if at the spinal cord itself.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^112doS4C]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar traction — conflicting and negative evidence with subgroup note: There is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of intermittent lumbar traction for patients with LBP. There is preliminary evidence that a subgroup of patients with signs of nerve root compression, along with peripheralization of symptoms or a positive crossed straight leg raise test, will benefit from intermittent lumbar traction in the prone position. There is moderate evidence that physical therapists should not utilize intermittent or static lumbar traction for reducing symptoms in patients with acute or subacute, nonradicular LBP or in patients with chronic LBP.
