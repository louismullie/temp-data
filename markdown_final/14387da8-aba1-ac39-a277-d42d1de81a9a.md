## Question

what does you call when one teste is smaller than the other

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the correct medical term is when one testicle is smaller than the other. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise terminology for testicular size asymmetry. Then, I should verify whether a small difference is physiologic or pathologic. Next, I will consider the common etiologies that produce clinically meaningful asymmetry. Finally, I will outline how clinicians quantify the difference and when to investigate further, anchoring to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. The correct medical term for one testicle being smaller than the other is testicular asymmetry, or more specifically testicular hypotrophy when one testis is abnormally small relative to the other, whereas compensatory hypertrophy refers to enlargement of the contralateral testis when the other is absent or atrophic; I should double-check that these terms are used consistently in the literature and guidelines, and yes, pediatric urology and varicocele literature routinely describe ipsilateral reduction in testicular volume and contralateral hypertrophy in this context [^111ubZHf] [^111S2maH] [^115NLWuD].

> Wait, let me verify whether a small difference is normal. A modest left–right difference in testicular volume can be physiologic, and normal ranges vary with age and pubertal stage; Tanner staging uses testicular volume thresholds to define pubertal stages, and prepubertal volumes are typically under 4 mL, so a small asymmetry alone is not necessarily pathologic, though persistent or progressive asymmetry warrants evaluation [^117AHX7M] [^116htkdJ].

> I will now examine the common causes of clinically significant asymmetry. Varicocele is a frequent cause in adolescents and adults, with the affected testis often smaller than the contralateral side; guidelines recommend intervention when there is a persistent size difference greater than about 2 mL or 20%, or when there is progressive dysfunction, which operationalizes "smaller" into a measurable threshold for action [^111S2maH] [^111ubZHf]. Cryptorchidism can lead to hypoplastic or atrophic testes even after orchiopexy, and in postpubertal patients with a hypotrophic undescended testis, orchiectomy may be considered if the contralateral testis is normal, reflecting concern for malignancy and limited function of the hypoplastic testis [^112cCP2Z] [^111aVCCb]. Testicular torsion, especially if delayed, causes ischemic atrophy of the affected testis, producing marked asymmetry and often necessitating orchiectomy if nonviable, with salvage declining with time but still possible beyond the classic 6–8 hour window in some cases [^116qJuWG] [^112aMqbU]. Other causes include prior trauma, infection, and primary testicular failure syndromes such as Klinefelter syndrome, which typically presents with small, firm testes and hypogonadism [^115Knnsb].

> Hold on, I should verify how clinicians quantify the difference. Volume asymmetry is commonly assessed with a Prader orchidometer or by scrotal ultrasound using the Lambert formula (length × width × height × 0.71), and guidelines endorse measuring testicular volume as part of the evaluation of male infertility and in adolescents with varicocele; a persistent difference exceeding roughly 20% or 2 mL is considered clinically meaningful in pediatric varicocele algorithms [^115tAZzb] [^113WS4ax] [^111S2maH]. Let me reconsider whether ultrasound adds value beyond orchidometry; yes, ultrasound is more reproducible and allows serial monitoring of asymmetry progression, which is why it is preferred when decisions hinge on small changes over time [^112nTj2B].

> Next, I should review when asymmetry prompts action. In adolescents with varicocele, persistent ipsilateral testicular hypotrophy or progressive dysfunction is an indication to offer repair, whereas observation may be reasonable if asymmetry is mild and stable; this balances the risk of overtreatment against potential fertility benefits, acknowledging that adolescent data are mixed and evolving [^111S2maH] [^111ubZHf]. In adults with a unilateral undescended, hypotrophic testis and a normal contralateral testis, orchiectomy is recommended due to malignancy risk and limited function, whereas testis-sparing approaches are reserved for select scenarios such as a solitary testis or bilateral disease [^111aVCCb] [^112TCoiG]. For acute scrotal pain with suspected torsion, emergent exploration is indicated regardless of exact asymmetry, because time-sensitive salvage is prioritized over imaging delays [^112aMqbU].

> But wait, what if the "smaller" testis is actually absent or vanishing? I should confirm that compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral testis can suggest monorchia, though it is neither perfectly sensitive nor specific; thus, nonpalpable testes or marked asymmetry still warrant surgical exploration to distinguish anorchia, intra-abdominal testis, or ectopia, rather than relying on size alone to make that call [^115NLWuD] [^116R5NBz].

> In summary, I need to ensure the terminology is precise: when one testicle is smaller than the other, the condition is termed testicular asymmetry, with the smaller testis described as hypoplastic or atrophic depending on etiology, and the larger contralateral testis showing compensatory hypertrophy when the other is absent or dysfunctional; clinically, a persistent difference greater than about 2 mL or 20% is considered significant and should prompt evaluation for causes such as varicocele, prior torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma, infection, or primary testicular failure, with management tailored to the underlying diagnosis and patient goals [^111ubZHf] [^111S2maH] [^111aVCCb].

---

When one testicle is smaller than the other, the condition is called **testicular asymmetry** or **testicular hypotrophy**. This is common and often normal, but a size difference greater than 20% or a volume difference of more than 2 mL may indicate pathology such as varicocele, cryptorchidism, testicular torsion, or atrophy from prior injury or infection [^111S2maH] [^111ubZHf]. Persistent or progressive asymmetry warrants **evaluation with a scrotal ultrasound** [^112Mx2Dd] and clinical assessment to identify and treat underlying causes [^115tAZzb].

---

## Medical terminology

- **Testicular asymmetry**: General term for a size difference between the two testicles.
- **Testicular hypotrophy**: Specifically denotes underdevelopment or shrinkage of one testicle.
- **Compensatory hypertrophy**: Enlargement of the contralateral testicle when the other is small or absent [^115NLWuD].

---

## Normal vs. abnormal testicular size differences

A small degree of asymmetry is **normal**; however, a size difference greater than 20% or a volume difference of more than 2 mL is considered clinically significant and may indicate an underlying condition [^111S2maH] [^111ubZHf].

---

## Common causes of testicular asymmetry

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Varicocele | Enlarged scrotal veins causing ipsilateral testicular atrophy [^111S2maH] [^111ubZHf] |
| Cryptorchidism | Undescended testicle leading to hypoplasia or atrophy [^1158yn2N] |
| Testicular torsion | Twisting of the spermatic cord causing ischemia and atrophy [^116qJuWG] |
| Trauma or infection | Previous injury or infection causing testicular atrophy [^114EN95y] |
| Hormonal imbalances | Hypogonadism or other endocrine disorders [^115GBXcH] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

- **Physical examination**: Assess testicular size, consistency, and position [^115GBXcH].
- **Ultrasound**: Gold standard for measuring testicular volume and detecting structural abnormalities [^notfound].
- **Hormonal testing**: Evaluate testosterone, FSH, and LH levels if hormonal imbalance is suspected [^116VvMTb].

---

## Clinical significance and potential complications

Persistent asymmetry can signal underlying pathology and may be associated with **reduced fertility**, **increased malignancy risk** (especially with cryptorchidism or testicular atrophy), and **psychological distress** due to cosmetic concerns [^1158yn2N] [^111iMaQ4].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Varicocele**: Surgical repair (varicocelectomy) if asymmetry is significant or progressive [^111S2maH] [^111ubZHf].
- **Cryptorchidism**: Orchiopexy (surgical descent) ideally before 6–12 months of age [^1158yn2N] [^116t9qb5].
- **Testicular torsion**: Emergency surgical intervention to prevent permanent damage [^112aMqbU].
- **Hormonal therapy**: Testosterone replacement if hypogonadism is diagnosed [^114EN95y].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up with periodic ultrasound and clinical examination is recommended to monitor for progression or complications, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients [^1157vFYQ].

---

Testicular asymmetry is common and often benign, but a significant size difference may indicate an underlying condition. Persistent or progressive asymmetry should be **evaluated with ultrasound and clinical assessment** to identify and treat any underlying causes [^112Mx2Dd].

### Boys equal girls [^116htkdJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

What is normal? Reference standards are a core component of endocrine practice but they come with caveats. Lying below the 2nd or above the 98th centiles — or lying below or above two standard deviations outwith the mean — does not automatically mean that there is underlying pathology. The 'lines in the sand' associated with biochemical reference ranges can be helpful but clinicians will be aware that normal ranges do not encompass all healthy individuals.

Many physiological processes are subject to a similar yes/no classification with the paediatrician deciding whether a child is in puberty or not on the basis of the clinical assessment. The onset of puberty reflects rising gonadotropin secretion with ovarian oestrogen production and subsequent breast development being the key clinical marker of pubertal onset in girls and testicular enlargement > 3mLs the key marker in boys. Breast development on average occurs before the attainment of the 4 mL 'pubertal' testicular volume (just over 11 years of age vs. 12 years) with the implication being that puberty begins earlier in girls than boys.

This matters from a clinical perspective because the earlier that puberty begins in advance of normal timing, the more likely it is that there is an underlying pathological explanation for this. Irrespective of the underlying mechanism, there are effective treatments, notably GnRH analogues, that can safely put puberty on hold.

Pubertal assessment of girls can be complicated by an increased body mass index and a degree of associated lipomastia and there are complicating factors in boys as well. The prepubertal testicle will vary in size between healthy individuals — a normal continuum. Hence a testicular volume of 2.5 mLs in one individual can presumably equate to the same physiological stage of development as a 1.5 mL volume in someone else. Perhaps a 3.5 mL volume (pubertal) in one child will be equivalent from a developmental perspective to a 2.5 mL volume (prepubertal) in someone else. Then there are factors such as the means of assessment — for example clinical examination or ultrasonography — that need to be taken into account. It is not uncommon for my clinical assessment to be different to that of my colleagues, an observation reinforced by more objective data collection.

### Cryptorchidism (undescended testicle) [^111iMaQ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cryptorchidism:

- **Definition**: Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis, is a common congenital abnormality among males that is characterized by the failure of one or both testes to permanently descend.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cryptorchidism is caused due to a disruption in any phase of testicular descent triggered by hereditary, hormonal, anatomical, environmental, or social factors.
- **Disease course**: The disruption in any phase of testicular descent results in cryptorchidism, which causes an increased chance of inguinal hernia, torsion, and trauma that leads to psychological distress in parents. It may also lead to reduced fertility and testicular cancer in adult males.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Orchiectomy for ASA 3 and ASA 4 is associated with 0.49% and 3.31% of mortality risk.

### Empty scrotum: undescended testis or ectopic? [^115Npzpp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

This case of ectopic testis highlights the importance of a thorough first newborn examination followed by senior review when appropriate, and the expertise required to interpret neonatal ultrasounds. Following a provisional diagnosis of unilateral undescended testicle in a newborn, an ultrasound scan was unable to correctly identify the condition, resulting in a delay in diagnosis. The condition was later recognised incidentally, which led to a successful surgical correction. The early clinical examination and recognition of ectopic testis allows a timely surgical intervention preventing potential complications.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

It is generally accepted that investigations are necessary in those cases where the appearance of the genitalia is so ambiguous that sex assignment is not possible at birth or the appearance is not consistent with any prenatal genetic tests. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer and prior to presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of atypical genitalia may be as high as 1 in 300 births, 23 but the birth prevalence of a condition that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as 1 in 5000 births. 24

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear on surgical exploration. 25 These external features can be individually scored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinization score (EMS) 26 (Fig. 1). Routine systematic examination of 423 consecutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412 (98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only 1 of 423 had an EMS of less than 11. 26 In boys with atypical genitalia, a chromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% of those with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadias and 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. 27 In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studies performed over a decade ago revealed a likely cause in about 30% of cases 28 and based on current reports of genetic analysis in XY DSD, a genetic cause may be identified in about 40% of cases. 29 With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it is unclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.

### A systematic review of testicle survival time after a torsion event [^116qJuWG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The time window for possible salvage and survival of a torsed testicle is commonly thought to be 6 to 8 hours. However, survival of torsed testicles with or without subsequent atrophy is known to occur outside that critical time window. In this article, we performed a systematic review of the English literature to provide a more accurate understanding of reported time frames of testicle survival after a torsion event.

Objectives

The primary research question was to determine the relationship between time to treatment and the rate of survival for testicles of male patients presenting with testicular torsion (TT).

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed and structured according to PRISMA guidelines. An exhaustive library search was performed after search strategies were developed for multiple databases that included PubMed, Cochrane library, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and ProQuest Theses and Dissertations. Two different searches were developed including "testicular torsion" and TT with the search term "time" added. Articles specifically reporting TT case series, testicle outcomes, and time to surgical or manual treatment were selected for review. In addition to and preceding the systematic review, an exhaustive manual search of the literature was also performed by the authors. As a result of these searches, a total of 30 studies with data considered relevant to the research question were included. The information extracted from the articles was tabulated with regard to time intervals to treatment and survival outcome.

Results

The systematic review process and protocol are reported in this article. A total of 30 studies were found that reported case series of TT patients and their outcomes as well as time to treatment reported in useful time frames. From these reports, a total of 2116 TT patients were culled, and their outcomes and time to treatment are reported. Because the time to treatment was reported variously in different case series, the 3 most common formats for reporting time to treatment and outcome were used. When overlap between the tables existed, the data were tallied and reported cumulatively. When reported in 6-hour intervals (1,283 patients), survival at 0 to 6 hours was 97.2%; 7 to 12 hours, 79.3%; 13 to 18 hours, 61.3%; 19 to 24 hours, 42.5%; 25 to 48 hours, 24.4%; and greater than 48 hours, 7.4%. Moreover, we reported cumulative survival data based on reporting for all 3 groups of patients. Testicular salvage in the first 12 hours is 90.4%, from 13 to 24 hours survival is 54.0%, and beyond 24 hours survival is 18.1%. Testicle survival after TT was significant beyond the commonly held 6 to 8 hour time frame and even after more than 24 hours of ischemia.

Conclusions

Survival of the testicle irrespective of subsequent atrophy, decreased spermatogenesis or impaired endocrine function after TT can be much longer than the 6 to 8 hours that is commonly taught. Our systematic review of the literature demonstrates that survival percentages are significant even past 24 hours of torsion. This information should encourage aggressive management of patients presenting with TT pain that has been ongoing for many hours.

### The nonpalpable testis: a narrative review [^113g7PRq]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

While the nonpalpable testis represents a small portion of all cryptorchid testes, it remains a clinical challenge for pediatric urologists. Controversy exists surrounding the best evaluation and management of this entity. In this review we update what is known about the nonpalpable testis, including the etiology, preoperative evaluation and best surgical management as well as novel techniques and ongoing controversies.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed® and MEDLINE® from January 2000 to January 2017 using relevant key terms. Of 367 articles 115 were considered for inclusion based on a priori design. Using a narrative review format, an update on the evaluation and management of the nonpalpable testis including novel concepts and techniques was synthesized.

Results

The nonpalpable testis should be evaluated by physical examination only. Imaging is not indicated for routine cases. The optimal surgical approach and technique remain debatable but several novel techniques have been described. Due to the rarity of the nonpalpable testis, randomized controlled trials and other quality comparisons are difficult. Therefore, management remains controversial.

Conclusions

Evaluation and management of the nonpalpable testis remain difficult, and some aspects are still debated. Future research should focus on multi-institutional collaborative trials to determine the optimal operative management.

### Boys equal girls [^11477SiJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

An interesting component of the paper by Demir and colleagues is the fact that it underlines how the onset of increased gonadotropin production at puberty actually occurs at a similar time in boys as girls. In this cohort the increase in mean total U‐LH concentrations appeared shortly after the age of 10 years in males and females and so the sexes have more in common than was previously thought to be the case. Whilst the attainment of a 4 mL testicular volume in boys may occur later than the presence of clinical breast tissue in girls, the physiological process underpinning these changes will have started many months previously when the '4 mL' testicle was much smaller. Demir and colleagues show us that there will already be an incremental 'pubertal' background rise in LH production in some boys with a 1 mL testicular volume who from a more traditional clinical perspective are not yet in puberty. This study has helpfully educated biologists and health professionals about the events taking place before the > 3 mL testicular 'line in the sand'.

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^113oHmfD]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Undescended testicle (UT) is present at birth with a frequency varying from 2% to 8%: in Italy the estimated prevalence is 3.5% in term babies. UT includes both a non-palpable testis and a palpable supra-scrotal testis which cannot be pulled down to the scrotum or does not remain there by six months of age. UT should be differed from retractile testis (RT), a condition where the testis is palpable in the supra-scrotal region but, once pulled down to the scrotum, remains there after the exhaustion of the cremasteric activity. In this case RT should not be treated. Differential diagnosis between a true RT and a supra-scrotal UT may not be easy.

The difficulty in achieving consensus on UT management depends largely on the long follow-up from diagnosis until the attainment of full testicular function in adulthood. An up-to-date evidence-based Consensus on the treatment of UT has been published with the following recommendations: a) hormones are not recommended; b) orchidopexy should be performed between 6 and 12 months of age, or upon diagnosis, if it occurs later; c) orchidopexy should be performed at centres with both paediatric surgeons or urologists and paediatric anaesthesiologists. These recommendations, in line with those by Swiss surgeons, are important in order to avoid adulthood consequences of UT, such as azoospermia or oligospermia, endocrine insufficiency and possible tumoral degeneration.

Retractile testis (RT) may be more difficult to diagnose. According to the Consensus, RT should not undergo surgery but should be followed-up once yearly given the possible risk of reascent.

In Italy, current practices on UT management are little known and they appear to be heterogeneous. We hypothesised a non-adherence to the Nordic Consensus guidelines, with a delay in orchidopexy. We carried out a retrospective observational study among Italian Family Paediatricians (FP) on a cohort of children with UT in order to describe the current management of cryptorchidism in Italy, before the Consensus publication. Since the differential diagnosis between UT and RT can be problematic, we decided to describe the management of RT cases separately.

### Fetal diagnosis of testicular torsion: what shall we tell the parents? [^114RFqSF]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are to present our collective experience with the prenatal diagnosis of testicular torsion and to propose a possible prenatal management scheme.

Methods

We retrospectively collected and reviewed all medical records of cases that were diagnosed with perinatal testicular torsion in our medical center between the years 2002 and 2013. Prenatal torsion was categorized as torsion diagnosed in utero or on immediate newborn examination.

Results

A total of five unilateral prenatal torsions were diagnosed. Two fetuses were diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. In both cases, cesarean section was performed immediately upon diagnosis. One newborn underwent immediate orchiectomy with contralateral orchiopexy. Torsion was confirmed by pathological examination. The other was managed conservatively, just as the three newborns who were diagnosed immediately after birth. On follow-up scan, the affected testicle was found atrophied with lack of blood flow on color Doppler examination. The unaffected contralateral testicle remained within the normal size with good blood flow.

Conclusions

Prenatal diagnosis of unilateral testicular torsion is a coincidental rare finding. Because the twisted testicle cannot be salvaged, induced delivery and prompt surgery are not recommended.

### Reproductive markers of testicular function and size during puberty in boys with and without a history of cryptorchidism [^1158yn2N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism (undescended testis, maldescensus testis) is a condition in which one or both testes fail to reach the normal position at the bottom of the scrotum. Congenital cryptorchidism is the most common congenital anomaly among newborn boys, and it has a prevalence at birth of 1.1% to 8.4% in boys with a birthweight over 2500 g. Some testes can descend spontaneously after birth, which mostly occurs before the age of 3 to 6 months. The prevalence of cryptorchidism both at 3 and 12 months of age is approximately 1%.

Cryptorchidism is associated with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors and an increased risk of infertility, due to an impaired spermatogenesis. The consequences of cryptorchidism on testicular endocrine development during puberty are still unclear. Orchiopexy between 6 and 12 months and 18 months at the latest is nowadays the recommended treatment for cryptorchidism.

### Society for endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^113x9aph]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Partial gonadal (testicular) dysgenesis can present with a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from clitoromegaly, to ambiguous genitalia or severe hypospadias. Müllerian structures may or may not be present, and testes of variable size and architecture are present along the path of descent. The biochemical profile is similar to complete gonadal dysgenesis, but generally less severe. If mild degrees of clitoromegaly in infancy are overlooked, a 46, XY child with partial gonadal dysgenesis may first present at puberty with progressive androgenization. Genetic analysis and associated features may be useful in defining the molecular aetiology of some forms of gonadal dysgenesis. 67 This group of conditions are also associated with a risk of tumour development, which may be related to the extent of androgenization of the external genitalia in the XY child. 68

### The testis: the unusual, the rare and the bizarre [^111MDEFv]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the preferred technique when imaging the scrotal contents. Although appearances of many of the more common abnormalities present the examiner with no diagnostic difficulty, the more unusual conditions may present a considerable challenge. Many normal variants, unusual and rare abnormalities may be instantly recognized once seen. The current review highlights the more unusual and rare conditions affecting the scrotal contents in order to allow the reader the opportunity to gain knowledge of their existence and to aid future interpretation of the difficult examination.

### Caring for individuals with a difference of sex development (DSD): a consensus statement [^113Pt1kY]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — Potential surgical options for patients with difference of sex development (DSD) describe gonadectomy or partial gonadectomy, defined as removal of all or part of the gonads, which may be testes, ovaries, streak gonads that do not have an obvious testicular or ovarian appearance, and/or ovotestes that contain both testicular and ovarian tissue. Potential positive effects may include reducing the risk of developing cancer of the gonad, which has an elevated risk in some DSD conditions, and preventing the development of undesired secondary sex characteristics by preventing production of sex hormones, for example testosterone production in someone who identifies as female. Potential negative effects may include infertility if fertility potential is initially present.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: testicular torsion [^112aMqbU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of testicular torsion, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that occurs with rotation of the testicle along its supporting ligaments leading to obstruction of vascular flow. A key risk factor is the presence of a bell-clapper deformity. The most common population affected includes children in a bimodal distribution with the most cases occurring in the first year of life and between 12 and 18 years, although cases do occur in adults. Acute, severe, unilateral scrotal pain is the most common presenting symptom. Nausea and vomiting are common, but the presence or absence of a cremasteric reflex is not a reliable indicator of disease. The TWIST score may assist with clinical decision making in patients presenting with acute testicular pain but should not be used in isolation. If torsion is suspected or confirmed, consultation with the urology specialist should not be delayed, as outcomes are time sensitive. Ultrasound can be used for diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent urology consultation for surgical exploration and detorsion, as well as symptomatic therapy in the ED. Manual detorsion can be attempted in the ED while awaiting transfer or consultation.

Conclusions

An understanding of testicular torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### Does the contralateral testicular volume decide the need for diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of unilateral impalpable undescended testis? [^116idyAd]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Undescended testis or cryptorchidism is considered the most common congenital genito-urinary abnormality faced in male neonates with an incidence of 3% in full-term babies and increasing up to 30% in preterm males. However, this incidence declines to about 1% by the age of 3 months as it descends to its normal position in about 80% of cases. Only 20% of undescended testis is impalpable being either vanishing due to an intra-uterine accident, agenetic, intra-abdominal, or inguinal with different degrees of dysplasia and atrophy.

The gold standard method for a definitive diagnosis and management of impalpable undescended testis is laparoscopy and according to its findings; the procedure is planned whether nothing in case of vanishing or agenetic testis, inguinal exploration in case the vas and vessels are found passing through the deep inguinal ring (DIR) or traction, Fowler-Stevens (FS) or one stage laparoscopic assisted orchiopexy in case of the intra-abdominal testis.

The size of the contralateral testis has been used to predict the condition of its contralateral nonpalpable one while being explored by laparoscopy by many researchers. Ultrasound (US) is considered by many surgeons as being an accurate, reproducible, and objective in situ tool for the assessment of testicular dimensions and volume and in many studies, it can guide the initial surgical approach. However, the work aimed to assess the accuracy of the three-dimensional size as well as the volume of a normal testis as measured by ultrasonography in predicting the status of its contralateral nonpalpable counterpart; hence, helping in parent counselling preoperatively.

Testicular cancer — testis-sparing surgery selection and intraoperative planning: TSS (or partial orchiectomy) can be considered in men with a high-likelihood of harboring a benign testicular tumor or in men with an anatomically or functionally solitary testis who desire to preserve hormone and fertility function, and approximately 50–80% of non-palpable masses < 2 cm are benign lesions; men with small, non-palpable testicular masses who meet these criteria may consider TSS with frozen-section, and utilizing a pathologist experienced in the histologic assessment of GCT is recommended, and the decision regarding whether the testicle should be removed in its entirety if the diagnosis of a testicular cancer is made or cannot be determined on frozen section should be determined prior to surgery.

Testicular ultrasound is typically the first-line imaging examination in evaluating scrotal pathology. However, MR imaging can often provide valuable additional information, especially when ultrasound and/or clinical examinations are inconclusive. This is particularly evident when encountering testicular or paratesticular lesions, where accurate localization and characterization are paramount for management and prognosis. After reviewing normal scrotal anatomy as seen on MR imaging and offering a sample imaging protocol, the article describes specific indications for scrotal MR imaging and highlights imaging findings unique to various benign and malignant causes.

Testis-sparing surgery (TSS) for testicular masses — TSS, such as partial orchiectomy, can be considered in select patients with a testicular mass, with indications including synchronous bilateral germ cell tumors, a solitary testicle with a mass suspicious for germ cell tumor, or a functionally solitary testicle with adequate gonadal function with respect to androgen production or sperm production (eg, history of contralateral testicular atrophy). These patients should be counseled regarding the following: high risk of local recurrence with TSS; need for continued surveillance with testicular self-exam, physical exam by a physician, and/or ultrasound; role of adjuvant radiation to reduce the risk of local recurrence; impact of RT on sperm and testosterone production; and risk of testicular atrophy, need for testosterone replacement, and/or infertility. Principles of TSS specify that TSS should be performed through an inguinal approach, frozen section should be performed at the time of surgery by an experienced genitourinary pathologist, and radical orchiectomy in the setting of a normal contralateral testicle is recommended if biopsy shows testicular cancer is present or there is suspicion of cancer.

### UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development [^113McrQZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

If the appearance of the external genitalia is sufficiently ambiguous to render sex assignment impossible or the phenotype is not consistent with prenatal genetic tests, then de facto, extensive investigation is required. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer, and prior to presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of genital anomalies may be as high as one in 300 birthsbut the birth prevalence of complex anomalies that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as one in 5000 births.

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear on surgical exploration. These external features can be individually scored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinization score (EMS; Fig. 1). Routine systematic examination of 423 consecutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412 (98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only 1 of 423 had an EMS of < 11. In boys with genital anomalies, a chromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% of those with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadias and 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studies performed a decade ago revealed a likely cause in 31% of cases. With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it is unclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.

Testicular torsion

Usually colour and power Doppler US are sufficient to diagnose testicular torsion, with CEUS kept to confirm vascularity absence (Fig. 10) in difficult cases, such as in adolescents with small testes where colour Doppler information is suboptimal. Altogether, however, CEUS has not proved to add information in studying complete testicular torsion. Nevertheless, in chronic (initially missed) torsion, CEUS can detect peritesticular increased vascularity, while in incomplete torsion it reveals enhancement discrepancy between normal and abnormal testicle. It can also help in intermittent torsion, with normal or increased flow. In such cases differentiation from orchitis may be needed. It can be difficult to differentiate a segmental infarct with a rounded configuration from a poorly vascularised tumour. CEUS can help in this task, allowing a more confident diagnosis, compared with grey-scale and colour Doppler.

### Natural history of testicular size in boys with varicoceles [^116FMwvU]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Testicular size is commonly used as a proxy for future fertility in adolescent boys diagnosed with varicoceles. Surgery is often performed based on a 15–20% reduction in volume of the ipsilateral testicle when compared to the unaffected side. Recent European Association of Urology guidelines, however, have highlighted the risk of overtreatment. Data on the natural progression of testicular size discrepancy are limited in this population. To evaluate the role of a non-surgical approach, the present study reports on testicular size progression in 35 boys with left-sided varicoceles managed with observation alone.

Methods

In the present study, 103 consecutive boys who were seen for varicocele were retrospectively evaluated; the 35 who were seen for at least three sequential visits by the same pediatric urologist for a unilateral left varicocele were selected. In the present practice, surgical management of varicoceles in teens is offered, but not recommended unless surgery is being performed for another reason (3/103). The Prader orchidometric testicular volumes that were documented for all visits were recorded and the volume of the left testicle as a percentage of the right was calculated. This analysis was performed for the entire population, and subgroup analysis was conducted for boys with a Grade 3 varicocele, with > 10% asymmetry at diagnosis, and by dividing the population into prepubertal and pubertal age groups. Boys with bilateral varicoceles, concurrent testicular masses, or volumes recorded by a nurse practitioner were excluded from the study.

Results

The mean left testicular volume in the population was found to measure 96%, 95% and 96% of the right at the first, second and third visit (median interval was 2.0 years), respectively. Among the 26 boys seen for a fourth visit (median 3.3 years) and the 15 seen for a fifth visit (median 4.3 years), the mean left testicular volumes were 98% and 97% of the right at diagnosis and 97% at both the fourth and fifth visits (Figure). Likewise, no differences were seen after dividing the population into prepubertal (9–11 years, n = 9) and pubertal (12–14 years, n = 26) groups. Among the 13 (37%) boys with a Grade 3 varicocele at presentation, the left testicular volume was 95% (SD 11.4) of the right and remained unchanged by the third visit (96%, P = 0.69). In addition, among the 11 boys (31%) with greater than 10% size difference at the first visit, the left testicle measured 82% of the right (SD 5.3) at diagnosis and increased to 92% (SD 6.3) by the third visit (P < 0.001).

Discussion

In the 35 boys observed over a median of 2.0 years or three consecutive visits, there was no worsening of testicular asymmetry. This finding is consistent with some previous observational data on pediatric varicoceles, but carries the advantages of a narrower age range and longitudinal follow-up in all patients. At the same time, these results differ from other studies that show no improvement or worsening of asymmetry during follow-up. This difference is attributed to the inherent characteristics of the present study population and the choice of orchidometer for measurement. The present data have the advantage of excluding selection bias. Recognizing that this study is a retrospective, single-operator study with a small sample size, prospective, randomized trials are recommended to weigh surgery vs observation in adolescent varicocele patients.

Conclusions

No progression in atrophy/hypotrophy of the left testis was found in a series of 35 consecutive patients who were followed non-surgically for left-sided varicocele. Our data thus support observation as management for childhood varicocele in younger teens.

### Testis development and fertility potential in boys with Klinefelter syndrome [^115Knnsb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the leading genetic cause of primary hypogonadism and infertility in men. The clinical phenotype has expanded beyond the original description of infertility, small testes, and gynecomastia. Animal models, epidemiologic studies, and clinical research of male subjects with KS throughout the lifespan have allowed the better characterization of the variable phenotype of this condition. This review provides an overview on what is known of the epidemiology, clinical features, and pathophysiology of KS, followed by a more focused discussion of testicular development and the clinical management of hypogonadism and fertility in boys and men with KS.

### Testosterone (Testopel) [^114EN95y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MALES

Androgens are indicated for replacement therapy in conditions
associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.

a. Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired)
- testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion,
orchitis, vanishing testes syndrome; or orchiectomy.

b. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or
acquired) - gonadotropic LHRH deficiency, or pituitary
- hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation.

If the above conditions occur prior to puberty, androgen
replacement therapy will be needed during the adolescent years for
development of secondary sex characteristics. Prolonged androgen
treatment will be required to maintain sexual characteristics in these
and other males who develop testosterone deficiency after puberty.

Safety and efficacy of TESTOPEL®(testosterone pellets) in men with "age-related hypogonadism" (also referred to as "late-onset hypogonadism") have not been established.

c. Androgens may be used to stimulate puberty in
carefully selected males with clearly delayed puberty. These
patients usually have a familial pattern of delayed puberty that is
not secondary to a pathological disorder; puberty is expected to
occur spontaneously at a relatively late date. Brief treatment with
conservative doses may occasionally be justified in these patients
if they do not respond to psychological support. The potential
adverse effect on bone maturation should be discussed with the
patient and parents prior to androgen administration. An x-ray of
the hand and wrist to determine bone age should be taken every 6
months to assess the effect of treatment on epiphyseal centers (see WARNINGS).

### Undescended testis and torsion: is the risk understated? [^116xH2j2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT) is seen in 3% to 5% of all newborn boys. Complications such as infertility and malignant transformation have been well documented in UDT. However, torsion of a UDT can also occur and the diagnosis is often missed or delayed, leading to loss of testis. This event may occur even before the currently recommended age for surgery, which is at 6–9 months. We present a case series of six children with torsion of undescended testes and their subsequent diagnosis and management. The risk of torsion of UDT is understated. Paediatricians should be educated about this complication and torsion should be included in the differential diagnosis when a boy with an empty scrotum presents with acute abdomen or red and tender swelling in the groin, as early detection and intervention can help salvage the testes.

### Does the contralateral testicular volume decide the need for diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of unilateral impalpable undescended testis? [^112nTj2B]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The size of the contralateral testis has been used by many authors in predicting the condition of its contralateral nonpalpable counterpart. Testicular hypertrophy in cases of absent or small-sized contralateral testis was first described by Laron and Zilka in 1969. Testicular volumes can be measured using different types of orchidometers or calipers. Prader's orchidometer is the most widely used; nevertheless, US measurements of testicular volume are highly accurate, reproducible, and considered by many authors the best tool for measuring the testicular volume.

Seventy-six patients were included in our study in two consecutive years with an average age ranging between 6 months and 4 years in comparison to a study conducted by Shalaby et al. who included only 40 patients within 2 years with an age ranging between one and 6 years old. The testicular volume in that study ranged from 0.94 to 6.33, with a mean of 3.12 ± 1.41 cm³. The difference compared to ours may be attributed to higher age groups being included in that study.

The result of laparoscopic exploration revealed 47% with absent testis and 53% with their testis present. This is approximately similar to the findings in other related studies as shown by AbdElsalam et al. who found the testis in about 57.5% of their studied patients and an absent testis in the remaining 42.5%.

The testicular volume as measured by US was significantly higher in those patients who had been found to have an absent testis (blind ending vas and vessels) or an excised atrophied canalicular remnant than in those who had a testis either intra-abdominal or passing into the inguinal canal. This confirms the concept of the importance of testicular hypertrophy in predicting the condition of its contralateral one as concluded also by Boehm et al. in their study.

The cut-off point of volume of normal testis in our study was ≤ 0.674 cm; this volume differs greatly from other studies as concluded by Hodhod et al. in their study in which the cut-off point was > 2 ml. However, in this study, the authors used Takihara orchidometer for measuring the testicular volume. Although this orchidometer is useful in comparing different testicular sizes; nevertheless, the absolute values obtained are overestimated in many clinical conditions.

### Is the comparison of a left varicocele testis to its contralateral normal testis sufficient in determining its well-being? [^115HV6xr]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a size difference between a left testis involved with a varicocele and the contralateral normal testis is sufficient in its size assessment.

Methods

We reviewed all pediatric scrotal ultrasounds at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2008. Sonographic testicular measurements were recorded for patients with clinically diagnosed left varicocele (n = 81 for "varicocele" group) and for patients with no specific pathologic findings (n = 184 for "normal" group). We first compared the sizes between left and right testes for all patients, then between the "varicocele" group and the "normal" group separately for left and right.

Results

There were no significant size differences between left and right testes for the "normal" group, whereas the left was significantly smaller than the contralateral right for the "varicocele" group (P = 0.0048 for length; P = 0.012 for volume) for all ages. For boys 16 years or older, both the left and contralateral right testes of "varicocele" boys were smaller than those of "normal" boys, adjusting for age (P for left = .026 for length and .059 for volume; for right P = 0.033 for length and .031 for volume).

Conclusion

Our study confirms that the left testis in boys with varicocele is most often smaller than the contralateral right testis no matter the age. Compared with normal boys in late adolescence, the contralateral right testis is smaller in boys with varicocele.

Testicular cancer — initial workup states that if cancer is considered, a transscrotal ultrasound with Doppler should be performed to confirm a mass, determine intra- versus extratesticular location, and explore the contralateral testis; if ultrasound shows a mass suspicious for malignancy, a radical inguinal orchiectomy is generally performed to make a diagnosis. Testis-sparing surgery (TSS) may be considered in select patients, including synchronous bilateral tumors, a solitary testicle with a mass suspicious for GCT, or a functionally solitary testicle with adequate gonadal function. Transscrotal biopsies of the testes should not be performed, and a thorough history and physical examination should be performed. Serum tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) need to be assessed both before and after orchiectomy, with elevated levels followed up with repeated tests to allow for precise staging. Measuring baseline levels of gonadal function can also be considered, and in advanced disease, systemic therapy may be initiated if there is an unequivocable diagnosis of GCT with marker elevation or after percutaneous biopsy of a metastatic site.

### Surgery for no palpable testis before the age of one year: a risk for the testis? [^1138zcaY]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgery for undescended testis is now commonly recommended before the age of one year. However, the risk of testicular atrophy or miss location after surgery at a young age has not been clearly evaluated.

Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of testicular atrophy after surgery for non-palpable testis before the age of one year.

Materials

Fifty-five patients operated between 2005 and 2014 for non-palpable testes were reviewed for clinical and ultrasound (US) evaluation. Median follow-up after surgery was of 68.5 months (range 26–130 months). The median age at surgery was of months (5–12 months). Eight patients (14.5%) had bilateral non-palpable testis; thus, 63 testes were evaluated. At surgery, 38 (60%) testes were located in the high inguinal canal; 25 (40%), in the abdominal cavity. Orchiopexy was performed with preservation of the testicular vessels for 58 testes. Fowler-Stephens (FS) procedure was performed for 5 testes. Testicular location was clinically evaluated, and testicular volume was measured using a standard sonogram technique in our pediatric radiology department. Ratio comparing the volume of the descended testis to the spontaneously scrotal located testis was calculated in unilateral forms.

Results

After surgery, testes had scrotal location in 62 cases and inguinal location in one case. Seven cases of atrophy were confirmed after US control (11%), more frequently (odds ratio, OR 11.68 [1.9–72.5]) in abdominal testis (24%) than in inguinal testis (2.6%). Atrophy testicular was more frequent with FS technique (OR 7.1 [1.3–40.1]), but the population was weak (N = 5). Median volume ratio for unilateral form was 0.88 [0–1.8]; 14 patients presented a ratio greater than 1.

Discussion

The influence of the young age at surgery and the risk of post operative testicular atrophy had not been clearly evaluated. The term of 'no palpable testis' supports an heterogeneous group mixing abdominal and extra-abdominal testis sharing a uniform clinical presentation. Our rate of atrophy in the group of abdominal testes (24%) and inguinal testes (2.6%) is similar to the literature, which concerns older patients. The long-term sonogram assessment demonstrated a good development of the testis after surgery, especially in inguinal cases.

Conclusion

Surgery for no palpable testis before the age of one year does not lead to a superior risk of testicular atrophy compared with surgery at an older age and allows a good development of the testis.

### Efficacy of topical testosterone in management of scrotal hypoplasia and agenesis [^115xfgen]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Scrotal hypoplasia or agenesis may posses difficulty during orchidopexy or end with social anxiety around excessively small scrotal size when compared to peers, and where there may be concerns regarding the future sexual life.

Objective

Any conservative modality applicable to ameliorate scrotal underdevelopment partially or completely will be useful either solely or before reconstructive surgery.

Study Design

Seventeen child (3–8 years) were diagnosed with bilateral scrotal hypoplasia (SH) in 5 unilateral in 7, bilateral scrotal agenesis (SA) diagnosed in 4 cases, and unilateral in one. Testicles are either undescended, ectopic, or normal. All cases managed by Testogel 1% topical testosterone for 4 weeks. Clinical assessment by measurements of the scrotal skin surface area (scrotal length multiplied by width) and scrotal corrugations counting. Inguinal and renal ultrasound done for all cases and karyotyping for cases of agenesis and cases with bilateral undescended testicles. Total and free testosterone, LH, FSH and AMH hormones were assisted before treatment, weekly and one week after therapy. Data analyzed and evaluated, difference of means used to test for statistically significant differences between scores of scrotal development.

Results

Free and total testosterone elevated in the 1st week of treatment, but restored to normal or higher levels in 60% of cases at the 2nd week. Satisfactory response (Increasing numbers of scrotal rugae or scrotal surface area by 30–50% above the pretreatment status) obtained in 85% and 60% of unilateral and bilateral SH, but only a partial response (10–20% increase) was gained in 40% of cases with agenesis. No major adverse effect was appreciated.

Discussion

Response of some cases of SH to topical testosterone indicates presence of remnants of labioscrotal folds with testosterone receptors (Bell et al., 1971) [1]. Testosterone replacement therapy can improve the signs and well-being of a hypogonadal male by restoring serum testosterone concentrations to physiologic levels. In this study the mean average testosterone concentration one week after application of testogel was 13.47 ± 2.45 and 12.12 ± 2.5 within 2nd, 4th week, and after cessation of treatment. Anti-Mullerian hormone is significantly low in 12 cases; mainly in cases of SA (P-value < 0.001).

Conclusion

Short term topical testosterone proved to be effective in a considerable percentage of cases of either bilateral or unilateral scrotal hypoplasia; with a subsequent increase in scrotal surface area and number of rugae, it may substitutes the indication for surgical reconstruction. Long term follow up is a limitation of this study.

### Varicoceles in the pediatric and adolescent population: threat to future fertility? [^1152y6ib]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Determining the effect of varicoceles on future fertility is challenging owing to multiple issues in children/adolescents, including: limitations in obtaining and interpreting semen analyses; potential for unequal differential testicular growth during puberty regardless of varicocele presence; and the potential for a lengthy interval between surgical intervention for varicocele in adolescence and attempts at paternity. This review presents a summary and evaluation of the available evidence relating to future fertility among children and adolescents with varicoceles. Data relating to proxy fertility measures in children/adolescents, including testicular size asymmetry and semen analysis abnormalities, demonstrate that these proxy measures are imperfect predictors of future fertility. Two large, recently published series of adolescents undergoing varicocele treatment showed conflicting paternity outcomes. Pediatric and adolescent varicocele will remain a clinical conundrum, subject to both over- and under-treatment, until more definitive prospective data are available.

### Intratesticular varicoceles: are they significant? [^113GSCsy]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Varicoceles occur in 15% of adult and adolescent males and are generally considered to be an extratesticular phenomenon. However, an intratesticular component has been reported in up to 2% of adult and 2% of adolescent varicoceles. We sought to determine the incidence of intratesticular varicoceles (ITV) in adolescents in our practice, its significance, associated findings and response to treatment.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 684 adolescent males who were diagnosed with varicoceles and had at least one Doppler ultrasound (DUS) prior to any surgery to identify those with an intratesticular component. Testicular volumes, maximum vein diameter (MVD) and peak retrograde flow (PRF) were determined by DUS and recorded.

Results

A total of 6 (0.9%) patients were found to have an intratesticular component with a mean PRF of 43.7 cm/s, mean MVD of 3.3 mm and mean asymmetry of 20%. Mean PRF, MVD, and asymmetry of those without an intratesticular component who underwent surgery was 44.8 cm/s, 2.9 mm, and 21.8%, respectively (PNS for all parameters). Four of the 6 patients had 2 or more DUS, and all 4 had worsening testicular asymmetry and PRF over time. Five patients underwent laparoscopic varicocelectomy and all five had catch-up testicular growth. One patient refused surgical repair and has had subsequent worsening testicular asymmetry and softening of the testicle.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that adolescents who present with an intratesticular varicocele in association with testicular asymmetry will develop worse asymmetry over time. Therefore, adolescents with intratesticular varicoceles and initial asymmetry should be scheduled for surgery rather than followed.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^115GBXcH]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency — men desiring fertility: Men who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Men interested in preserving fertility should undergo testicular exam to evaluate testicular size, consistency, and descent and have serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measured to assess reproductive status. Elevated FSH levels in the setting of testosterone deficiency indicate impaired spermatogenesis and clinicians should consider fertility testing, such as semen analysis. Men with severe oligospermia (sperm concentration < 5 million per mL) or non-obstructive azoospermia should be offered reproductive genetics testing consisting of karyotype testing and Y-chromosome analysis for microdeletions, and the management of such patients is best conducted by a reproductive urologist.

Cryptorchidism — testicular descent timing and epidemiology by gestational age: At approximately 22–25 weeks of gestation, the testes are located at the internal ring, and the inguinoscrotal phase occurs between 25–30 weeks; the prevalence of cryptorchidism is 1–3% in full-term and 15–30% in premature male infants, descent is unlikely after six months of corrected age, and the prevalence in infants < 900 g is approximately 100%; obtaining gestational age is thus critical to timely surgical referral for persistent undescended testes.

Physical examination technique and referral for nonpalpable testis are specified. Once the testis is palpated, gently grasp it with the dominant hand and continue to sweep the testis toward the scrotum with the other hand. In palpable testes that can be manipulated into the scrotum, it is important to maintain the position of the testis in the scrotum for approximately 30 seconds in order to fatigue the cremaster muscle. This will allow differentiation of a retractile testis from a UDT. Release the testis, and if it remains in place, it is a retractile testis. If it immediately retracts to a prescrotal position, it is a UDT. The presence of compensatory hypertrophy (length greater than 2 cm in prepubertal young boys) is highly associated with monorchia. However, hypertrophy of the contralateral testis, if present, is neither perfectly sensitive nor specific for the presence of vanishing testis. Therefore, surgical exploration is indicated in all children with a nonpalpable testis. These children should be referred to a surgical specialist regardless of the size of the contralateral testis.

### ESPR uroradiology taskforce – imaging recommendations in paediatric uroradiology, part VIII: retrograde urethrography, imaging disorder of sexual development and imaging childhood testicular torsion [^111g7dPC]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Nuclear medicine studies and MRI with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging are methods that may theoretically be useful in testicular torsion; however, these methods are normally not readily available and will most often cause diagnostic delay, hence are not applicable in the acute setting.

Taking all aspects into account, the imaging algorithm for childhood testicular torsion (Fig. 3) is quite simple. In suspected testicular torsion (after the perinatal period), immediate surgical exploration is advocated when the clinical findings are highly suspicious. In equivocal cases, immediate US should be performed without diagnostic delay by an experienced ultrasonographer. MRI may be an option for complementing the assessment of differential diagnoses such as testicular tumour or undescended testes.

Fig. 3
Recommended imaging of suspected testicular torsion beyond the neonatal age

The algorithm in neonatal torsion (Fig. 4) is slightly different and more controversial. Because of the low prevalence of neonatal torsion there is practically no scientific evidence available regarding imaging and its role in the management of this condition. In neonatal torsion, the testicle is rarely salvageable, except in a few circumstances (e.g. partial torsion or if the torsion occurred during or just after birth and treatment was undertaken immediately). US examination followed by early surgical exploration has therefore become the most generally accepted approach for all cases with non-translucent scrotal swelling. In neonatal torsion, the testicle is often firm on palpation, with some bluish discolouration and lack of a cremasteric reflex. There may be some tenderness or a retracted testicle, but the patient is often asymptomatic. The US examination should be performed with a high-frequency linear transducer (12–18 MHz). The grey-scale findings are the most important because the colour Doppler assessment of a neonatal testicle can be very difficult even when the perfusion is normal. If US demonstrates a unilateral necrotic testis, it may be removed with elective surgery and a contralateral orchidopexy performed simultaneously. If there is bilateral involvement (with reportedly one-third being asynchronous), an immediate exploration is considered justified giving the risk of complete anorchia. In the rare occasion of unilateral disease with US signs of possible viable tissue, based on echogenicity and perfusion of the affected testicle, emergency surgery is also performed. Thus, immediate US should be performed when a neonate presents with non-translucent scrotal swelling, with stratification of further management depending on the US findings.

### Contemporary review of testicular torsion: new concepts, emerging technologies and potential therapeutics [^1156YG1e]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is one of the few emergencies in pediatric urology which requires an accurate and timely diagnosis in order to avoid testis loss. It is not an uncommon event affecting a young male population. In fact, testicular torsion is more common than testicular tumors for this same age group, yet testicular torsion has not been given the public attention it deserves as a male health risk. In this review we highlight the new information published over the past four years regarding testicular torsion. We will discuss a variety of topics associated with torsion including: medical legal issues, etiology and genetics, imaging diagnostics, innovative surgical techniques, management controversies, fertility, and new drug therapies.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^115eqgbo]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Testicular cancer — workup and initial management include imaging, surgical approach, biopsy avoidance, examination, tumor markers, endocrine assessment, and criteria for non-surgical initiation of therapy. If testicular cancer is being considered as a possibility, then a transscrotal ultrasound with Doppler should be performed. Testicular ultrasound can confirm the presence of a testicular mass, determine whether a mass is intra- or extratesticular, and explore the contralateral testis. If the ultrasound findings show a mass suspicious for malignancy, then a radical inguinal orchiectomy is generally performed to make a diagnosis. Testis-sparing surgery (TSS) (ie, partial orchiectomy) may be considered in select patients, and unique clinical settings that warrant consideration for TSS include synchronous bilateral tumors, a solitary testicle with a mass suspicious for GCT, or a functionally solitary testicle with adequate gonadal function with respect to androgen production or sperm production (eg, history of contralateral testicular atrophy). Transscrotal biopsies of the testes should not be performed because violating the scrotum increases the risk of local or atypical regional recurrence and can complicate management. In addition, a thorough history and physical examination should be performed. Serum tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) also need to be assessed both before and after orchiectomy as they are used for prognosis and staging, and elevated levels of beta-hCG, LDH, or AFP should be followed up with repeated tests to allow for precise staging. Given the higher rates of hypogonadism in the testicular cancer population, measuring baseline levels of gonadal function can also be considered. It should be noted that in cases of advanced disease, systemic therapy may be initiated if there is an unequivocable diagnosis of GCT with marker elevation or after percutaneous biopsy of a metastatic site.

Scrotal ultrasound examination specifications — The written or electronic request for scrotal ultrasound should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination and allow for the proper performance and interpretation of the examination, and documentation that satisfies medical necessity includes 1) signs and symptoms and/or 2) relevant history (including known diagnoses). The request for the examination must be originated by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider, and the accompanying clinical information should be provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider familiar with the patient's clinical problem or question and consistent with the state scope of practice requirements. For image acquisition, the presence of two testes should be documented on a single transverse, coronal, or coronal oblique image; a cine loop survey scan taken in both longitudinal and transverse projections may be obtained and stored with the rest of the study when technically feasible; the testes should be evaluated in at least two planes, longitudinal and transverse; transverse images should be obtained in the superior, mid, and inferior portions of the testes; longitudinal views should be obtained centrally as well as medially and laterally; and each testis should be evaluated in its entirety with testicular volumes provided using the Lambert formula (length × width × height × 0.71).

### Testosterone (testim) [^111RUwZv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

TESTIM is contraindicated in pregnant women. Testosterone is teratogenic and may cause fetal harm based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. In animal development studies, exposure to testosterone in utero resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring and structural impairments of reproductive tissues in female and male offspring. These studies did not meet current standards for nonclinical development toxicity studies.

Data

Animal Data

In developmental studies conducted in rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus monkeys, pregnant animals received intramuscular injection of testosterone during the period of organogenesis. Testosterone treatment at doses that were comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring. Structural impairments observed in females included increased anogenital distance, phallus development, empty scrotum, no external vagina, intrauterine growth retardation, reduced ovarian reserve, and increased ovarian follicular recruitment. Structural impairments seen in male offspring included increased testicular weight, larger seminal tubular lumen diameter, and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen. Increased pituitary weight was seen in both sexes.

Testosterone exposure in utero also resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring. Hypertension was observed in pregnant female rats and their offspring exposed to doses approximately twice those used for testosterone replacement therapy.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

TESTIM is not indicated for use in females.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

During treatment with large doses of exogenous androgens, including TESTIM, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], possible leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. Reduced fertility is observed in some men taking testosterone replacement therapy. Testicular atrophy, subfertility, and infertility have also been reported in men who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. With either type of use, the impact on fertility may be irreversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TESTIM in pediatric patients less than 18 years old have not been established. Improper use may result in acceleration of bone age and premature closure of epiphyses.

8.5 Geriatric Use

There is insufficient long-term safety data in geriatric patients to assess the potentially increased risks of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
