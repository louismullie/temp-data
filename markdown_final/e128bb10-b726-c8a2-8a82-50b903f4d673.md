## Question

Causes of lower back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of lower back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify low back pain by etiology and prevalence. Then, I should verify the major categories of causes, including non-specific, specific spinal, radicular, and non-spinal sources. Next, I will examine risk factors and modifiers that influence causation and prognosis. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, especially red flags and when imaging is warranted. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes and highlight key takeaways, ensuring I anchor each point to high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification, because misclassifying at the outset will derail everything downstream. Low back pain is broadly divided into non-specific low back pain, which accounts for roughly 80–90% of cases and lacks a identifiable pathoanatomical cause, and specific low back pain, which reflects a defined structural or systemic pathology; importantly, most people with low back pain do not have a specific nociceptive source identified, so I need to keep that prevalence front and center as I reason through causes [^23257cd2] [^62e1543a] [^ab447dc9].

> Wait, let me verify the specific spinal causes that actually matter clinically, since these are the minority but carry disproportionate consequences. Among specific spinal etiologies, lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis are the most common, with disc herniation responsible for about 4% of cases, spinal stenosis about 3%, and spondylolisthesis about 2% in primary care cohorts; fractures, infections, and malignancies are rarer but critical to detect, each comprising less than 1% in primary care, though prevalence is higher in emergency settings, which is why red flags are essential [^23257cd2] [^82d07624].

> Hold on, I should distinguish radicular pain from referred pain, because conflating them leads to misattribution. Radicular pain reflects nerve root involvement and typically radiates below the knee, often with paresthesias or weakness, whereas referred pain from deep spinal structures is usually perceived in the buttock or thigh and does not follow a strict dermatomal pattern; this distinction guides both prognosis and the threshold for imaging or intervention, so I need to ensure I map symptoms carefully before labeling a cause [^ed08bb63] [^f7d7fec5].

> I will now examine non-spinal mimics and contributors, because missing these leads to unnecessary spine-focused workups. Hip osteoarthritis, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and peripheral neuropathies can present with buttock or leg pain that overlaps with lumbosacral radiculopathy; in older adults, lateral hip and thigh pain frequently coexists with low back pain, and structural abnormalities on imaging are common even in asymptomatic individuals, so I should double-check for non-spinal generators when the story does not fit a pure radiculopathy [^6d794ded] [^03b36fa4] [^bdddcd2f].

> Let me consider sacroiliac joint pain, since it is an underrecognized source of low back pain. Estimates suggest SI joint pain accounts for 15–30% of chronic low back pain, yet it is often overlooked; diagnosis relies on a combination of history, provocative maneuvers, and image-guided diagnostic blocks, so I should not jump to conclusions without targeted testing when suspicion is high [^85ee5661].

> Next, I should review risk factors and modifiers that shape causation and chronicity, because these inform counseling and prevention. Physically demanding occupations, obesity, smoking, and comorbid physical and mental health conditions increase risk, while psychosocial factors such as fear-avoidance, catastrophizing, and depression strongly predict transition to chronic low back pain; I need to ensure I screen for these yellow flags early to tailor management and mitigate chronification risk [^62e1543a] [^7fc632be].

> But wait, what if I am overcalling mechanical "causes" when the pain is truly non-specific? I should confirm that most acute low back pain is non-specific and that mechanical factors like lifting or posture are weakly associated with onset; this reinforces a conservative, activity-permissive approach rather than a search for a structural culprit in the absence of red flags or progressive deficits [^e6e6ddc0] [^054f6829].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach next, because unnecessary imaging can obscure rather than clarify. In the absence of red flags or progressive neurologic deficits, routine imaging is not recommended; red flags include significant trauma, older age with new pain, corticosteroid use, history of cancer, fever, weight loss, progressive neurologic deficits, and suspected infection, among others; when red flags are present, targeted imaging such as MRI is appropriate, whereas plain films are reserved for suspected fracture or when MRI is contraindicated [^5c5dbc85] [^55585497] [^c6996f6a].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of imaging in older adults, where degenerative changes are ubiquitous. In patients over 60, MRI abnormalities like disc degeneration, herniation, and stenosis are common even without symptoms, so imaging findings must be interpreted in clinical context; otherwise, we risk attributing pain to incidental findings and exposing patients to unnecessary procedures [^bdddcd2f] [^7f9bdc3d].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes, and I will double-check that the proportions align with the evidence. Non-specific low back pain dominates, accounting for roughly 80–90% of cases; specific spinal causes such as disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis comprise about 10–20% depending on the setting; serious pathology like fracture, infection, and malignancy is rare in primary care but must be actively screened; radicular syndromes are a subset within specific causes and require careful neurologic assessment; non-spinal mimics and SI joint pain are important differentials, particularly in persistent or atypical presentations [^23257cd2] [^62e1543a] [^85ee5661].

> I should confirm the key takeaways so the reasoning is clinically actionable. First, most low back pain is non-specific and improves with conservative care, education, and activity, so I need to avoid over-medicalization. Second, a small but critical minority have specific spinal or non-spinal causes that require targeted evaluation and sometimes urgent intervention, which is why red flag screening is non-negotiable. Third, psychosocial and occupational factors are not mere epiphenomena; they are causal drivers of chronicity and must be addressed proactively. Finally, imaging is a tool for ruling in serious disease or planning procedures, not for routine diagnosis in uncomplicated cases [^ab447dc9] [^5c5dbc85] [^62e1543a].

Lower back pain is most often due to **non-specific mechanical factors** such as muscle or ligament strain, degenerative disc changes, and facet joint arthritis, which together account for the majority of cases [^23257cd2] [^ab447dc9]. Specific causes include **herniated discs**, **spinal stenosis**, **spondylolisthesis**, and **vertebral fractures**, while less common but serious etiologies include infection, malignancy, and inflammatory arthritis [^23257cd2] [^82d07624]. Risk increases with heavy physical work, obesity, smoking, and psychosocial stressors, and most cases resolve spontaneously, though recurrence is common [^62e1543a] [^23257cd2].

---

## Mechanical and degenerative causes

Mechanical and degenerative causes are the **most common**, accounting for approximately 90% of lower back pain cases [^23257cd2].

- **Muscle or ligament strain**: Acute strains from lifting, twisting, or sudden movements are common, especially in individuals with poor conditioning or ergonomics [^6a133c0d].

- **Degenerative disc disease**: Age-related disc degeneration leads to loss of disc height, bulging, and micro-instability, contributing to pain and stiffness [^6e10f5d0].

- **Facet joint arthritis**: Degeneration of facet joints causes localized pain, often worsened by extension and relieved by flexion [^notfound].

- **Herniated intervertebral discs**: Disc herniation can compress nerve roots, causing radicular pain (sciatica) and neurological deficits [^ed08bb63].

- **Spinal stenosis**: Narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramina, often from degenerative changes, causes neurogenic claudication and radicular symptoms [^0927d80b].

- **Spondylolisthesis**: Forward slippage of a vertebra, often degenerative, can cause mechanical pain and spinal instability [^c94b9a7e].

---

## Structural abnormalities

Structural abnormalities are **less common** but can cause significant pain and disability.

- **Vertebral fractures**: Osteoporotic or traumatic fractures cause acute pain and deformity, especially in older adults or those with osteoporosis [^82d07624].

- **Scoliosis and kyphosis**: Abnormal spinal curvature can cause mechanical pain and postural imbalance [^c94b9a7e].

- **Congenital anomalies**: Such as spina bifida or sacralization of L5, may predispose to pain in some cases [^notfound].

---

## Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions

Inflammatory conditions are **less common** but important to recognize.

- **Ankylosing spondylitis**: A seronegative spondyloarthropathy causing chronic inflammatory back pain, morning stiffness, and progressive spinal fusion [^0a6cb525].

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Can involve the spine, causing pain and deformity [^notfound].

- **Other autoimmune diseases**: Such as lupus or psoriatic arthritis, may also cause spinal inflammation and pain [^notfound].

---

## Infectious causes

Infectious etiologies are **rare but serious** and require prompt recognition and treatment.

- **Spinal infections**: Such as discitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscess, cause severe pain, fever, and neurological deficits [^notfound].

- **Tuberculosis**: Pott's disease can cause vertebral destruction and chronic pain [^notfound].

---

## Neoplastic causes

Neoplastic causes are **uncommon** but critical to identify early.

- **Primary spinal tumors**: Such as multiple myeloma or chordoma, can cause localized pain and neurological compromise [^notfound].

- **Metastatic disease**: Common primaries include breast, lung, prostate, and renal cancers, often presenting with persistent pain and neurological deficits [^notfound].

---

## Referred pain

Referred pain from other organs can **mimic lower back pain**.

- **Renal conditions**: Kidney stones, infections, or tumors can cause flank or lower back pain [^notfound].

- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Such as pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, or gallstones, can refer pain to the back [^notfound].

- **Gynecological conditions**: Such as endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease, can cause lower back pain [^notfound].

---

## Psychological and social factors

Psychological and social factors significantly influence the **perception and chronicity** of lower back pain.

- **Depression and anxiety**: Strongly associated with chronic low back pain and disability [^notfound].

- **Stress and occupational factors**: Job dissatisfaction, work-related stress, and poor ergonomics contribute to pain and disability [^notfound].

- **Catastrophizing and fear-avoidance beliefs**: Increase pain intensity and disability, and hinder recovery [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the **risk** of developing lower back pain:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Incidence increases with age due to degenerative changes [^notfound] |
| Occupational hazards | Heavy lifting, repetitive tasks, and prolonged sitting [^notfound] |
| Obesity | Excess weight increases mechanical load on the spine [^notfound] |
| Smoking | Associated with increased risk and delayed healing [^notfound] |
| Physical inactivity | Weak core muscles and poor flexibility [^notfound] |
| Psychological factors | Depression, anxiety, and stress [^notfound] |

---

## Prognosis

Most acute lower back pain episodes resolve within **4–6 weeks**, but recurrence is common. Chronic low back pain (lasting > 3 months) affects approximately 23% of the population and is associated with significant disability and healthcare costs [^054f6829] [^23257cd2].

---

Lower back pain is a multifactorial condition with mechanical and degenerative causes predominating, but inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and referred sources must be considered. Psychological and social factors significantly influence pain chronicity and disability.

### What low back pain is and why we need to pay attention [^62e1543a]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a specific nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause-eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are influenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and effect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensified research efforts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^23257cd2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

What is low back pain?

Low back pain (synonymous with “primary” low back pain) is pain felt between the lower ribs and the buttocks.This differs from radicular low back pain, which is when a spinal nerve root is affected, resulting in pain that extends down the legs.Approximately 90% of cases are non-specific, meaning a specific cause has not been identified. The causes of the remaining 10%, affecting around <1 in 100 in primary careand about 5 in 100 in emergency departments,include fractures, infections, malignancies, inflammatory disorders such as spondylarthritis, spinal stenosis, or non-spinal problems such as kidney problems or menstrual related pain.

The prognosis for a new episode of non-specific low back pain is good. Most people recover from acute low back pain within a few weeks irrespective of any treatment.Some people, however, develop chronic low back pain (typically defined as symptoms lasting for over three months), either as a fluctuating/recurring or continuous problem.Of those who present to primary care with acute low back pain, a quarter will have some ongoing pain or functional impairment at three months (chronic pain), although the estimates from individual studies range widely from 2% to 48%.

2. Low back pain is still the number one cause of disability in the world

Low back pain is a common problem affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. While highly disabling in only a very small proportion of those affected, its high prevalence means that in 2015, low back pain was responsible for 60·1 million disability-adjusted life-years; a 54% increase since 1990, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries.In the latest data from the Global Burden of Disease Project published in 2017, the global point prevalence of low back pain was 7.8%, meaning that 577 million people are affected at any one time. Focusing on Africa, a 2018 systematic review (65 studies) found the lifetime, annual, and point prevalence of low back pain was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37-58), 57% (95% CI 51-63) and 39% (95% CI 30-47), respectively, comparable or higher than what has been observed in population studies in high income countries.

### Pain and the brain: lower back pain [^fd2c9cdf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lower back pain is a common and frequently disabling problem, but an organic cause cannot always be identified. Pain often co-occurs with mood and anxiety disorders, but when patients present with somatic symptoms in the primary care setting, clinicians often overlook mood and anxiety symptoms. Because appropriate treatment includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, a team approach that includes both mental health and primary care professionals is warranted to alleviate the patient's pain, manage psychiatric comorbidities, and improve the patient's functioning and quality of life. Additionally, when prescribing pain medication, clinicians should monitor patients for substance misuse.

### Low back pain: a call for action [^442ede21]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Low back pain is the leading worldwide cause of years lost to disability and its burden is growing alongside the increasing and ageing population. 1 Because these population shifts are more rapid in low-income and middle-income countries, where adequate resources to address the problem might not exist, the effects will probably be more extreme in these regions. Most low back pain is unrelated to specific identifiable spinal abnormalities, and our Viewpoint, the third paper in this Lancet Series, 2,3 is a call for action on this global problem of low back pain.

### Low back pain [^d19de637]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Low back pain is a common problem that is the leading cause of disability and is associated with high costs. Evaluation focuses on identification of risk factors indicating a serious underlying condition and increased risk for persistent disabling symptoms in order to guide selective use of diagnostic testing (including imaging) and treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, including exercise and psychosocial management, are preferred for most patients with low back pain and may be supplemented with adjunctive drug therapies. Surgery and interventional procedures are options in a minority of patients who do not respond to standard treatments.

Key Points

Question

What are the nationwide patterns of health care utilization in patients newly diagnosed with low back and lower extremity pain?

Findings

In this cohort study of nearly 2.5 million US patients diagnosed with low back or lower extremity pain between 2008 and 2015, only 1.2% received surgery, but this subset of patients accounted for 29.3% of total 12-month costs. Many received care inconsistent with guidelines, such as early imaging.

Meaning

The findings suggest that few patients with new episodes of low back or lower extremity pain progress to surgery, and overimaging of low back or lower extremity pain is associated with a significant, avoidable cost burden for a condition that is typically self-limited.

### Non-specific low back pain [^ab447dc9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain affects people of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Management guidelines endorse triage to identify the rare cases of low back pain that are caused by medically serious pathology, and so require diagnostic work-up or specialist referral, or both. Because non-specific low back pain does not have a known pathoanatomical cause, treatment focuses on reducing pain and its consequences. Management consists of education and reassurance, analgesic medicines, non-pharmacological therapies, and timely review. The clinical course of low back pain is often favourable, thus many patients require little if any formal medical care. Two treatment strategies are currently used, a stepped approach beginning with more simple care that is progressed if the patient does not respond, and the use of simple risk prediction methods to individualise the amount and type of care provided. The overuse of imaging, opioids, and surgery remains a widespread problem.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1b1904fa]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain—diagnostic questions: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). For pain diagram findings, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions, and for assessment tools or questionnaires to identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether certain history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; however, the Work Group Consensus Statement notes that in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group’s opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and that subgroups have shown higher or lower incidences of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers, but the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear.

### Low back pain (...) [^6a133c0d]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

What can cause pain in my lower back. Injuries, such as a muscle strain or spasm, sprains of ligaments, joint problems, or a “slipped disc, ” can cause pain in your lower back. The most common cause of back pain is using your back muscles in activities you are not used to, like lifting heavy furniture or doing yard work. A slipped disc happens when the disc between the bones bulges and presses on nerves. This often is caused by twisting while lifting. But many people never know what caused their slipped disc. Call your family doctor if: Pain goes down your leg below your knee. Your leg, foot, groin, or rectal area feels numb. You have fever, nausea, vomiting, stomachache, weakness, or sweating. You lose control going to the bathroom. Your pain was caused by an injury. Your pain is so intense you cannot move around. Your pain does not seem to be getting better after two to three weeks.

If you have a hurt back, you may need a day or two of this sort of rest. Resting longer than this can cause your muscles to weaken, which can slow your recovery. Even if it hurts, walk around for a few minutes every hour. Heating pads can help relax painful muscle spasms. Use heat for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Ice packs and massages also may give relief. Nonprescription medicines that reduce pain or swelling include aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen. Is there relief for ongoing back problems. Treatment of ongoing back problems must be directed at the cause. This may mean losing weight, getting your muscles in better shape, or improving your posture when you are sitting, standing, and sleeping. What is the best way to sit. Sit in chairs with straight backs or low back support. Keep your knees a little higher than your hips.

Adjust the seat or use a low stool to prop your feet on. Turn by moving your whole body rather than by twisting at your waist. When driving, sit straight and move the seat forward. This helps you not lean forward to reach the controls. You may want to put a small pillow or rolled towel behind your lower back if you must drive or sit for a long time.

Low back pain—etiology of initial episodes is uncertain, as current literature does not support a definitive cause for initial episodes of low back pain, and risk factors are multifactorial, population specific, and only weakly associated with development.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^e3b8ae8b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

### Imaging of acute low back pain [^c6996f6a]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute low back pain, defined as less than 6 weeks in duration, does not require imaging in the absence of "red flags" that may indicate a cause, such as fracture, infection, or malignancy. When imaging is indicated, it is important to rule out a host of abnormalities that may be responsible for the pain and any associated symptoms. A common mnemonic VINDICATE can help ensure a thorough consideration of the possible causes.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^ffe80c4f]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain—diagnostic question scope: Diagnosis Question 3 asks whether, in patients with acute low back pain, there are history or physical examination findings that would predict that an episode will resolve within one month; Diagnosis Question 6 asks what patient characteristics increase or decrease the risk of developing chronic low back pain after an acute episode; Diagnosis Question 9 asks whether a psychological evaluation assists with identifying patients with low back pain who are at risk for developing chronic pain or disability. The work group considered these questions together as the vast majority of the literature evaluating the conversion from acute to chronic pain combined various demographic, social, psychological and physical examination findings in predictive models.

### Low back pain [^7fc632be]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Low back pain affects individuals of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Despite advancements in assessment and treatment methods, the management of low back pain remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. One reason for the limited success in identifying effective treatments is the large variation in the manifestations, possible causes, precipitating and maintaining factors, course, prognosis and consequences in terms of activity interference and quality of life. However, despite these challenges, steady progress has been achieved in the understanding of back pain, and important steps in the understanding of the psychological and social risk factors, genetics and brain mechanisms of low back pain have been made. These new findings have given impetus to the development of new diagnostic procedures, evidence-based screening methods and more targeted interventions, which underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of low back pain that integrates biological, psychological and social aspects.

### Mimickers of lumbar radiculopathy [^5d62c5cd]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons frequently treat patients who report pain that radiates from the back into the lower extremity. Although the most common etiology is either a herniated disk or spinal stenosis, a myriad of pathologies can mimic the symptoms of radiculopathy, resulting in differences in the clinical presentation and the workup. Therefore, the clinician must be able to distinguish the signs and symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy from pathologies that may have a similar presentation. Being cognizant of these other possible conditions enables the physician to consider a breadth of alternative diagnoses when a patient presents with radiating lower extremity pain.

### Non-specific low back pain [^054f6829]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain has become a major public health problem worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84%, and the prevalence of chronic low back pain is about 23%, with 11-12% of the population being disabled by low back pain. Mechanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major pathogenic role, but genetic constitution is important. History taking and clinical examination are included in most diagnostic guidelines, but the use of clinical imaging for diagnosis should be restricted. The mechanism of action of many treatments is unclear, and effect sizes of most treatments are low. Both patient preferences and clinical evidence should be taken into account for pain management, but generally self-management, with appropriate support, is recommended and surgery and overtreatment should be avoided.

### Differentiating radiculopathy from lower extremity arthropathy [^de02c98d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Low back and lower extremity pain are among the most common complaints encountered by physicians. Distinguishing pain due to primary extremity pathology versus lumbar radiculopathy can be challenging. Careful physical examination and appropriate imaging with plain radiographs and advanced studies as needed are important in determining the cause of lower extremity complaints. Over-utilization of advanced imaging may reveal otherwise asymptomatic spinal pathology and can lead to an incorrect diagnosis. In patients in whom surgical intervention is being considered by a spine or arthroplasty surgeon, intra-articular or epidural steroid injections may help to reveal the underlying cause of pain via short-term symptomatic relief. Additionally, patients presenting with vague lower extremity pain after recent or distant joint arthroplasty should be considered for potential failure or infection of their implant before assuming the symptoms are coming from the lumbar spine.

Introduction

Lower back pain is a common disorder; the estimated global point prevalence of activity limiting lower back pain lasting more than 1 day was 11.9±2.0% between 1980 and 2009.Lower back pain can be broadly categorized as nonspecific or specific. Nonspecific refers to lower back pain for which there is no clear causal relationship between the symptoms, physical findings and imaging findings whereas, for specific lower back pain, there is a pathoanatomical relationship between the pain and one or more pathological process.A review by Deyo and Weinstein found that among patients with specific lower back pain, 4% were diagnosed with disc herniation, 3% with spinal stenosis and 2% with spondylolisthesis.However, most cases of lower back pain (80–90%) are nonspecific and are often caused by non-pathological functional disturbances, such as sacroiliac joint syndrome.The causes of lower back pain can be mechanical, neuropathic or secondary to another cause.Approximately 90% of patients suffering from back pain achieve remission within 6 weeks.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is defined as pain located in the area between the posterior lower margins of the 12 th ribs and the gluteal folds, and may occur with associated lower limb pain/neurological involvement.LBP can be classified as acute (less than 6 weeks), subacute (6 to 12 weeks) or chronic (greater than 12 weeks).The origin of LBP is multifactorial, and is divided into non-specific LBP (NSLBP), specific, and serious pathologies.According to the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study, LBP was ranked number one for years lived with disability in 1990, 2007 and 2017, with increasing rates of occurrence for all ages.

LBP research indicates significant differences between genders regarding prevalence, degree of disability and number of comorbidities; which are all higher in individuals who identify as women.Despite known differences, research studies that focus on LBP inconsistently report or fail to integrate sex or gender differences into their design, analysis and conclusions,and it is common to observe sex and gender terms used interchangeably. This practice can not only lead to misinterpretation of results, but also impact how evidence is applied.

### Efficacy of lateral view needle placement for sacroiliac joint injections [^1040f23e]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SIJ pain is becoming increasingly recognized as a common cause of lower back pain. The differential diagnosis of SIJ pathology is broad, and misdiagnosis is common. SIJ injections can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. However, needle placement must be accurate to ensure correct diagnosis and management. Adding a lateral fluoroscopy view to the standard AP view will improve injection accuracy rates, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and subsequent patient management.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^6d794ded]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Low back pain is among the top reasons why patients seek medical care, is responsible for more disability than any other musculoskeletal condition, and has significant direct and indirect economic and health care costs.Low back pain is often associated with concurrent but distinct pain conditions including referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy, all of which are common presenting features in patients referred for electrodiagnostic assessment.However, not all pain that also affects or radiates to the buttock, thigh, or leg is caused by compression of lumbosacral spinal nerve roots.

The differential diagnosis for back pain radiating or extending into the lower limb is broad, as multiple structures and conditions can produce back and lower extremity pain, including lumbosacral radiculopathy, non‐radiculopathy disorders of the peripheral nervous system, disorders of the central nervous system, and musculoskeletal disorders.Musculoskeletal disorders, the focus of this review, can mimic and/or occur concurrently with lumbosacral radiculopathy. For example, estimates of the prevalence of lumbosacral radiculopathy range from 3% to 5% of the adult population, far lower than the point prevalence of low back pain (10%–30%) or greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) (6.6%–15%), which are just two of many mimics.,,This underscores the importance of being able to correctly identify radiculopathy with or without other concomitant musculoskeletal diagnoses.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^ed08bb63]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline glossary—radicular and related terminology is defined as follows: Radicular LBP is pain in the back and lower limb associated with a disorder of the spinal nerve root and/or its ganglion and may or may not be accompanied by objective evidence of impaired conduction (radiculopathy); non-radicular LBP typically does not radiate past the knee; radiculopathy refers to impaired conduction along a spinal nerve or its roots, may be diagnosed by clinical exam or electrodiagnostic testing, and may or may not be accompanied by radicular pain; sciatica is pain along the path of the sciatic nerve, is a symptom rather than a condition, and is often used interchangeably with radiculopathy; referred pain originates in one location but is perceived in other regions and does not involve stimulation of nerve roots, differentiating it from radicular pain; neurogenic claudication comprises leg pain symptoms while walking or standing relieved by sitting or spinal flexion and is associated with spinal stenosis; spinal stenosis is narrowing of the central spinal canal or neuroforamina usually due to degenerative changes, may also be congenital, and may or may not present with symptoms like neurogenic claudication; a herniated disc is herniation of the nucleus pulposus through its fibrous covering that can compress adjacent nerve roots; and non-specific LBP lacks signs of a serious underlying condition or specific spinal cause, with degenerative imaging changes usually considered nonspecific and often called uncomplicated LBP.

### Injection treatment and back pain associated with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in older adults [^fcebb6fe]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lower back pain is one of the most common health-related complaints in the adult population. Thirty percent of Americans 65 years and older reported symptoms of lower back pain in 2004 (NCHS, 2006). Injection treatment is a commonly used non-surgical procedure to alleviate lower back pain in older adults. However, the effectiveness of injection treatment, particularly in older adults, has not been well documented.

Objective

This study quantified the effectiveness of injection treatment on pain relief among adults 60 years and over who were diagnosed with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, a common cause of lower back pain in older adults. The variations of the effectiveness were examined by selected patient attributes.

Study Design

Prospective, non-randomized, observational human study.

Setting

Single institution spine clinic.

Methods

Patients scheduled for lumbar injection treatment between January 1 and July 1, 2008 were prospectively selected from the study spine clinic. Selection criteria included patients age 60 and over, diagnosed with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and no previous lumbar injection within 6 months or lumbar surgery within 2 years. The pain sub-score of the SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure pain at baseline and at one and 3 months post injection. Variations in longitudinal changes in pain scores by patient characteristics were analyzed in both unadjusted (univariate) analyses using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and adjusted (multiple regression) analyses using linear mixed effects models.

Limitations

This study is limited by its sample size and observational design.

Results

Of 62 patients receiving epidural steroid injections, the mean Pain score at baseline was 27.4 (SD =13.6), 41.7 (SD = 22.0) at one month and 35.8 (SD = 19.0) at 3 months. Mean Pain scores improved significantly from baseline to one month (14.1 points), and from baseline to 3 months (8.3 points). Post injection changes in pain scores varied by body mass index (BMI) and baseline emotional health. Based on a linear mixed effects model analysis, higher baseline emotional health, as measured by the SF-36 Mental Component Score (MCS >/= 50), was associated with greater reduction in pain over 3 months when compared to lower emotional health (MCS), was associated with greater reduction in pain over 3 months when compared to lower emotional health (MCS <50). In patients with higher emotional health, pain scores improved by 14.1 (P < .05: 95% CI 6.9, 21.3). Patients who were obese also showed significant improvement in pain scores over 3 months compared to non-obese patients. In obese patients, pain scores increased by 7.9 (P <.05; 95% CI:1.0, 14.8) points.

Conclusion

Lower back pain in older adults with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis might be clinically significantly alleviated after injection treatment. Pain relief varies by a patients personal and clinical characteristics. Healthier emotional status and obesity appears to be associated with more pain relief experienced over 3 months following injection.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain—definition and inclusion/exclusion criteria are specified. Low back pain is defined as pain of musculoskeletal origin extending from the lowest rib to the gluteal fold that may at times extend as somatic referred pain into the thigh (above the knee). Inclusion applies to adult patients aged 18 and older with low back pain limited to somatic referred pain/non-radicular pain limited to above the knee only. Exclusion criteria are patients less than 18 years of age; low back pain due to tumor, infection, metabolic disease, inflammatory arthritis, or fracture; patients with a diagnosed deformity, including spondylolisthesis, spondylolysis and scoliosis; pain experienced below the knee; extra-spinal conditions (ie, visceral, vascular, genito-urinary); patients who have undergone prior lumbar surgery; presence of neurological deficit; back pain that is associated with widespread multi-site pain (>2 sites); and pregnancy.

5.1.2 Lumbar spinal stenosis—definition, affected levels, causes, symptoms, and surgical prevalence: Spinal stenosis is the result of abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recess or the intervertebral foramina, resulting in pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. The two lower motion segments (L3-L4 and L4-L5) are the most commonly affected. Common causes include disc-related degeneration, osteophyte formation, herniated discs, arthritis, ligament or facet joint hypertrophy, epidural fat deposition, spinal tumors, and traumas. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common source of back and leg pain, and often involves weakness and numbness; more severe cases may present with neurological symptoms such as radiculopathy, myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome, and permanent numbness or paralysis can result from a long-term compression. Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common cause of spinal surgery in patients over 65 years old.

### Common health issues and advised treatments reported in an ultraendurance ocean rowing race [^6088948c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Inshore rowers commonly report musculoskeletal injury to the lower back, and occasionally knee pain, often caused by excessive loading.Risk factors for lower back pain in these rowers include: rowing for more than 30 minutes; rapid increases in training, competition loads and intensities; previous lower back problems; rough water; fatigue or poor technique.Ocean rowers can row between 10 and 16 hours a day for months at a time.This constant motion can overload lower lumbar regions and knee joints causing pain similar to inshore rowers (figure 1). Incidences of severe knee pain could also be caused by foot steering systems. This twisting motion, together with rough sea-states, throws rowers off balance mid-stroke, causing awkward loading of the knee joints. Educating rowers in effective pain management progression and the biomechanics of their injuries may help them effectively manage pain and limit joint strain.

Musculoskeletal complaints were common throughout the race, especially in the first four weeks. Ocean rowing is an amateur sport, with limited professional guidance in rower preparation and training. This may leave athletes inadequately prepared for the physical challenges involved and explain the high volume of musculoskeletal injuries seen early in the race. Further research into appropriate pre-race strength training programmes, with exercise regimes adapted to the individual, may aid rower preparation and reduce injury frequencies.

Regular monitoring of a rower’s pain levels using standardised rating scales will help determine severity, and when longer lasting injuries might benefit from a multidisciplinary approach.Screening for previous lower back pain may help susceptible rowers better prepare and manage any symptoms experienced at sea. Performing different exercises while at sea may be difficult, but modifications to a rower’s shift pattern may help provide time for recovery management. Awareness of associated neurological symptoms or decline in mental health is essential to ensure rower safety at sea and directing further investigations and management.

- intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation as a similarly effective option

- the small-to-moderate average benefit from surgery versus noninterdisciplinary nonsurgical therapy

- the fact that the majority of such patients undergoing surgery do not experience an optimal outcome, defined as minimum or no pain, discontinuation of or occasional pain medication use, and return of high-level function.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^03b36fa4]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Approach to Evaluation and Management

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s this entity was most frequently called “greater trochanteric bursitis;” however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45%, and it commonly occurs in people with knee OA, as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias radiating down the lateral thigh along the course of the iliotibial band. Table 2 reviews additional common pain characteristics which can be elicited during the patient history to help distinguish GTPS from other conditions.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^53246618]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Trials evaluating treatments for low back pain (LBP), show at best moderate effect sizes. The heterogeneity of LBP patients within studies is one explanation for these results. This has stimulated research aiming to identify more homogeneous, clinically relevant subgroups of LBP patients, with the hope that these subgroups might respond more favourably to interventions or management approaches matched to the subgroup’s characteristics or presenting symptoms.

One of the most common subgroup of LBP is back pain radiating to the leg, which represents about two thirds of back pain patients, in both primary and secondary care settings. Patients with low back-related leg pain (LBLP) suffer more severe pain and disability, take longer to recover and lose more time from work, compared to those with pain in the lower back alone.

When patients present with LBLP, once serious pathology (such as tumours, cauda equina compression, fracture, inflammatory causes) is ruled out, the differential diagnosis is between leg pain that is due to spinal nerve root involvement (commonly called sciatica) or to non-specific pain in the leg thought to be referred from structures in the back (e.g. disc/muscle/joint) but not involving the nerve root.

This is a rather broad brush categorisation however and currently there is a gap in the evidence regarding whether individual items from the clinical assessment, can be used to identify hitherto unrecognised subgroups of patients with LBLP who have distinct presentations of symptoms and characteristics. Early identification and differentiation of subgroups of LBLP may provide more help when informing patients about prognosis, tailoring treatment plans to match profiles and guiding the need for referrals to specialist services in a timely fashion.

The objective of this study was to use items from clinical assessment to identify new subgroups in an unselected primary care population consulting with LBLP. Statistical modelling, such as latent class analysis provides a method of classifying patients and may lead to the identification of clusters of patients with similar characteristics, over and above the binary diagnostic categories of sciatica or referred leg pain. Clusters identified in this way were compared for baseline demographic, pain, physical function, psychosocial and work features, risk of persistent disability and findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine. Key characteristics reflecting pain, disability, psychological status and perceived recovery were compared at 4 and 12 months and the clinical course, in terms of monthly pain and disability scores over 12 months for the individual clusters, was described and compared to that of the clinically defined groups of LBLP patients with and without a diagnosis of sciatica.

### Acupuncture for chronic nonspecific low back pain [^87cecb41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is very common; it is defined as pain without a recognizable etiology that lasts for more than three months. Some clinical practice guidelines suggest that acupuncture can offer an effective alternative therapy. This review is a split from an earlier Cochrane review and it focuses on chronic LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of acupuncture compared to sham intervention, no treatment, or usual care for chronic nonspecific LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, two Chinese databases, and two trial registers to 29 August 2019 without restrictions on language or publication status. We also screened reference lists and LBP guidelines to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for chronic nonspecific LBP in adults. We excluded RCTs that investigated LBP with a specific etiology. We included trials comparing acupuncture with sham intervention, no treatment, and usual care. The primary outcomes were pain, back-specific functional status, and quality of life; the secondary outcomes were pain-related disability, global assessment, or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. We meta-analyzed data that were clinically homogeneous using a random-effects model in Review Manager 5.3. Otherwise, we reported the data qualitatively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 33 studies (37 articles) with 8270 participants. The majority of studies were carried out in Europe, Asia, North and South America. Seven studies (5572 participants) conducted in Germany accounted for 67% of the participants. Sixteen trials compared acupuncture with sham intervention, usual care, or no treatment. Most studies had high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of the acupuncturist. A few studies were found to have high risk of detection, attrition, reporting or selection bias. We found low-certainty evidence (seven trials, 1403 participants) that acupuncture may relieve pain in the immediate term (up to seven days) compared to sham intervention (mean difference (MD) -9.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.82 to -4.61, visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-100). The difference did not meet the clinically important threshold of 15 points or 30% relative change. Very low-certainty evidence from five trials (1481 participants) showed that acupuncture was not more effective than sham in improving back-specific function in the immediate term (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.06; corresponding to the Hannover Function Ability Questionnaire (HFAQ, 0 to 100, higher values better) change (MD 3.33 points; 95% CI -1.25 to 7.90)). Three trials (1068 participants) yielded low-certainty evidence that acupuncture seemed not to be more effective clinically in the short term for quality of life (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.45; corresponding to the physical 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12, 0-100, higher values better) change (MD 2.33 points; 95% CI 0.29 to 4.37)). The reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence to either low to very low were risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. We found moderate-certainty evidence that acupuncture produced greater and clinically important pain relief (MD -20.32, 95% CI -24.50 to -16.14; four trials, 366 participants; (VAS, 0 to 100), and improved back function (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.34; five trials, 2960 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change (MD 11.50 points; 95% CI 7.38 to 15.84)) in the immediate term compared to no treatment. The evidence was downgraded to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. No studies reported on quality of life in the short term or adverse events. Low-certainty evidence (five trials, 1054 participants) suggested that acupuncture may reduce pain (MD -10.26, 95% CI -17.11 to -3.40; not clinically important on 0 to 100 VAS), and improve back-specific function immediately after treatment (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: -0.77 to -0.17; five trials, 1381 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change (MD 9.78 points, 95% CI 3.54 to 16.02)) compared to usual care. Moderate-certainty evidence from one trial (731 participants) found that acupuncture was more effective in improving physical quality of life (MD 4.20, 95% CI 2.82 to 5.58) but not mental quality of life in the short term (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.55). The certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate to low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Low-certainty evidence suggested a similar incidence of adverse events immediately after treatment in the acupuncture and sham intervention groups (four trials, 465 participants) (RR 0.68 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01), and the acupuncture and usual care groups (one trial, 74 participants) (RR 3.34, 95% CI 0.36 to 30.68). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trial reported adverse events for acupuncture when compared to no treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events in the acupuncture groups were insertion point pain, bruising, hematoma, bleeding, worsening of LBP, and pain other than LBP (pain in leg and shoulder).

Authors' Conclusions

We found that acupuncture may not play a more clinically meaningful role than sham in relieving pain immediately after treatment or in improving quality of life in the short term, and acupuncture possibly did not improve back function compared to sham in the immediate term. However, acupuncture was more effective than no treatment in improving pain and function in the immediate term. Trials with usual care as the control showed acupuncture may not reduce pain clinically, but the therapy may improve function immediately after sessions as well as physical but not mental quality of life in the short term. The evidence was downgraded to moderate to very low-certainty considering most of studies had high risk of bias, inconsistency, and small sample size introducing imprecision. The decision to use acupuncture to treat chronic low back pain might depend on the availability, cost and patient's preferences.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^bdddcd2f]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many physicians assume that an older adult with low back pain (LBP) and concomitant lateral hip/thigh pain has lumbar spinal stenosis. However, in reality there are myriad causes of lateral hip/thigh pain in older adults and the diagnosis of this pain can be challenging due to pain referral patterns. First, the hip and nearby lumbopelvic structures share innervation from common nerve roots, so pain referral patterns from pathology of these structures overlap. Second, faulty mechanics of the lumbar spine and/or hip can lead to compensatory movement patterns and eventually result in multiple pain generators. These challenges are illustrated in a study by Sembrano and colleagues. In a sample of 200 patients presenting for evaluation by a spine surgeon, only 65% had isolated spine pain, whereas 17.5% had a combination of hip, spine, and/or sacroiliac (SI) joint pain. Lastly, diagnosing the etiology of hip and lumbopelvic pain in older adults is challenging in that many people have structural abnormalities on imaging studies that are asymptomatic. For instance, 93% of asymptomatic people 60–80 years old have MRI evidence of disc degeneration, 36% have a herniated disc, and 21% have spinal stenosis. Additionally, only 46.5% of women ages 65 years and older who have radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) report hip pain “on most days for at least 1 month”.

Funnel Plot Assessing Publication Bias in Studies on the Incidence of Acute Low Back Pain After Spaceflights.

Qualitative interviews allowed the astronauts to describe their pain experiences during the flight.When exposed to microgravity, Astronaut 1 described experiencing lower back pain and headaches. Although the lower back pain decreased after two to three days on the International Space Station (ISS), they continued to experience “a higher number of headaches than usual”. They also mentioned feelings of “nausea, disorientation, and general discomfort”, which gradually improved in two to three days. Notably, they expressed relief at the absence of shoulder pain during the seventeen days in space, stating: “I didn’t notice any shoulder pain at all during the seventeen days I was in space. That was great!”. However, upon returning to Earth, they reported that the shoulder pain had returned “to where it was before”. Additionally, they mentioned experiencing muscle pain and stiffness, especially in their calves, immediately after return, likening it to having had intense calf training. They also described lower back pain, characterized as “spasms”, although seven days after their return to Earth, they reported that muscle pain and lower back pain had mostly decreased, commenting: “my muscles are getting used to carrying my body in 1G”.

Astronaut 2 described previous episodes of common pain, usually related to injuries such as a tibia fracture four years prior.During space training and aboard the ISS, they experienced predictable discomfort in their tibia, exacerbated by exercise and prolonged standing. In microgravity, they reported significant lower back pain from the outset and also mentioned pain in their left iliotibial band. Upon returning to Earth, they continued to feel pain in their distal tibia, especially when initiating movement after prolonged periods of rest.

Finally, sensory changes in both astronauts included increased thresholds for mechanical touch detection, temporal summation of pain, heat pain thresholds, and differences in conditioned pain modulation after the flight.Therefore, this study suggests that spaceflight can affect various aspects of sensory perception and regulation in astronauts.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: systematic review [^82d07624]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a major cause of disability,leading to considerable healthcare expenditure around the world, especially in high income countries.The difficulty in providing a definitive diagnosis for most presentations of back pain has given rise to the term “non-specific low back pain,” which is generally considered to be benign and can be managed in a primary care setting.Some patients, however, present with low back pain as the initial manifestation of a more serious pathology, such as malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. Spinal fracture and malignancy are the most common serious pathologies affecting the spine. In patients with low back pain presenting to primary care, between 1% and 4% will have a spinal fractureand in less than 1% malignancy, whether primary tumour or metastasis, will be the underlying cause.

### Exercise therapy for treatment of acute non-specific low back pain [^23637882]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability globally. It generates considerable direct costs (healthcare) and indirect costs (lost productivity). The many available treatments for LBP include exercise therapy, which is practised extensively worldwide.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise therapy for acute non-specific low back pain in adults compared to sham/placebo treatment or no treatment at short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term follow-up.

Search Methods

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005. We conducted an updated search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers. We screened the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews published since 2004.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that examined the effects of exercise therapy on non-specific LBP lasting six weeks or less in adults. Major outcomes for this review were pain, functional status, and perceived recovery. Minor outcomes were return to work, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Our main comparisons were exercise therapy versus sham/placebo treatment and exercise therapy versus no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We evaluated outcomes at short-term follow-up (time point within three months and closest to six weeks after randomisation; main follow-up), intermediate-term follow-up (between nine months and closest to six months), and long-term follow-up (after nine months and closest to 12 months); and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 23 studies (13 from the previous review, 10 new studies) that involved 2674 participants and provided data for 2637 participants. Three small studies are awaiting classification, and four eligible studies are ongoing. Included studies were conducted in Europe (N = 9), the Asia-Pacific region (N = 9), and North America (N = 5); and most took place in a primary care setting (N = 12), secondary care setting (N = 6), or both (N = 1). In most studies, the population was middle-aged and included men and women. We judged 10 studies (43%) at low risk of bias with regard to sequence generation and allocation concealment. Blinding is not feasible in exercise therapy, introducing performance and detection bias. There is very low-certainty evidence that exercise therapy compared with sham/placebo treatment has no clinically relevant effect on pain scores in the short term (mean difference (MD) -0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.79 to 4.19; 1 study, 299 participants). The absolute difference was 1% less pain (95% CI 4% more to 6% less), and the relative difference was 4% less pain (95% CI 20% more to 28% less). The mean pain score was 20.1 (standard deviation (SD) 21) for the intervention group and 20.9 (SD 23) for the control group. There is very low-certainty evidence that exercise therapy compared with sham/placebo treatment has no clinically relevant effect on functional status scores in the short term (MD 2.00, 95% CI -2.20 to 6.20; 1 study, 299 participants). The absolute difference was 2% worse functional status (95% CI 2% better to 6% worse), and the relative difference was 15% worse (95% CI 17% better to 47% worse). The mean functional status score was 15.3 (SD 19) for the intervention group and 13.3 (SD 18) for the control group. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for pain and functional status by one level for risk of bias and by two levels for imprecision (only one study with fewer than 400 participants). There is very low-certainty evidence that exercise therapy compared with no treatment has no clinically relevant effect on pain or functional status in the short term (2 studies, 157 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by two levels for imprecision and by one level for inconsistency. One study associated exercise with small benefits and the other found no differences. The first study was conducted in an occupational healthcare centre, where participants received one exercise therapy session. The other study was conducted in secondary and tertiary care settings, where participants received treatment three times per week for six weeks. We did not pool data from these studies owing to considerable clinical heterogeneity. In two studies, there were no reported adverse events. One study reported adverse events unrelated to exercise therapy. The remaining studies did not report whether any adverse events had occurred. Owing to insufficient reporting of adverse events, we were unable to reach any conclusions on the safety or harms related to exercise therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise therapy compared to sham/placebo treatment may have no clinically relevant effect on pain or functional status in the short term in people with acute non-specific LBP, but the evidence is very uncertain. Exercise therapy compared to no treatment may have no clinically relevant effect on pain or functional status in the short term in people with acute non-specific LBP, but the evidence is very uncertain. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low for inconsistency, risk of bias concerns, and imprecision (few participants).

### Evaluating lower back pain with the aid of imaging (...) [^7f50edac]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Because the symptoms and pathologic causes may not be obviously related, making a definitive diagnosis can be difficult. The differential diagnosis can be categorized into mechanical causes that do not involve inflammation or infection; nonmechanical causes that include inflammation, infection, and infiltrative disease; and visceral causes that do not involve the spine. Some diagnoses, which remain controversial, include spinal instability and internal disc disruption. The approach to correctly diagnosing lower back pain involves identifying underlying systemic disease, recognizing neurologic impairment that may require surgery, and acknowledging any psychosocial factors contributing to the pain. Sciatica is often the first clue to neurologic involvement in back pain, especially in younger adults. True radicular pain usually travels to below the knee. Herniated intervertebral discs, generally involving the L5 or S1 nerve roots, are the most common cause of sciatica.

Spinal stenosis results from bone abnormality, soft tissue pressure, or both, and it occurs more commonly in older adults. The classic symptom of spinal stenosis is neurogenic claudication when the patient is standing. Numbness and tingling also may be present, with symptom relief when the patient is sitting and the spine is flexed. Cauda equina syndrome, resulting from local compression, is a surgical emergency, with the most common symptoms being urinary retention, sciatica, sensory and motor deficits, abnormal straight-leg raising, and decreased sphincter tone. Sensory deficits frequently are present over the buttocks, thighs, and perineum. Lumbar radiography has the potential of serious radiation exposure to the gonads that may be especially hazardous in young women. Plain radiographs are less sensitive for metastatic lesions than are other imaging tests. When lytic or blastic lesions are seen, the specificity is high, but the sensitivity is low.

Compression fractures may be seen well, but the chronicity of the fracture cannot be judged. Results are poorer for identification of bone infection, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or nerve root impingement. Gadolinium can be used to enhance the nerve roots and increase specificity, but this step is probably not necessary unless the patient has undergone surgery. MRI is probably the best technique to characterize spinal infections, with gadolinium increasing specificity. MRI is also useful for identifying bone metastases and other marrow infiltrative diseases. Bone scanning with radioactive compounds is useful for detecting infections, stress fractures, symptomatic spondylolysis, and metastatic disease.

### Exercise therapy for chronic low back pain [^52efff10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain has been the leading cause of disability globally for at least the past three decades and results in enormous direct healthcare and lost productivity costs.

Objectives

The primary objective of this systematic review is to assess the impact of exercise treatment on pain and functional limitations in adults with chronic non-specific low back pain compared to no treatment, usual care, placebo and other conservative treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which includes the Cochrane Back and Neck trials register), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), and conducted citation searching of relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies. The review includes data for trials identified in searches up to 27 April 2018. All eligible trials have been identified through searches to 7 December 2020, but have not yet been extracted; these trials will be integrated in the next update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that assessed exercise treatment compared to no treatment, usual care, placebo or other conservative treatment on the outcomes of pain or functional limitations for a population of adult participants with chronic non-specific low back pain of more than 12 weeks' duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened and assessed studies independently, with consensus. We extracted outcome data using electronic databases; pain and functional limitations outcomes were re-scaled to 0 to 100 points for meta-analyses where 0 is no pain or functional limitations. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool and used GRADE to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence. When required, we contacted study authors to obtain missing data. To interpret meta-analysis results, we considered a 15-point difference in pain and a 10-point difference in functional limitations outcomes to be clinically important for the primary comparison of exercise versus no treatment, usual care or placebo.

Main Results

We included 249 trials of exercise treatment, including studies conducted in Europe (122 studies), Asia (38 studies), North America (33 studies), and the Middle East (24 studies). Sixty-one per cent of studies (151 trials) examined the effectiveness of two or more different types of exercise treatment, and 57% (142 trials) compared exercise treatment to a non-exercise comparison treatment. Study participants had a mean age of 43.7 years and, on average, 59% of study populations were female. Most of the trials were judged to be at risk of bias, including 79% at risk of performance bias due to difficulty blinding exercise treatments. We found moderate-certainty evidence that exercise treatment is more effective for treatment of chronic low back pain compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo comparisons for pain outcomes at earliest follow-up (MD -15.2, 95% CI -18.3 to -12.2), a clinically important difference. Certainty of evidence was downgraded mainly due to heterogeneity. For the same comparison, there was moderate-certainty evidence for functional limitations outcomes (MD -6.8 (95% CI -8.3 to -5.3); this finding did not meet our prespecified threshold for minimal clinically important difference. Certainty of evidence was downgraded mainly due to some evidence of publication bias.  Compared to all other investigated conservative treatments, exercise treatment was found to have improved pain (MD -9.1, 95% CI -12.6 to -5.6) and functional limitations outcomes (MD -4.1, 95% CI -6.0 to -2.2). These effects did not meet our prespecified threshold for clinically important difference. Subgroup analysis of pain outcomes suggested that exercise treatment is probably more effective than education alone (MD -12.2, 95% CI -19.4 to -5.0) or non-exercise physical therapy (MD -10.4, 95% CI -15.2 to -5.6), but with no differences observed for manual therapy (MD 1.0, 95% CI -3.1 to 5.1). In studies that reported adverse effects (86 studies), one or more adverse effects were reported in 37 of 112 exercise groups (33%) and 12 of 42 comparison groups (29%). Twelve included studies reported measuring adverse effects in a systematic way, with a median of 0.14 (IQR 0.01 to 0.57) per participant in the exercise groups (mostly minor harms, e.g. muscle soreness), and 0.12 (IQR 0.02 to 0.32) in comparison groups.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-certainty evidence that exercise is probably effective for treatment of chronic low back pain compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo for pain. The observed treatment effect for the exercise compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo comparisons is small for functional limitations, not meeting our threshold for minimal clinically important difference. We also found exercise to have improved pain (low-certainty evidence) and functional limitations outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence) compared to other conservative treatments; however, these effects were small and not clinically important when considering all comparisons together. Subgroup analysis suggested that exercise treatment is probably more effective than advice or education alone, or electrotherapy, but with no differences observed for manual therapy treatments.

Lumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome is a very rare cause of low back and radicular lower limb pain. More common conditions include different pathological processes caused by degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, including spondylolisthesis, intervertebral disk bulging and herniation, and facet joint arthropathy. Neoplastic and inflammatory infiltration of the nerve roots and plexi are other less common causes of radiculopathy and plexopathy. Another consideration in our case who had diabetes and radiculopathy symptoms in the left lower limb would have been diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, a monophasic entity that can present in even well-controlled cases of type 2 diabetes.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations

Low-back pain (LBP)

Classification LBP is localized to the lumbar vertebrae (L1–l5) just above the gluteus muscle. LBP can be classified by duration as acute (<6 weeks), subacute (6–12 weeks) and chronic (>12 weeks). LBP may be classified by cause as mechanical (strains/sprains or fractures), nonmechanical (tumors) and referred pain (kidney or gall stones or pain in nearby tissue). LBP is classified by mechanism or “diagnostic triage” into serious spinal pathology (accompanied by “red flags”), nerve root pain/radicular pain and nonspecific LBP.
Diagnosis Use diagnostic methods such as physical examination, X-rays, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diskography, bone scans and blood tests (B).– Identify “red flags”, which are signs/symptoms that are unlikely to be observed in normal LBP and generally indicate involvement of serious pathology. Identifying the red flags may help diagnose underlying chronic conditions, such as cancer (C). Identify “yellow flags’, which represent the psychosocial barriers that may influence the subjective response to pain and which may delay recovery or indicate the risk of chronification or disability (C).
Treatment Initiate treatment with acetaminophen and mild NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac) as first-line therapy (A). Second-line therapy should typically involve a combination of NSAIDs and mild opioids (codeine, tramadol) (A),,followed by moderate-to-strong opioids (morphine, fentanyl) in severe pain. Third-line therapy should be initiated in case a central origin is suspected or if pain significantly affects the physical, mental and social behavior of patients; it may include anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin),sedatives (benzodiazepines) and antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) (A).–

Although back pain has traditionally been considered a rare and often sinister presentation in the paediatric age group, recent literature now suggests that a relatively high number of children do experience back pain, but only a small proportion seek medical attention. For the majority of children with back pain no underlying cause is identified, but some require investigation to exclude serious underlying pathology. Laboratory and imaging investigations should be targeted towards those with "red flag" symptoms and signs. Imaging studies, particularly MRI, have an important role in diagnosis of underlying pathology such as infection or malignancy.

Discussion

Chronic lower back pain is one of the most common diagnoses in the adult and pediatric populations across the world. More than 200 billion dollars are spent annually for chronic back pain management.Low back pain due to SCN entrapment syndrome is commonly undiagnosed because of lack of awareness about this disorder. It can be misdiagnosed for another disorder because the clinical symptoms and physical examination findings present similarly to other common lower back disorders, such as spondylolysis or lumbar disk herniation.However, the radiating pain from SCN entrapment syndrome can frequently be distinguished from a disk herniation by its sensory distribution. The SCN innervation is most commonly in the L1-L3 dermatomal distribution, which typically presents at or above the knee.There is also a typically negative straight leg raise and no associated muscle weakness. The pain from spondylolysis, on the other hand, will be in the midline and correlated anatomically with the radiographic location of the spondylolysis.

This case study highlights the need for more discussion on this topic amongst orthopaedic surgeons evaluating and treating adolescent patients with chronic low back pain. It is also important for family physicians and pediatricians to be aware of this clinical diagnosis to correctly refer them for further management and treatment. As more research focuses on SCN entrapment syndrome in adolescents, this will ultimately reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis. Additional research is needed to learn the long-term outcomes and complications of these treatments and to find nonsurgical alternatives to treating this diagnosis.

Introduction

Lower back pain is a widespread and significant clinical issue, with an approximate incidence of 80% in adults.Multiple studies have established that degenerative disc disease (DDD) and lumbar disc herniation are among the most prevalent causes of lower back pain.

In 1927, Christian Georg Schmorl first described Schmorl’s nodes (SNs) as the protrusion of disc material past the endplate into the vertebral body. SNs are benign lesions with prevalence rates ranging from 2% to 76%.

Although Schmorl’s nodes (SNs) are commonly asymptomatic incidental findings, their association with back pain remains controversial.Recent studies suggest that symptomatic SNs are often accompanied by MRI-detectable features such as adjacent bone marrow edema and Modic-type endplate changes.These pathological findings may reflect subchondral endplate microfractures and local inflammation, activating nociceptors and contributing to discogenic lower back pain.Previous studies have indicated an association between the presence of SNs and DDD, potentially leading to discogenic lower back pain. However, the exact correlation between radiographic alterations and spinal pathology remains contentious.Discogenic lower back pain originates from degenerative disc material produced by internal disc disruption. Neural ingrowth into the nucleus pulposus occurs through radial fissures in the degenerated disc. This process is accompanied by the release of pain-related inflammatory mediators and cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), substance P, and interleukins.Studies have suggested that endplate impairment by SNs is an important cause of discogenic pain.

Discography is the definitive method for diagnosing discogenic lower back pain, with positive discography eliciting concordant lower back pain by injecting a contrast agent into the disc.Discogenic lower back pain associated with sacral nerves is highly suspected when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals Modic-I changes—characterized by reduced signal intensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images (T2WI) in the endplate adjacent to the SNs. This suspicion is further confirmed when discography elicits concordant lower back pain in the index segment containing the SNs.

SNs can cause a unique discogenic back pain that is refractory to conservative treatment for at least 3 months, and surgical interventions are required. Improvements have been reported for SNs using surgical treatment, including lumbar interbody fusion, spinal decompression, and disc block, but all were limited to small sample sizes or case reports.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^5c5dbc85]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and diagnostic approach—For patients with low back pain, we recommend the history and physical examination include evaluation for progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits and other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection) (Strong for). For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) are present (Strong for). For patients with acute low back pain, without focal neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or performing invasive diagnostic tests (Strong against). For patients with low back pain, we suggest assessing psychosocial factors and using predictive screening instruments (e.g., STarT Back and The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire) to inform treatment planning (Weak for). For patients with low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific physical examination maneuvers to assist in the diagnosis of facet or sacroiliac joint pain, or a lumbar/lumbo-sacral radiculopathy (Neither for nor against).

### Red flags to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with low-back pain [^fe314d4f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Editorial Note

See https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD014461.pub2/full for a more recent review that covers this topic and has superseded this review.

Background

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common condition seen in primary care. A principal aim during a clinical examination is to identify patients with a higher likelihood of underlying serious pathology, such as vertebral fracture, who may require additional investigation and specific treatment. All 'evidence-based' clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of red flags to screen for serious causes of back pain. However, it remains unclear if the diagnostic accuracy of red flags is sufficient to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of red flags obtained in a clinical history or physical examination to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP.

Search Methods

Electronic databases were searched for primary studies between the earliest date and 7 March 2012. Forward and backward citation searching of eligible studies was also conducted.

Selection Criteria

Studies were considered if they compared the results of any aspect of the history or test conducted in the physical examination of patients presenting for LBP or examination of the lumbar spine, with a reference standard (diagnostic imaging). The selection criteria were independently applied by two review authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. Risk of bias was assessed using the 11-item QUADAS tool. Characteristics of studies, patients, index tests and reference standards were extracted. Where available, raw data were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to the heterogeneity of studies and tests, statistical pooling was not appropriate and the analysis for the review was descriptive only. Likelihood ratios for each test were calculated and used as an indication of clinical usefulness.

Main Results

Eight studies set in primary (four), secondary (one) and tertiary care (accident and emergency = three) were included in the review. Overall, the risk of bias of studies was moderate with high risk of selection and verification bias the predominant flaws. Reporting of index and reference tests was poor. The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident and emergency settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%. There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies. Descriptive analyses revealed that three red flags in primary care were potentially useful with meaningful positive likelihood ratios (LR+) but mostly imprecise estimates (significant trauma, older age, corticosteroid use; LR+ point estimate ranging 3.42 to 12.85, 3.69 to 9.39, 3.97 to 48.50 respectively). One red flag in tertiary care appeared informative (contusion/abrasion; LR+ 31.09, 95% CI 18.25 to 52.96). The results of combined tests appeared more informative than individual red flags with LR+ estimates generally greater in magnitude and precision.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for LBP. Based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. When combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. It should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with LBP. Further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute back pain in the emergency department [^f197b9fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Back pain is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. The key to proper evaluation is a history and physical examination focused on determining if any red flags for serious disease are present. If no red flags are present, the patient most likely has nonspecific back pain and their symptoms will resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. No diagnostic testing is required. For patients with red flags, a focused history and examination in conjunction with diagnostic laboratory tests and imaging determine whether the patient has an emergent condition such as herniated disc, epidural compression, or spinal infection.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^85ee5661]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is one of the most common causes of low back pain, accounting for 15 to 30% of all cases. Although SIJ dysfunction accounts for a large portion of chronic low back pain prevalence, it is often overlooked or under diagnosed and subsequently under treated. The purpose of this review was to establish a best practices model to effectively diagnose SIJ pain through detailed history, physical exam, review of imaging, and diagnostic block.

Methods

A literature search was performed on the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The authors proposed diagnostic recommendations based upon the available literature and a detailed understanding of diagnosing SIJ pain.

Results

The practitioner must focus on the history, location of pain, observed gait pattern, and perform key points of the physical exam including sacroiliac provocative maneuvers. If the patient exhibits at least three provocative maneuvers then the SIJ may be considered as a possible source of pain. Additionally, a thorough review of the imaging should be performed to rule out other etiologies of low back pain. In the absence of any pathognomonic tests or examination findings, diagnostic SIJ blocks have evolved as the diagnostic standard.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of SIJ pain is a multifaceted process that involves a careful assessment including differentiating other pain generators in the region. This involves careful history taking, appropriate physical examination including provocative maneuvers and diagnostic injections. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, long-term solutions may be considered, including recent advances in sacral lateral branch denervation and sacroiliac joint fusion.
