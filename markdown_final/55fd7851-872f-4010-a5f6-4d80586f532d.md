## Question

What disease causes bone spurs on the opposite side of aorta and disc Space narrowing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which disease causes bone spurs on the side opposite the aorta and disc space narrowing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "bone spurs on the opposite side of the aorta" implies anatomically and radiologically. Then, I should verify which spinal disorder classically shows osteophytes that are preferentially contralateral to the descending aorta. Next, I will check whether that same entity explains disc space narrowing. Finally, I will consider key differentials and confirm the diagnosis with imaging features and clinical context.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and imaging correlates. "Bone spurs" in the spine are osteophytes arising from vertebral endplates, whereas "disc space narrowing" reflects loss of intervertebral disc height, both classic features of degenerative disc disease and spondylosis on radiographs and MRI, though osteophytes can also occur in other entities such as DISH and axial spondyloarthritis, so I need to be precise about morphology and distribution [^117D5xuX] [^1166n7VV] [^116sFJQi].

> Wait, let me verify the "opposite side of the aorta" clue. The phrase points to a laterality pattern of anterior vertebral osteophytes relative to the descending thoracic aorta; in DISH, flowing anterior longitudinal ligament ossification and large osteophytes characteristically develop contralateral to the aorta, a phenomenon attributed to aortic pulsation inhibiting ipsilateral new bone formation, the so‑called aortic pulsation protective effect, which has been repeatedly demonstrated on CT cohorts and quantitative morphometrics [^113vVVYx] [^111teXMe] [^113ZQwiu].

> Hold on, I should confirm whether disc space narrowing fits with that same entity. DISH is classically described with preservation of disc height and no endplate erosion, so I initially thought disc narrowing would exclude DISH; but wait, let me reconsider, because coexisting degenerative disc disease is common in older adults, and DISH can indeed overlap with age‑related disc space loss and endplate changes, meaning disc narrowing can be present alongside DISH osteophytes even though DISH itself is defined by ligamentous ossification rather than primary disc pathology [^117TZ1Ew] [^117D5xuX].

> I will now examine the differential to avoid premature closure. Degenerative spondylosis produces osteophytes and disc space narrowing but lacks the characteristic contralateral‑to‑aorta distribution seen in DISH; ankylosing spondylitis forms vertical syndesmophytes rather than broad, flowing anterior osteophytes and typically preserves disc height early; and vascular or neoplastic processes can erode bone but do not explain patterned osteophyte formation opposite the aorta, so the laterality clue remains highly specific for DISH in this context [^116sFJQi] [^117TZ1Ew] [^111teXMe].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The most parsimonious explanation for bone spurs on the side opposite the aorta with disc space narrowing is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis with superimposed degenerative disc disease; DISH accounts for the characteristic contralateral osteophyte distribution driven by aortic pulsation, while age‑related degenerative disc disease explains the disc height loss, and both can coexist in the same patient, which reconciles the apparent contradiction between classic DISH features and the presence of disc narrowing [^113vVVYx] [^111teXMe] [^117D5xuX].

> Next, I should review how to confirm this radiologically. On CT, DISH shows flowing anterior ossification and large, bulky osteophytes often spanning multiple levels, with a predilection for the thoracic spine and a tendency to lie contralateral to the descending aorta; MRI helps assess disc degeneration, endplate changes, and any cord or root compromise, while plain films can show disc space narrowing and osteophytes but may miss soft‑tissue ossification; careful multiplanar assessment allows differentiation from syndesmophytes and other mimics [^114T5crf] [^114GkY1G] [^113vVVYx].

> But wait, what if the "opposite side" phrasing reflects a right‑sided aorta rather than a left‑sided one. I should double‑check that the protective effect has been validated in right‑sided aortas as well; indeed, cohorts with right‑sided descending aorta demonstrate the same contralateral predominance of flowing osteophytes, supporting the generalizability of the aortic pulsation mechanism regardless of sidedness, which strengthens the diagnostic inference here [^111teXMe].

> Final answer: The disease that causes bone spurs on the side opposite the aorta with disc space narrowing is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis with coexisting degenerative disc disease; the contralateral osteophyte distribution is a hallmark of DISH due to aortic pulsation inhibiting ipsilateral new bone formation, while disc space narrowing reflects superimposed age‑related disc degeneration rather than primary DISH pathology [^113vVVYx] [^111teXMe] [^117D5xuX].

The most likely disease causing bone spurs on the side opposite the aorta and disc space narrowing is **diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)** [^113FQvM8], with **degenerative disc disease (DDD)** as a common coexisting process. DISH produces large, flowing anterior osteophytes that often develop contralateral to the aorta due to aortic pulsation inhibiting ipsilateral bone formation [^113vVVYx] [^111teXMe], while DDD causes disc space narrowing and smaller osteophytes from mechanical degeneration [^111uuqdH]. Together, these features explain the described imaging pattern.

---

## Pathophysiology and imaging features

Key characteristics of DISH and DDD:

| **Aspect** | **Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (dish)** | **Degenerative disc disease (ddd)** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | DISH is characterized by calcification and ossification of ligaments and entheses, especially the anterior longitudinal ligament, producing large, flowing anterior osteophytes [^113FQvM8] | DDD is a progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc with loss of disc height, endplate changes, and osteophyte formation [^11198s6i] |
| Mechanism | The pulsating descending aorta inhibits ipsilateral osteophyte formation, so DISH osteophytes often arise contralateral to the aorta [^113vVVYx] [^111teXMe] | Mechanical loading, aging, and genetic factors drive disc dehydration, height loss, and endplate remodeling with osteophytes [^114MXrs2] |
| Imaging | CT shows bulky anterior osteophytes bridging multiple levels, typically sparing disc height early; MRI shows low-signal ossified ligaments and osteophytes [^113jTsiD] | Radiographs/MRI show disc space narrowing, endplate sclerosis, and small horizontal osteophytes; MRI reveals disc dehydration and endplate changes [^113tozSu] |

---

## Clinical implications and complications

- **Pain and stiffness**: DISH and DDD can cause axial pain and stiffness, often mechanical and worse with inactivity [^113FQvM8] [^111uuqdH] [^111j9pMj].
- **Neurological symptoms**: Large osteophytes or disc collapse may compress the spinal cord or nerve roots, causing radiculopathy or myelopathy [^113MRvw3].
- **Vascular complications**: Contralateral osteophytes can erode or perforate the aorta, causing pseudoaneurysm or hemorrhage [^111teXMe] [^1149ycja] [^115QvEcx].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Osteophyte location** | **Disc space narrowing** | **Other features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| DISH | Contralateral to aorta | Typically preserved early | Flowing anterior osteophytes |
| DDD | Circumferential | Present | Small osteophytes, endplate sclerosis |
| Ankylosing spondylitis | Vertebral corners | Preserved early | Syndesmophytes, sacroiliitis |
| Degenerative spondylosis | Circumferential | Present | Facet arthropathy |

---

## Management strategies

- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications for pain and stiffness [^114WAf5G].
- **Surgical intervention**: Consider decompression or osteophyte removal for severe neurological symptoms or vascular risk [^113MRvw3] [^1149ycja].
- **Monitoring**: Regular imaging for progression or complications, especially vascular involvement [^notfound].

---

Bone spurs on the side opposite the aorta with disc space narrowing most likely reflect **DISH with coexisting DDD**, driven by aortic pulsation effects and mechanical degeneration, respectively.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: an evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with LSS have a history of symptoms that are notable for pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Patients with more pronounced LSS may develop lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and imbalance in gait. Patients typically report symptoms of neurogenic claudication that abate with sitting down or leaning forward, referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. As LSS is a slowly progressing condition, rapid onset of these symptoms may refer to a different pathology.

To confirm clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have a high sensitivity or specificity. There is great variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and lack of standardization may contribute to increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low cost and are readily available. Radiological AP and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may show segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes that are unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, renal stones, or calcified aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta, may also be identified. However, soft tissue evaluation using is limited. MRI has high sensitivity in diagnosing stenosis, as it has high soft tissue contrast, and it best depicts cord, nerve roots, and bone marrow abnormalities. Nevertheless, imaging should be correlated with clinical presentation, as many LSS imaging studies may not have a direct correlation with clinical presentation, and treatment options may vary. The physical findings that are most strongly linked to LSS include wide-based gait, normal Romberg test, thigh pain after 30 seconds of lumbar extension, and neuromuscular deficits. An expert consensus was obtained, which demonstrated an 80% certainty of LSS diagnosis based on seven history items, which include "leg/buttock pain while walking", "flex forward to relieve pain", "relief when using a shopping cart or bicycle", "motor/sensory", "disturbance while walking", "normal/symmetric foot pulses", "lower extremity weakness", and "low back pain". Based on physical examination, it is usually sufficient to diagnose for LSS, and MRI/CT diagnosis is often reserved for patients who are being considered for surgery after conservative management has failed.

### Unveiling the distinctive ossification patterns of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and ankylosing spondylitis using computed tomography three-dimensional reconstruction [^113vVVYx]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To quantitatively analyse the morphological characteristics of osteophytes in DISH and syndesmophytes in AS, and summarize different ossification patterns to help identify the two diseases. Associated factors for new bone formation would be investigated.

Methods

Fifty patients with DISH and 50 age-, sex-, CT examination site-matched patients with AS were enrolled. Radiographic and clinical data were reviewed. Osteophytes (syndesmophytes) in front of each vertebral body and the corresponding intervertebral disc space were defined as vertebral osteophytes unit (VOU). The volume, angle and location (contralateral, ipsilateral, bilateral) of osteophytes in each VOU were measured and compared between DISH and AS groups.

Results

In each VOU, the volume and angle of osteophytes in DISH were significantly larger. The best osteophytes volume and angle cutoff value in predicting DISH was 0.59cm3 and 40.15°. Contralateral, bilateral, ipsilateral osteophytes were recorded in 59.32%, 36.38%, 4.3% of assessed VOUs in patients with DISH and 64.78%, 29.31%, 5.91% in AS (P < 0.001), respectively. As to ipsilateral osteophytes, the volume was inversely correlated with the centre of the vertebral body to the centre of the descending aorta (DISH: r = -0.45, P = 0.01; AS: r = -0.83, P < 0.001). Advanced age, disease duration, smoking and overweight contribute to the progression of osteophytes and syndesmophytes.

Conclusion

Morphological features of osteophytes are helpful to distinguish DISH with AS. Aortic pulsations inhibit or hinder new bone formation in both DISH and AS. Maintaining normal BMI could postpone osteophytes formation.

### Osteophytes' position in subjects with DISH and right-sided aorta: verification of the 'aortic pulsation protective effect' theory [^111teXMe]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To validate in a large cohort with right-sided aorta the theory that thoracic right-sided flowing osteophytes in DISH results from a 'protective' effect of the pulsating descending left-sided thoracic aorta.

Methods

Chest CTs of patients with DISH and right-sided aorta and controls with DISH and left-sided aorta were evaluated and compared on each intervertebral space (IS) for the location of the aorta (right, left, centre) and the location of the osteophyte relative to the aorta (contralateral, ipsilateral, bilateral).

Results

The study and control cohorts included 31 and 35 subjects, respectively (male 22/9 and female 27/8; median age 64.8/65.3years; P = 0.86). Osteophytes contralateral to the aorta's location were recorded in the majority of ISs in both the study and control groups (47% and 60%, respectively; P > 0.05), while ipsilateral osteophytes were recorded in 6.9% and 7.7%, respectively (P = 0.002). Bilateral osteophytes located to the right and the left of the aorta were significantly more prevalent in the study group compared with the controls (17.2% and 5.4%, respectively; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Aortic pulsation plays an important role in inhibiting the development of osteophytes and results in the majority of contralateral osteophytes on both right-sided and left-sided aortas. However, since both ipsilateral and bilateral osteophytes were not at all rare in both groups, other parameters, which are yet to be established, probably contribute to the location of osteophytes.

New disease or disease progression

Imaging plays an essential role in evaluating new diseases or disease progression caused by lumbar spinal surgery. Symptomatic new or recurrent disc herniation, peri-/epidural fibrosis, neuroforaminal stenosis, arachnoiditis, and radiculitis are key causes of FBSS. FBSS may result from both successful and unsuccessful osseous fusions. Successful lumbar spinal surgery with osseous fusion results in altered biomechanics with hypermobility of adjacent levels, causing accelerated degenerative changes. Unsuccessful osseous fusion can result in pseudoarthrosis. Pseudoarthrosis rates are higher for anterior than posterior fusions. Findings of T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity persisting between the vertebral body and bone graft for more than 6 months are suggestive of pseudoarthrosis (Fig. 10). Heterotopic bone formation, which is increased with the use of osteobiologics, is best assessed on CT. It occurs in the ventrolateral epidural space after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and facet complex after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), resulting in central canal or foraminal stenosis, respectively. The degree of stenosis is best assessed on MRI (Fig. 11).

### A cadaver study evaluating intraluminal anomalies of the left common iliac vein [^1113TGDZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intraluminal anomalies within the left common iliac vein, characteristic of iliac vein compression syndrome, are thought to result from compression by and pulsation of the overlying right common iliac artery. This cadaver study was designed to expand on the existing literature by surveying and photographing these spurs in addition to exploring whether certain factors, inherent to the cadaver, are associated with spur presence.

Methods

Dissection to expose the aorta, inferior vena cava, and common iliac arteries and veins was performed in 51 cadavers. The spinal level at which the iliac vein confluence occurred was noted. The point at which the right common iliac artery crossed the left common iliac vein was examined for plaque presence. The overlying arterial structures were then transected to expose the venous system. The inferior vena cava was incised to facilitate observation into the mouth and full extent of the left common iliac vein. Spurs were photographed and documented. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether sex, body mass index (BMI), plaque presence, or level of the iliac vein confluence are associated with spur presence.

Results

Spurs within the left common iliac vein were observed in 16 of 51 cadavers (31.4%). All spurs were located at the point that the right common iliac artery crossed the left common iliac vein. Using1 the classification system established by McMurrich, 67% of spurs (n = 10) were marginal and triangular; 25% (n = 4) were columnar. One marginal, linear spur (6%) and one partially obstructed spur with multiple synechiae (6%) were observed. Among this population, males were 73% less likely to have a spur (odds ratio, 0.269; p = 0.041). No significant relationship was found between plaque presence and spur presence (odds ratio, 0.933; p = 0.824) and no significant differences were noted between BMI and spur presence (χ 2 = 1.752, P = .625). Last, a significantly greater percent of spurs was found within cadavers with an iliac vein confluence located at the L5/S1 disc space (χ 2 = 9.650; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Study findings show that spurs are more common when the confluence of the common iliac veins occurs at a lower spinal level. The level of the iliac vein confluence may be important in identifying patients at increased risk of venous disease. The findings also suggest that plaque within the right common iliac artery and BMI display no distinct relationship with spur presence. Further investigation is needed to understand exactly what factors lead to spur formation.

### Association of severe disc degeneration with all-cause mortality and abdominal aortic calcification assessed prospectively in older men: findings of a single-center prospective study of osteoporosis in men [^117ECj7w]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of disc degeneration with all-cause mortality and with the severity and rate of progression of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in older men.

Methods

Men > 50 years of age (n = 766) underwent lateral spine radiography and blood collection and were monitored prospectively. We assessed the association of disc degeneration with all-cause mortality (at 10 years), AAC severity (at baseline), and AAC progression (at 7.5 years).

Results

After adjustment for confounders, including AAC, the total overall grade score for AAC predicted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20 per SD increase [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01–1.43]). The highest tertile of the total overall grade score was associated with higher mortality rates (39.3/1,000 person-years for a score of > 8 versus 20.9/1,000 person-years for a score of 0–8; adjusted HR 1.47 [95% CI 1.05–2.06]). The odds of severe AAC (score of > 5) increased with the total disc space narrowing score (adjusted HR 1.44 per SD [95% CI 1.11–1.87]). The highest tertile of the total disc space narrowing score was associated with higher odds of severe AAC (adjusted HR 2.42 versus the lowest tertile [95% CI 1.24–4.73]). The probability of long-term AAC stability decreased with an increasing total osteophyte score (adjusted HR 0.66 per SD [95% CI 0.49–0.88]). The highest tertile of the total osteophyte score was associated with a lower probability of AAC stability (adjusted HR 0.35 versus the lowest tertile [95% CI 0.18–0.71]).

Conclusion

Older men with severe disc degeneration have greater AAC severity, faster AAC progression, and higher all-cause mortality rates.

### Older men with severe disc degeneration have more incident vertebral fractures-the prospective MINOS cohort study [^115wv1pS]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Data on the relationship between disc degeneration (DD) and fragility fractures in men are limited. The aim of this study was to prospectively analyse the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in men with thoracolumbar DD according to the severity of its radiological signs: disc space narrowing (DSN), osteophytes and endplate sclerosis.

Methods

Men > 50 years of age (n = 765) had lateral spine radiographs and DXA and were monitored prospectively. We analysed the risk of incident vertebral (7.5 years) and non-vertebral fractures (10 years) in men according to the severity of DD.

Results

After adjustment for age and weight, BMD increased with increasing total DSN score, endplate sclerosis and osteophytosis. Over 7.5 years, 28 incident vertebral fractures occurred in 27 men. After adjustment for age, BMI, spine BMD, prior fractures and abdominal aortic calcifications, the vertebral fracture risk was 3-fold higher in the upper DSN quartile vs men without DSN. After adjustment for the same confounders, vertebral fracture risk was also nearly 3-fold higher in the upper DSN quartile vs the three lower quartiles combined. Over 10 years, 61 men sustained non-vertebral fragility fractures. After adjustment for age, BMI, hip BMD, abdominal aortic calcifications and prior falls and fractures, the non-vertebral fracture risk decreased with increasing DSN score. The risk of non-vertebral fracture was half as high in men above the median total DSN score vs men below the median.

Conclusion

In older men, severe DD is associated with higher BMD. Multilevel severe DSN is associated with higher vertebral fracture risk and lower non-vertebral fracture risk.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^113rDrot]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Foraminal stenosis diagnosed by computed tomographic myelography (CTM) — In a retrospective case series of 95 patients with foraminal stenosis, CTM showed stenosis at the entrance in 70 (52%), within the canal itself in 37 (28%) and site not definitively identified in 27 (20%); at the entrance, stenosis secondary to a cartilaginous cap was identified in 10 patients (8%) and osteophyte in 17 (13%). Diagnosis on the basis of CTM was difficult, with stenosis evident as a bone spur in only 13% of cases, could not be distinguished from a disc herniation in 39%, had to be distinguished from a congenitally narrowed foramen in 27% and was missed in 20%; the study provides Level III diagnostic evidence that there is limited correlation between CT myelography and foraminal stenosis as confirmed by surgical exploration.

### Spatiotemporal changes in imaging features associated with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) [^113ZQwiu]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

A strength of the current study was the detailed evaluation of all motion segments in the thoracic spine using a validated scoring system. These findings enable us to put forward three suggestions to advance the field. First, we speculate that there may be unique patterns of bridging at specific regions of the spine that can facilitate early disease detection beyond the number of contiguous bridges. For example, the presence of complete bridging in the lower thoracic spine paired with involvement of early phases of ectopic bridging in upper regions of the spine. Second, we recommend modification of scoring systems to further categorise complete bridges based on morphological features instead of only completeness of bridging (eg, horizontal outgrowths vs flowing bands). There is value to include the well-characterised feature of ectopic mineralisation opposing the aorta (seen in axial images)in refined scoring systems of DISH. An improved understanding of morphological changes of ectopic mineralisation within individual motion segments may enhance detection of DISH across the continuum or identification of disease onset. Lastly, we postulate that additional features, such as the presence of localised nodules of mineralisation — documented by us and others — constitute important pathological features of DISH that should be considered.

### Acitretin [^115Cf2CD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

(See also boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.)

Skeletal Abnormalities

In adults receiving long-term treatment with acitretin, appropriate examinations should be periodically performed in view of possible ossification abnormalities (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Because the frequency and severity of iatrogenic bony abnormality in adults is low, periodic radiography is only warranted in the presence of symptoms or long-term use of acitretin. If such disorders arise, the continuation of therapy should be discussed with the patient on the basis of a careful risk/benefit analysis. In clinical trials with acitretin, subjects were prospectively evaluated for evidence of development or change in bony abnormalities of the vertebral column, knees, and ankles.

Of 380 subjects treated with acitretin, 15% had preexisting abnormalities of the spine which showed new changes or progression of preexisting findings. Changes included degenerative spurs, anterior bridging of spinal vertebrae, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, ligament calcification, and narrowing and destruction of a cervical disc space. De novo changes (formation of small spurs) were seen in 3 subjects after 1½ to 2½ years.

Six of 128 subjects treated with acitretin showed abnormalities in the knees and ankles before treatment that progressed during treatment. In 5, these changes involved the formation of additional spurs or enlargement of existing spurs. The sixth subject had degenerative joint disease which worsened. No subjects developed spurs de novo. Clinical complaints did not predict radiographic changes.

Myelography (including CT myelography and MRI myelography) — if there is a contraindication to MRI and surgery is considered moderate to high probability, then CT myelography is a consideration instead of CT followed by another CT with myelography. Myelography is recommended in uncommon situations, including contraindications for MRI such as implanted metal that preclude MRI, equivocal MRI findings of disc herniation, or suspected bone spurs, spinal stenosis, or other neurological compromise that requires myelography (Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), High Confidence).

### Deep learning based phenotyping of medical images improves power for gene discovery of complex disease [^114pEJQ6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For most complex disease traits, clinical endpoints are usually binary (case–control) in nature. In particular, data on disease outcomes from population-scale biobanks are only available through recorded ICD-10 billing codes or self-reported diagnosis –. While these datasets have provided invaluable insights into the genetic basis of disease, case ascertainment based solely on information available in the electronic health record (EHR) or from self-reports can be biased by a multitude of factors, including differences in how patients were billed, differential diagnosis due to assessment by clinicians (non-specialist vs specialist), or differences in classification or diagnosis based on disease severity.

An alternate approach to ascertaining disease status might be to directly perform clinical-grade assessment from a patient's medical images using a consistent diagnosis protocol. However, this is difficult to achieve at large scale such as in population biobanks where sample sizes range from hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals. For musculoskeletal diseases such as knee osteoarthritis (OA), radiography is the routine course of diagnosis in the clinic and the primary means to assess disease progression through sclerosis, osteophytosis (bone spurs), and narrowing of the space between the femur and tibia (knee joint space). For such radiographically diagnosed diseases, computer vision approaches for automated phenotyping based on training data from clinicians offer the potential to ascertain both case status and disease severity at scale. Such approaches have already been used for determining pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 cases from chest X-ray images, with reported accuracy even higher than expert radiologists based on ground truth from molecular information.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^114WAf5G]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Low back algorithm — evaluation of low back and back-related leg symptoms directs that patients with activity intolerance due to low back pain and/or back-related leg symptoms receive focused medical and work histories and physical examination to search for red flags, with neurologic screening and straight leg raising test and crossed SLR tests. If any red flags or symptoms of spinal stenosis, condition-specific actions are outlined: for dissecting or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, for low probability, sonography; for high probability, emergent CT or MRI scan; for spinal fracture, obtain plain-film radiography of lumbosacral spine, and if negative after 10 days and fracture still suspected or multiple sites of pain, obtain spiral CT, and consider consultation if result is positive or ambiguous; for cancer or infection, obtain CBC, ESR, U/A, note that in cancer or infection plain-film radiography may be negative, consider bone scan, and consultation if studies positive; and for cauda equina syndrome or rapidly progressing neurologic deficit, immediate consultation for studies and/or render definitive care. If symptoms of pseudoclaudication, treat with NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), progressive exercise, and surgery if severe or fails to improve sufficiently. In the absence of red flags, diagnostic testing is not helpful in the first 4 weeks for either low back or radicular pain; the algorithm then asks about evidence of serious disease with instruction to arrange appropriate treatment or consultation, and also about evidence of nonspinal problems causing back complaints.

### Endoscopic features for early decision to evaluate superior mesenteric artery syndrome in children [^115qsPtS]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to explore whether the EGD provides clue on early decision to perform a diagnostic test for SMAS. To the best of our knowledge, no study on the endoscopic features related to SMAS has yet been conducted. Our study suggests that endoscopy down to the third part of the duodenum can give a significant information in deciding to perform a diagnostic test for SMAS. The endoscopic clue in our study was a constellation of three findings including pulsating vertical or oblique band or slit like luminal narrowing of the third part of the duodenum with luminal expansion no more than one third during air insufflation over 15 s, proximal duodenal over distension during air insufflation in the third part of the duodenum, and bile lakes in the stomach.

SMA syndrome is a symptom complex disease caused by extrinsic compression of the third part of the duodenum due to narrowing of the aortomesenteric space (AMS) between the aorta and the SMA. Although the origin and route of the SMA are variable, it arises classically from the aorta at the level of intervertebral discs between vertebral level L1 and L2. The third part of the duodenum extends from the right side of L3 or L4 to the left side of the aorta and runs horizontally at the level of L3. Therefore, narrowing of aortomesenteric angle (AMA) and shortening of aortomesenteric distance (AMD) can compress the third part of the duodenum. Risk factors related to narrowing of AMA include high fixation of the duodenum by abnormally high insertion of the ligament of Treitz, abnormally low origin of the SMA, incomplete rotation of the duodenum, anomalies of the SMA, rapid linear growth with insufficient weight gain, rapid weight loss, and surgery for scoliosis. SMAS often develops in association with these risk factors but, up to 40% cases of SMAS occur without being related to these risk factors. Weight loss and low BMI are often reported in cases with SMAS, which can be not only clinical manifestations of SMAS, but also a consequence of poor oral intake due to symptoms related to SMAS. Weight loss and low BMI are not always identified in pediatric population with SMAS. In our study, no substantial differences were observed in number of cases of weight loss, BMI, and weight-for-height Z score between both groups (Tables 1, 2).

Lateral Recess

The lateral recess (aka the subarticular zone) is the outermost region of the spinal canal that is bordered laterally by the pedicle, posteriorly by the superior articular facet and LF, and anteriorly by the vertebral body, endplate and disc margin. This region is considered stenotic when AP measurement is < 4 mm. Nerve root compression in the lateral recess is also another important qualitative parameter in the radiological assessment for lateral recess stenosis. Due to the close proximity within the canal, stenosis in this region can lead to symptoms of radiculopathy due to nerve root compression with or without NC and can have a bilateral or unilateral presentation.

Foraminal

The neuroforamen is formed by the interpedicular osseous opening in which each spinal nerve root exits the dural sac passing through the lateral recess. The anterior anatomic boundaries of the intervertebral foramen include the adjacent superior-inferior vertebral pedicles, posteroinferior margin of the superior vertebral body, the intervertebral disc, and the posterosuperior margin of the inferior vertebral body, and the posterior anatomic boundaries include the LF and the superior and inferior articular facets. This region has three anatomical zones: internal, intraforaminal and extraforaminal. Degenerative changes such as hypertrophy and bone spurs from facet joints and bulging or herniated discs often contribute to foraminal stenosis. The neuroforamen are considered stenotic based on reduced perineural fat and/or reduced foraminal dimensions on MRI. A height less than 15 mm and a posterior disc height of 4 mm or less are associated with significant nerve root compression. Lumbar foraminal stenosis has a reported prevalence of 8% to 11%. Symptoms of pure foraminal stenosis typically are due to neural compression or neural irritation from an inflammatory cascade with a dermatomal distribution. Although no clinical finding is specific enough to suggest foraminal stenosis, patients often present with radicular leg pain and limited lumbar range of motion, particularly with extension. Low back pain, particularly in the buttock region, is often associated with foraminal stenosis.

Multistructural

Multistructural narrowing involving the central, lateral recess, and neuroforamen is the most frequently encountered LSS in those > 60 years old. The narrowing typically has a trefoil or cloverleaf appearance on axial cross-sections, in which all three regions of the spinal canal are narrowed. Symptoms are a combination of the above with nonspecific physical examination findings.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^113FnzNR]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical foraminal stenosis on computed tomography myelography (CTM) — surgically verified case series details and diagnostic limitations are reported as follows: Gold standard was surgical findings, with number of patients 95 and 134 stenotic foramina; patients were not consecutively assigned. CTM localized stenosis at the entrance in 70 (52%), within the canal itself in 37 (28%), and the site was not definitively identified in 27 (20%). At the entrance to the foramen, causes included a cartilagenous cap in 10 patients (8%), osteophyte in 17 (13%), synovial cyst in one, and a combination of bone and cartilagenous cap in 42 (31%). Within the canal, small bone spurs arose from the uncovertebral process in 29 instances and from the facet joint in 8. Diagnostic challenges were noted: stenosis was evident as a bone spur in only 13% of cases, could not be distinguished from a disc prolapse in 39%, required distinction from a congenitally narrowed foramen in 27%, and was missed in 20%. The authors concluded that the diagnosis of foraminal stenosis on CTM is difficult.

### Prevalence of degenerative changes and overlap with spondyloarthritis-associated lesions in the spine of patients from the DESIR cohort [^1166n7VV]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

On the radiographs, loss of disc height was defined as narrowing of the disc space in comparison with two adjacent (healthy) discs. By definition, the lumbar disc spaces should increase in height in the cranial to caudal direction, except disc L5–S1, which normally is smaller than disc L4–L5. Osteophytes, in the spine also called spondylophytes, are described by reactive bone hypertrophy, seen as bony spurs arising from the vertebral body close to the vertebral endplate in a horizontal configuration (maximum of 45-degree angle with the endplate). Sclerosis was defined by an increased bone density and calcification adjacent to the vertebral endplates. Schmorls nodes were defined as a radiolucent contour defect of the vertebral endplate with sclerotic margins. Facet joint osteoarthritis was defined as sclerotic joint surfaces and osteophyte formation.

Axial spondyloarthritis parameters

Initially, all images were read by the local radiologist and/or rheumatologist. In addition, two independent readers (MdH, J-BP) scored all images of all centres using the Berlin method and the Canada–Denmark for MRI and the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondyloarthritis Syndesmophyte Score (mSASSS) for radiographs. Data of the two readers were kept separate as we did not perform an adjudication for each individual lesion. From hereon we refer to this central reading as 'SpA reader 1' and 'SpA reader 2'. These readers were blinded for clinical information, the other modality and the scores of the other reader and the local reading. For the current study, we used bone marrow oedema (BME) lesions on MRI (from the Berlin score system), fatty corner lesion and corner and non-corner erosion on MRI (both from the Canada–Denmark scoring system) and syndesmophytes on radiographs (from the mSASSS) of SpA reader 1 and 2.

The aim of this paper is to describe the diagnostic value of the different radiological modifications of the intervertebral disk in children. Usual disk modifications include: disk-space narrowing; disk space enlargement; intervertebral disk calcifications; intervertebral disc prolapse; and signal modification in MRI. The gamuts (which are provided in the paper) of these different images must take into account the association with bone changes and the possibility of several disks' involvement.

### Active discopathy: a clinical reality [^112HF1WT]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

What is the primer for DDD activation?

Several factors including adverse biomechanical and biochemical factors may contribute to the activation of DDD, but the onset of active discopathy is most likely multifactorial. Although local inflammation is currently the main therapeutic target, it may be only a late-stage marker of disc disease activation. Other biochemical and metabolic factors, in addition to genetic and biomechanical predisposing factors, could participate in early stages of disc disease activation and be more relevant targets (figure 1).

Radiographic parameters

The following lesions were scored on radiographs. Disc height loss is defined as the narrowing of the disc space relative to two adjacent (healthy) discs. By definition, the lumbar disc spaces should increase in height in the cranial to caudal direction, except disc L5–S1, which normally is smaller than disc L4–L5. Osteophytes are characterised by reactive bone hypertrophy, seen as bony spurs arising from the vertebral body close to the vertebral endplate in a horizontal configuration. Sclerosis is defined as an increased bone density adjacent to the vertebral endplates. Facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) is defined as sclerotic joint surfaces and osteophyte formation. Schmorl's nodes are characterised by a radiolucent contour defect of the vertebral endplate with sclerotic margins. Spondylolisthesis is a condition that occurs when a vertebral body slips relative to the adjacent vertebral body because of spondylolysis (a congenital defect) or FJOA. It is graded according to the percentage of anterior translation with respect to the adjacent level on a three-point scale (grade I: a slip of less than one-third, grade II: a slip of up to two-thirds, grade III: a slip of more than two-thirds).

Prevalence of degenerative spinal lesions over 10Y

At baseline, 154 (53%) patients had at least one DL on radiographs, increasing to 207 (71%) at 10Y. The most frequent DLs on radiographs were disc height loss (baseline: 45% of patients, 10Y: 65%, net progression: +20%), followed by osteophytes (baseline: 21%, 10Y: 44%, net progression: +22%) and FJOA (baseline: 11%, 10Y: 24%, net progression: +13%) (Table 1). Only 6% (9/158) of patients had osteophytes without disc height loss at baseline; this figure was 8% (8/101) at 10Y. An average total number of 1.6 (2.5) DLs per patient was observed on radiographs at baseline; this number increased to 3.4 (3.9) at 10Y (p < 10 −4). It should be noted that the total number of DLs increased with age.

### Calcification in aortic stenosis: the skeleton key [^111dvfkB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is a common, potentially fatal condition that is set to become an increasing public health burden. Once symptoms develop, there is an inexorable deterioration with a poor prognosis. Despite this, there are no medical therapies capable of modifying disease progression, and the only available treatment is aortic valve replacement, to which not all patients are suited. Conventional teaching suggests that aortic stenosis is a degenerative condition whereby "wear and tear" leads to calcium deposition within the valve. Although mechanical stress and injury are important factors, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that aortic stenosis is instead governed by a highly complex, regulated pathological process with similarities to skeletal bone formation. This review discusses the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis with an emphasis on the emerging importance of calcification, how this can be visualized and monitored using noninvasive imaging, and how our improved knowledge may ultimately translate into novel disease-modifying treatments.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^1136sjvX]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — imaging studies and radiographic criteria: Imaging studies, specifically plain film radiographs, are confirmatory for moderate to severe hip OA; however, radiographs are less useful in demonstrating early osteoarthritic joint changes, and joint space narrowing detected on radiographs may be a relatively late stage phenomenon of OA. Joint space narrowing has been advocated as the best indicator and best predictor of arthritic change in patients with hip OA. The normal hip joint space is 3 to 5 mm, and a reduction of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm represents a clinically relevant and significant reduction in joint space width. Hip joint OA is considered moderate when joint space is less than 2.5 mm and severe when joint space is less than 1.5 mm. The development of newer imaging techniques, such as gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, has been suggested as a method to detect deficiencies in cartilage structure that may represent early arthritic changes in young patients. In addition to joint space narrowing, other criteria, including osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis, also are used to identify patients with hip OA, and the Kellgren/Lawrence scale has been used to classify degenerative findings associated with hip OA. The scale consists of 4 grades: grade 1, no radiographic evidence of OA; grade 2, doubtful narrowing of joint space and possible (minute) osteophytes; grade 3, moderate definite osteophytes, definite moderate narrowing of joint space; grade 4, large osteophytes, severe joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour; a potential caveat when using the Kellgren/Lawrence scale is spurs or osteophytes are emphasized and not all patients with hip OA have osteophytes.

### Active discopathy: a clinical reality [^11198s6i]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

What is active discopathy?

Degenerative disc disease

To understand active discopathy, we first describe 'non-active' disc disease, or DDD. At the macroscopic level, DDD affects the intervertebral disc and also the whole discovertebral complex. It is characterised by a fibrillar structure of the annulus fibrosus, cracks of the nucleus pulposus, thinning and erosions of the cartilaginous vertebral endplates, marginal osteophytosis and loss of disc height.DDD results from an imbalance in intervertebral disc homeostasis with quantitative and qualitative changes affecting intervertebral disc cells and extracellular matrix as well as decreased water content that impair the biomechanics of the intervertebral disc. At the molecular level, DDD is associated with local inflammatory processes characterised by immunological stimulation, neovascularisation and neoinnervation, accelerated cartilaginous and bone remodelling, and changes in lipid and oxidative metabolism. At the MRI level, the most consistently reported signs of DDD are nucleus pulposus dehydration, decreased disc height, disc bulging or hernia. Pfirrmann and colleagues described five MRI grades of DDD. The first grade corresponds to a normal intervertebral disc, and higher grades correspond to DDD and have in common a hypointense signal in T2-weighted sequences of a homogenous nucleus pulposus, with no distinction between the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, and loss of intervertebral disc height. However, no consistent anatomoclinical correlation between DDD and LBP has been described.

### Imaging of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) [^1112JhSb]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), is a condition characterised by calcification and ossification of ligaments and entheses. The condition usually affects the axial skeleton, in particular at the thoracic segment though also other portions of the spine are often involved. DISH often involves also peripheral tendinous and/or entheseal sites either alone, or in association with peripheral joints' involvement. At times, new bone formation involves the bone itself, but sometimes it involves joints not usually affected by osteoarthritis (OA), which result in bony enlargement of the epiphysis, joints space narrowing and a reduced range of motion. Because of the entheseal involvement, DISH can be mistaken for seronegative spondyloarthropathies or for a 'simple' OA. Furthermore, other implications for the recognition of DISH include spinal fractures, difficult intubation and upper endoscopies, decreased response rates in DISH with concomitant spondyloarthritides, and increased likelihood to be affected by metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. This atlas is intended to show the imaging finding in DISH in patients diagnosed with the condition by the Resnick classification criteria.

### Psoriatic arthritis and imaging [^117YXN1y]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has historically been considered a milder rheumatic disease not yielding significant clinical damage. However, recent studies have shown that PsA can be deforming and debilitating and that joint damage can be severe. Traditionally, joint damage has been recorded using plain radiographs. Characteristic radiographic features of PsA include joint erosions, joint space narrowing, bony proliferation including periarticular and shaft periostitis, osteolysis including "pencil in cup" deformity and acro-osteolysis, ankylosis, spur formation, and spondylitis. New imaging modalities, including ultrasound, bone scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging may help in both diagnosis and follow up of patients with PsA. These new imaging techniques will with validation help detect early changes in the peripheral joints, the periarticular tissues, and the spinal structures in patients with PsA.

### Degenerative disc disease in young adults with psoriatic arthritis [^1114BgYE]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to explore the prevalence of degenerative disc disease (DDD) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) aged < 50 years and to describe the factors associated with its development. We also examined the association between radiographic axial imaging findings and inflammatory back pain (IBP) and mechanical back pain.

Methods

We included patients with PsA aged < 50 years who were followed at our prospective observational cohort. We defined DDD as intervertebral disc space narrowing, spur formation, facet joint arthrosis, and spondylolisthesis on anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs of the cervical and thoracolumbar spine. To identify factors associated with the development of DDD, we used multivariate Cox regression analysis. We used generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to test the association between imaging findings (isolated DDD, isolated axial disease, and both) and the type of back pain.

Results

Of 814 patients included in the study, 316 (38.8%) were observed to have DDD on plain radiographs of the spine. Factors associated with the development of DDD included older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, P < 0.01), male sex (HR 1.52, P = 0.03), diabetes mellitus (HR 2.35, P = 0.045), and IBP (HR 2.03, P < 0.01). Being employed (vs unemployed), higher BMI, calcaneal spurs, and targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drug use showed a trending association with DDD. In the GEE analysis, none of the abnormal imaging findings were significantly associated with back pain or IBP.

Conclusion

DDD is common in young patients with PsA, and its development may be associated with demographic features, comorbidities, and disease-related factors. IBP does not reliably distinguish between axial PsA and DDD.

### Association between metabolic syndrome and radiographic changes in psoriatic arthritis: a cohort study [^112A1L1v]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Multivariate GEE analysis identified plantar and/or Achilles calcaneal spurs, DISH, and DDD (cervical and thoracolumbar) as radiographic features independently associated with MetS in patients with PsA but not radiographic damage to peripheral joints, sacroiliitis, or syndesmophytes. This is not unexpected because these radiographic findings share with MetS the close relation to aging, degenerative disease, and metabolic changes. Although not characteristic radiographic disease features of PsA, both DISH and DDD may occur in patients with psoriatic disease. In a previous study, we demonstrated an association between DISH and the presence of radiographic damage to peripheral joints. Calcaneal spurs, although commonly secondary to degenerative disease, may also represent enthesophytic manifestation of PsA. Thus, although MetS is associated with higher PsA disease activity, it is not associated with higher PsA‐related radiographic damage to axial or peripheral joints.

It should be emphasized that factors associated with MetS, such as higher BMI and lower physical activity, are modifiable; tight control and healthy lifestyle changes can result in favorable health‐related outcomes, especially in the cardiovascular domain. In PsA, weight loss was shown to be associated with a higher rate of minimal disease activity in patients with overweight or obesity taking TNFi. Klingberg et alfound that short‐term weight loss treatment with a very low energy diet correlated favorably with disease activity in joints, entheses, and skin in patients with PsA and obesity.

Our study has several strengths, including the large number of patients, the organized and well‐documented nature of the follow‐up, and detailed clinical and radiographic data. We do acknowledge some limitations, including the retrospective design and that it was conducted at a single center.

In conclusion, MetS was not associated with more severe peripheral or axial radiographic damage in our study. On the other hand, it was found to be associated with metabolic and degenerative changes in the spine and entheses, most likely due to shared underlying pathomechanisms. These imaging changes, although not being inherent radiographic features of PsA, may have untoward impacts on patient symptoms and quality of life. The relationship between MetS and PsA, and potential mitigating strategies, merit further investigation.

### Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy in stable degenerative lumbar isthmic spondylolisthesis with radicular leg pain: a retrospective study [^111WakhX]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

An additional benefit of PTELF technology is the use of local anesthesia. With an average patient age of 65.2 years, including 14 patients aged ≥ 65 years, and common comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases in 12 patients (48%), endocrinology diseases (20%) in six, and no comorbidities in eight, PTELF proves advantageous for both young and older patients with comorbidities or those unable to tolerate general anesthesia. Furthermore, PTELF under local anesthesia reduces the risk of nerve injury, as the surgeon can communicate with the patient to judge and assess their condition. Compared to other endoscopic or open surgeries requiring general anesthesia, PTELF under local anesthesia is relatively safe and facilitates fast postoperative recovery.

PTELF technology addresses the bony compression leading to FS and adverse pathology in and around the foramen; it further focuses on restoring the dual nerve root activity. After a comprehensive review and analysis of 23 endoscopic videos, unique patterns were identified in the growth of bone spurs. Most of them extended from the proximal lamina stump to the extraforaminal exit zone, constituting the primary bone factors affecting the ENR. Furthermore, small coarse bone spurs were unevenly distributed along the lateral boundary of the lamina to the inner side and the top part of the lamina, covering the foramen around the ENR. As spondylolisthesis progresses, these pathological bones may impact the ENR, especially in the narrowest position between the ENR and the top of the foramen. Furthermore, the accumulation of fibrocartilage and scar tissue around the isthmus fracture gap could occupy the space in the spinal canal and neural foramen, aggravating the spatial compression effect on the nerve. Therefore, a crucial step in PTELF involves the meticulous and alternating use of endoscopic bone knives and forceps to remove various kinds of bone spurs and scars, with a focus on carving around the ENR until the starting point of the ENR (the axillary epidural zone) is exposed. Among the observed cases, 15 involved DH, classified according to Kim's method, with 11 being foraminal, three extraforaminal, and one posterolateral. Patients with this pathology typically experience severe RLP. Therefore, although leg pain may be partially relieved after bone decompression, a careful examination is crucial until the nerve roots move freely. Simply exposing the nerve roots is insufficient and may lead to overlooking certain areas of DH. In nine cases, the main compression was attributed to LVE. As spondylolisthesis progresses and intervertebral disc height is lost, the anatomical structure of the foramen in late DLIS differs from that in typical FS cases. The LVE may become a pathological factor exacerbating FS rather than the SAP. The ENR becomes sandwiched between the pedicle and the LVE. Therefore, removing the LVE and grinding off a portion of the upper pedicle is necessary to enlarge the space at the bottom and top of the ENR. This classification is based on the primary compression factors of nerve roots observed in the videos, acknowledging its subjective and inaccurate nature. However, it offers theoretical guidance for decompression, aiding the operator in better judging the endpoint of decompression by addressing each pathology individually and preventing the oversight of specific details.

### Active discopathy: a clinical reality [^116z4kVy]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Limits of the concept

Even though the concept of active discopathy could now be defined as a syndrome characterised by DDD associated with MRI, clinical and biological signs of activation, its reality and clinical relevance remain controversial among spine researchersand its pathogenesis unclear. How DDD activates and how disc disease activation actually self-limits remains largely unanswered. Even though there are some similarities between osteoarthritis and DDD and between inflammatory flare of peripheral osteoarthritis and active discopathy, we agree that the lack of synovial tissue in spine may differentiate the physiopathology of these diseases.

### Imaging review of the atypical spinal epidural space pathologies [^112aV1Ug]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathologies affecting the spinal epidural space (SES) comprise various abnormalities. However, they all have the potential to cause thecal sac narrowing or spinal cord compression. In this review, we group these pathologies into degenerative, infective, neoplastic, vascular, traumatic, and others, focusing on their imaging features. Degenerative pathologies of the SES range from disc to facet disease, with a particular emphasis on the less common degenerative pathologies in this review. Infective pathologies affecting the epidural space include spondylodiscitis and associated epidural phlegmon and abscess. Neoplasms arising from typical SES components include neurofibroma, hemangioma, and liposarcoma. MRI is the best modality to assess the anatomy and abnormalities of the epidural space. MRI, combined with computed tomography, or a radiograph, is useful for the evaluation of bones or radiopaque foreign bodies.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^111j9pMj]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

Conservative treatment is considered a first-line treatment for the majority of patients with degenerative spine disease, unless the disease presents with acute neurological symptoms such as myelopathy or cauda equine syndrome. When medical therapy fails, imaging and spinal surgery are considered as the next step of management. Depending on the prevalent degenerative pattern, different surgical approaches can be utilised. Patients with symptomatic disc herniations can benefit from microdiscectomy. If a degenerative process results in destabilisation and abnormal spinal motion, different types of surgical fusion can be used to stabilise the spine. Interbody fusion implants are widely used to restore disc height and support the anterior column. Spondylotic changes usually do not require surgery (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
Surgical treatment options for degenerative changes. (a) Herniations. Herniations are often associated with pain and neurological symptoms and most commonly occur on the lumbar spine. Treatment options include conservative treatment if the herniation does not compress the nerves and surgical removal of the herniation if neural compression exists. (b) Spondylosis. Chronic longstanding disc degeneration results in slowly progressive mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and gradual osteophyte formation without apparent disc displacement. Spondylosis is considered an adaptive reaction to stabilise motion in the presence of instability or a compensatory mechanism to limit the range of motion and prevent further degeneration. Altered disc biomechanics and narrowed intervertebral disc space subsequently lead to facet joint degeneration. This is probably the most favourable type of degeneration as it is essentially asymptomatic, may be seen at all levels of the spine and typically does not require treatment. (c) Disc collapse. Disc collapse leads to annular folding, anterior bulging of the flaval ligaments and posterior bulging of the posterior longitudinal ligament, with consequential narrowing of the central spinal canal. The decreasing disc height of the involved spinal segment leads to increased stiffness and may cause vertical degeneration of the adjacent vertebral segments. (d) Progressive structural failure of the disc to maintain the integrity of the functional spinal unit leads to segmental instability. This may progress to degenerative spondylolysthesis and require spinal instrumentation

There are some limitations inherent to our cross-sectional design — the most obvious of which is that causation cannot be derived from the data. We also cannot rule out the possibility that those with tandem thoracic degeneration involving the cervical and/or the lumbar segment started out with isolated thoracic degeneration only, and progressed to involve the cervical and lumbar segments as well, as a manifestation of age-related DD. This leads to an underestimation of the prevalence of isolated thoracic degeneration as may be seen with a 4% prevalence. The design and approach of this work remain exploratory and findings should be seen as hypothesis-generating.

Cross-sectional spinal imaging is common, and extraspinal findings are often incidentally identified during interpretation. Although some of these findings may cause symptoms that mimic a spinal disorder, the majority are entirely asymptomatic and incidental. It is essential that the radiologist not only identify those abnormalities that may have clinical significance but also recognize those that are clinically irrelevant and thereby prevent patients from being subjected to further unnecessary, expensive and potentially harmful interventions. This article focuses on those abnormalities that are commonly encountered and provides practical guidance for follow-up and management based on current recommendations.

### Disc degeneration-related clinical phenotypes [^115J7WoK]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The phenotype, or observable trait of interest, is at the core of studies identifying associated genetic variants and their functional pathways, as well as diagnostics. Yet, despite remarkable technological developments in genotyping and progress in genetic research, relatively little attention has been paid to the equally important issue of phenotype. This is especially true for disc degeneration-related disorders, and the concept of degenerative disc disease, in particular, where there is little consensus or uniformity of definition. Greater attention and rigour are clearly needed in the development of disc degeneration-related clinical phenotypes if we are to see more rapid advancements in knowledge of this area. When selecting phenotypes, a basic decision is whether to focus directly on the complex clinical phenotype (e.g. the clinical syndrome of spinal stenosis), which is ultimately of interest, or an intermediate phenotype (e.g. dural sac cross-sectional area). While both have advantages, it cannot be assumed that associated gene variants will be similarly relevant to both. Among other considerations are factors influencing phenotype identification, comorbidities that are often present, and measurement issues. Genodisc, the European research consortium project on disc-related clinical pathologies has adopted a strategy that will allow for the careful characterisation and examination of both the complex clinical phenotypes of interest and their components.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^11177gSD]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Evaluation of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis

There are no widely accepted gold standard diagnosis criteria for LSS, but the presence of imaging showing narrowing of the spinal neural structure is a necessary finding. Confirmatory diagnosis typically consists of assessing history, physical examination, and radiographic images. History should be consistent with pain while standing or walking that is relieved by forward flexion or sitting. Typical clinical features include lower extremity pain with equivocal straight leg raise testing and softs signs of radiculopathy. In many cases, the physical examination is normal while sitting, including reflexes, strength, and sensation. Imaging showing disc bulging, loss of disc height, facet joint arthropathy, osteophyte formation, and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy can lead to narrowing of the spinal canal. With the extension of the spine, the laminar edges of adjacent vertebral bodies overlap with relaxation and inward buckling of the ligamentum flavum, along with the movement of the superior facets in a rostral-anterior direction. Neurogenic claudication occurs as a result of ischemia (due to venous congestion and diminished arterial blood flow) or mechanical compression of nerve roots and is defined by pain or radiculopathy in the buttocks and/or lower extremities that worsens with walking and improves with forward bending or sitting. Walking may additionally exacerbate symptoms, as the demand for increase in oxygen in the spinal nerve roots may exceed the available blood flow.

Spinal canal narrowing might also be exacerbated by the shifting of one vertebral body anteriorly or posteriorly, relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This condition is known as spondylolisthesis. The lumbosacral joint is exposed to extensive anterior-directed shear forces. The paired facet joints, pars interarticularis, and intervertebral discs are the main anatomical structures that are subjected to these forces. Degenerative spondylolisthesis occurs due to the aging process. It is associated with the occurrence of marked facet joint arthritis with rotatory vertebral slip and occurs most frequently at L4–5, although it can be seen at other levels. Isthmic spondylolisthesis occurs due to a defect in the pars interarticularis (whether congenital or acquired) and occurs most often at L5-S1. In isthmic spondylolisthesis, the intervertebral disc preserves the stability of the spinal segment. Once disc degeneration occurs, the main source of stability is lost and the vertebral slip increases. This is an important differentiating factor when determining treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Vertebral bone quality score as a predictor of pedicle screw loosening following surgery for degenerative lumbar disease [^112Joc7f]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show that an MRI-based assessment of bone quality is associated with pedicle screw loosening. In addition, we found that screw loosening was associated with age, range of fixation, LIV, and HU value. These results are consistent with those of previous studies.,

Conventionally, the most common tool for the evaluation of BMD is DXA. In patients with degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine, DXA is often unable to accurately assess the BMD of the cancellous bone of the vertebral body, due to osteophyte formation, degeneration of vertebral facet joints, osteosclerosis, and aortic calcification. Consequently, alternative radiographic measures, such as the HU value of computed tomography images, have been explored for the evaluation of BMD. The HU value can not only select the ROI for measurement but also has a positive correlation with BMD.

More recently, opportunistic bone quality screening has been explored using lumbar MRIs, which are obtained at increasing rates due to the high prevalence of low-back pain among the aging population. – The first method was described as the M -score, which is an SI measurement of the lumbar trabecular bone on a T1-weighted MRI. Previous studies have shown that when a bone becomes osteoporotic, local fat cells replace bone trabeculae, weakening the overall bone structure. The M -score is one of the tools that utilizes the observation that adipose tissue has a high T1 signal and the assumption that fatty infiltration of the vertebral cancellous bone can be assessed by measuring the T1 signal of trabecular bone. A subsequent study validated this method, providing evidence for the effectiveness of the M -score for assessing bone quality. However, the use of the M -score is limited, because all of the scores must be obtained on the same MRI machine. Using a similar principle, and the fundamentals of the M -score, the VBQ score was developed.CSF SI at the L3 space is used as the reference value and therefore, scores can be compared across patients measured by different MRI machines. The VBQ score is both an independent predictor of fragility fractures in at-risk patients and a superior predictor of fracture risk than DXA-measured BMD.

### Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): where we are now and where to go next [^113jTsiD]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Key messages

Although diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is known for its radiographic characteristics, there are limited data about its clinical manifestations, aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment.
This article highlights the limitations of our understanding of this entity.
Understanding of the early bony changes might lead to early diagnosis and eventually to more targeted therapy.
Much needed future research paths are suggested.

Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a systemic, relatively common condition, with an average prevalence of approximately 10% in people > 50 years of age. Despite its old characterisation (previously described as 'ankylosing hyperostosis' by Forestier and Rotes-Querol), DISH is still insufficiently investigated and understood. The disease is characterised by continuous ossification of ligaments and entheses, especially in the axial skeleton but also in peripheral joints. Classification of DISH is being made when large bridging osteophytes occur in at least four adjacent thoracic vertebrae, as detected by conventional radiographs. Indeed, the disease usually affects the thoracic spine, without further explanation for this preference in location but other spinal segments or peripheral joints might also be affected. In contrast to the impressive structural changes, patients with DISH may be largely asymptomatic. This is also one of the reasons why this condition has not received as much attention from both clinicians and researchers due to its difficulty for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, the role of DISH as a condition associated with many systemic conditions such as underlying metabolic derangements or cardiovascular disease has been confirmed in clinical studies in the last decades. However, it remains to be established if, and to what extent, DISH is an independent cardiovascular risk factor.

Study Design

Case report and review of literature.

Objective

To highlight the specific features of a rare, life-threatening, clinical picture.

Summary Of Background Data

Vertebral erosion (VE) is rarely associated with contained rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The involvement of radicular nerves can mimic a discus hernia syndrome; eventually vertebral erosion induces isolated lower back pain. These features often lead to a delayed or wrong diagnosis of a life-threatening condition. Forty-two complete similar case reports have been published in the English literature since 1962. The most prevalent symptoms are low back pain and neurological signs due to compression of radicular nerves.

Methods

A 73-year-old man presented to Vascular Surgery department complaining of continuous pain in the lumbar region during the previous 6 months. The duplex examination revealed a huge infrarenal aortic aneurysm with an undefined posterior wall. Spiral CT and MR scan confirmed the aneurysm and a scalloping of the second and third lumbar vertebral bodies.

Results

A double-team intervention, vascular and orthopedic, consisted in aneurysm graft replacement; vertebral bodies excision and anterior and posterior spinal stabilization. Postoperatively the patient experienced reversible respiratory and renal failure and was discharged home in good health after 30 days.

Conclusion

The presence of aortic abdominal aneurysm is always to be considered in the evaluation of an elderly patient complaining lower back pain or lower limb neuropathy of recent onset, especially in the presence of a degenerative process of the spine.

The lateral skull had frontal calvarial thickening and sclerosis producing frontal bossing. The parietal, temporal, and occipital bones were largely spared, with only minimally increased radiodensity, but the normal intramedullary space was absent throughout the calvarium. Limited visualization of the facial bones showed no sclerosis or deformity.

Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed a common pattern of abnormality involving the entirety of every vertebral segment. The vertebral bodies were diffusely radiodense, with thickening of the cortex of both the vertebral body proper and the posterior elements. However, there was minimal enlargement of the vertebral bodies themselves and only moderate expansion of the posterior elements. A common pattern of marked trabecular thickening was present within the medullary space of the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements, producing coarse, thick, vertically oriented trabeculae in a pattern reminiscent of vertebral hemangiomas. The cortical and trabecular changes were not associated with significant scoliosis or kyphosis, and the intervertebral disk spaces in the cervical and thoracic spine remained normal. Disk narrowing indicative of disk degeneration was noted at L 4 -L 5 and L 5 -S 1. No evidence of marginal spurring or facet arthritis was present. There was no indication of spondyloarthritis.

A chest radiograph from 2001 also revealed diffuse osteosclerosis. There was no indication of active cardiopulmonary disease. Cortical and trabecular thickening was present throughout the ribs, which were uniformly expanded. The vertebral bodies were not enlarged, but they showed similar thickening of the cortices and trabeculae. The findings in 2001 were unchanged in 2007.

Anteroposterior radiographs of the scapulae and pelvis, including the sacrum, showed changes similar to the spine with mild, diffuse bone expansion and cortical and trabecular thickening. The thickened trabeculae followed normal stress line patterns and were not as disorganized as typically seen in Paget bone disease. Marked cortical thickening and uniform sclerosis was particularly prominent in the superior and inferior pubic rami, without the cortical splitting or "tram-tracking" of Paget bone disease. Cartilage loss and spurring were present in both hips, indicating moderate hip osteoarthritis.

Degenerative changes of the spine may involve the disc space, the facet joints, or the supportive and surrounding soft tissues. MR imaging is ideally suited for delineating the presence, extent, and complications of degenerative spinal disease. Other imaging modalities such as radiography, myelography, and CT may provide complimentary information in selected cases. Percutaneous procedures may be used to confirm that a morphologic abnormality is the source of symptoms. Correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic data is also helpful for accurate diagnosis. Combining the information obtained from imaging studies with the patient's clinical presentation is mandatory for determining the appropriate patient management strategy, especially true in patients afflicted with any condition directly attributed to the degenerative processes of the spine.

Anterior Spine vs Posterior Elements

The biomechanics of the spine depend on the pattern of stress on the vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and ligamentous structures during flexion, extension, rotations, and bending. Each vertebra consists of three columns: the anterior column, middle column, and posterior column. The anterior column carries the axial load and resists extension. It consists of the anterior longitudinal ligament, anterior two-thirds of the vertebral body, and annulus fibrosus. The middle column ensures resistance to flexion and carries a part of the axial load. It consists of the posterior longitudinal ligament, posterior third of the vertebral bodies, annulus fibrosis, and nucleus pulposus. The posterior column ensures resistance to flexion and provides stability during rotation and lateral bending. It consists of the pedicles, facet joints, ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligaments, and supraspinous ligaments.

The anterior spine consists of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs protected by strong annulus fibrosus and cartilaginous endplates above and below. The intervertebral discs (IVDs) are the largest avascular structures in the body, and the nutrition of the discs is by diffusion from endplates. Progressive degenerative process may involve endplates, further decreasing nutrition and enhancing dehydrogenation of discs, and eventually triggering the most common progressive disability, degenerative disc disease. Even though the etiology of DDD is poorly understood, it is widely accepted that the aging process promotes dehydration by decreasing the water content of the IVDs. Genetic factors based on twin studies and mice knockout studies, along with environmental factors including overuse injuries, falls, smoking, and obesity, have been identified as contributing factors to DDD.

The presence of a stenotic spinal canal on MRI is not diagnostic of LSS due to poor correlation to symptomatology. There is no significant correlation between the area of the dural sac and clinical symptoms of spinal stenosis. Clinical diagnosis becomes more challenging due to overlapping symptomatology in degenerative LSS, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and peripheral neuropathy. Leg pain and back pain seem to be the primary symptoms of LSS; however, pain and numbness in the leg are also reported as primary symptoms of LSS. Weakness of the lower extremities, sensory changes, areflexia, and bladder or bowel incontinence are symptoms of advanced LSS. Therefore, difficulties in walking and deformity of the lower extremities can be results of the neurological abnormality effects of LSS.

### Hip osteoarthritis: what the radiologist wants to know [^1159Ksvf]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease of the hip joint seen in adults. The diagnosis of OA is based on a combination of radiographic findings of joint degeneration and characteristic subjective symptoms. The lack of a radiographic consensus definition has resulted in a variation of the published incidences and prevalence of OA. The chronological sequence of degeneration includes the following plain radiographic findings: joint space narrowing, development of osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cyst formation. There are cases though, that plain radiographs show minor changes and the clinical suspicion of early disease can be confirmed with more sophisticated imaging methods, such as multi-detector computed tomography and MR imaging. The present article will review all the clinical information on the hip OA together with an updated radiological approach, with emphasis on the early depiction and the differential diagnosis of the disease.

### Association between metabolic syndrome and radiographic changes in psoriatic arthritis: a cohort study [^111TvK44]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a known comorbidity of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and is associated with PsA disease activity. We aimed to explore the association between MetS and radiographic features (peripheral and axial) in PsA.

Methods

We included patients with PsA followed at our prospective observational cohort for the period between 1978 and 2024. We identified patients with MetS on longitudinal follow‐up and used generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis to define the radiographic features independently associated with MetS, adjusting for age, sex, PsA disease duration, calendar decade, and use of targeted disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Results

The study population consisted of 1,422 patients, out of which 400 (28.1%) had MetS at baseline (clinic entry) and 836 (58.79%) had a record of MetS (per the harmonized definition) over a median follow‐up duration of 10.59 (interquartile range 4.52–18.28) years. The mean (SD) age of our cohort at baseline was 44.43 (12.98) years, with 789 patients (55.5%) identifying as men. Mean (SD) body mass index was 28.79 (6.36) kg/m 2. In the GEE analysis, MetS was not significantly associated with axial disease or radiographic damage to peripheral joints, assessed as the presence of syndesmophytes or sacroiliitis and the radiographic damaged joint count, respectively. On the other hand, MetS was significantly associated with calcaneal spurs, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, and degenerative disc disease.

Conclusion

MetS is associated with degenerative and metabolic changes in the spine and entheses but not with radiographic damage in PsA.

Differential lesion examples in the coronal (A–C) and sagittal (D–E) planes in an HLA-B27 positive 69-year-old male patient with 24 years of inflammatory back pain symptom duration and radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). In these representative examples, vertical bony outgrowths typical of syndesmophytes (arrow) are present along with large non-marginal, and horizontal to the endplate lesions, flowing at the anterior longitudinal ligaments, consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (arrowhead). There is a right convex lumbar scoliosis with secondary degenerative changes: disc space loss, irregularity of endplates and (excessive) spondylophyte formation. In addition, there is spondylosis at multiple thoracic levels, with preservation of the intervertebral disc space (IDS). The dashed arrows show an example of a bone spur that initially started horizontally then grows vertically to the endplate; the atypical orientation together with the coexistence of degenerative changes of the endplate and IDS imposes caution in the classification of this structure as a syndesmophyte indicative of axSpA. These images mark the necessity to view all slices in two planes together with clinical findings such as age and disease duration (if available) in order not to misinterpret degeneration for axSpA.

### Human heterozygous ENPP1 deficiency is associated with early onset osteoporosis, a phenotype recapitulated in a mouse model of enpp1 deficiency [^112gEkt2]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ENPP1 deficiency in humans is associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), a rare and often fatal neonatal calcification disorder characterized by arterial calcifications in the medium and large arteries. GACI may begin as early as the late second trimester and culminates in death in affected infants around 6 months of age in about 50% to 60% of patients. The calcifications arise as a consequence of the generalized deficiency of pyrophosphate 1 resulting from biallelic mutations that inactivate the genes encoding either the ectoenzyme ENPP1 2 (type 1, about 75% of patients), which hydrolyzes ATP to generate pyrophosphate, or ABCC6 3, 4 (type 2, about 25% of patients), a transmembrane protein that when mutated results in low plasma pyrophosphate (PPi). If affected individuals reach the age of 6 months they are likely to survive and over time may experience spontaneous reversal of vascular calcifications, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but severe vascular narrowing may persist along with the development of skeletal deformities described below.

Children with ENPP1 deficiency may manifest a form of hypophosphatemic rickets (autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 [ARHR2]) whether or not they previously had arterial calcifications. The bone disease in ARHR2 may be severe and symptomatic, leading to repeated fractures of the long bones, rachitic skeletal deformities, and impaired growth and development. 10, 11 In ARHR2, elevated serum levels of FGF23 and consequent renal phosphate wasting leading to hypophosphatemia are thought to lead to the rachitic phenotype, but the relationship between ENPP1 deficiency, plasma PPi and FGF23 levels, and their contribution to skeletal pathology is not yet understood.

Systematic studies of ENPP1 deficiency in adults are unavailable, but sporadic case reports of adults with homozygous ENPP1 deficiency document a history of childhood hypophosphatemic rickets and the development of polyarthralgias as adults 12 along with progressive calcifications in the anterior and/or posterior spinal ligaments. 12, 13, 14 The dual phenotypes of spinal calcifications and hypophosphatemic rickets often lead to presumptive diagnoses of XLH and/or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) until genetic analysis confirming ENPP1 deficiency is performed.

Supernumerary rib syndrome

Also known as accessory or "Eve's rib", the supernumerary rib usually originates from the seventh cervical vertebra and articulates with a transverse cervical process. Occurring in 0.5% of the population, it is often asymptomatic. It varies in size and is distinguished from the second true rib at the manubriosternal joint. Diagnosis is made on imaging, although it may be supported by symptoms such as ipsilateral arm pain, edema, or altered pulses. Supernumerary ribs may cause thoracic outlet syndrome with vascular and neurogenic compression, including numbness, paresthesia, or weakness in the upper limb.

Radiological features.

Ultrasound and tomographic imaging are performed with the patient's arms in neutral (adducted) and elevated (abducted) positions (Fig. 3). MRI is useful for assessing the involvement of neurogenic structures as the edema surrounding the brachial plexus and the loss of surrounding fatty tissue. Venous involvement may consist of subclavian-axillary venous thrombosis, collateral compensation circles, stenosis, and narrowing of the venous vessel. Arterial involvement consists of axillary-subclavian aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms, arterial thrombus, distal emboli, collaterals, and vessel narrowing.

They show the supernumerary rib, which causes the development of a thoracic outlet syndrome (white arrows in a — axial view and soft tissue window, and b — coronal view with bone window). c and f also demonstrate partial thrombosis of the subclavian artery (white arrowheads)

Poland syndrome

This is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by total or partial absence of the pectoralis major and ipsilateral syndactyly, often associated with, absence or atrophy of ribs, pectoralis minor, and nipple or breast aplasia.

Radiological features.

Chest X-ray shows hypodiaphany emulating a mastectomy. CT scan defines better muscle abnormality and associated musculoskeletal defects, while ultrasound estimates the degree of muscle atrophy (Fig. 4). Finally, mammography may help in differential diagnosis.

Vertebral fractures

Vertebral fractures of the thoracic tract are often the result of blunt trauma such as motor vehicle accidents. The thoracic vertebral tract, compared to the lumbar, is stiffer and requires more energy to cause trauma. The thoracolumbar junction is the most frequent fracture zone as a result of the high mobility of this tract.

Radiological features.

Vertebral fractures include compression, burst, posterior column, flexion-distraction (seatbelt- "Chance Fractures"), fracture-luxation, translation-rotation, and transverse process fractures. Classifications include AO, Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (TLICS), and Genant. Elements that lean toward the neoplastic form are: total bone destruction visible on CT scan, signal alterations in the vertebral soma on MRI, epidural or paraspinal masses, concomitant vertebral metastases, bulging of the vertebral cortical bone in the canal with involvement of the medullary canal (Fig. 7s).

Degenerative disc disease and arthrosis

Arthrosis is a widespread pathology with high morbidity and social costs. It is classified into: primary (idiopathic) and secondary (post-traumatic, post-surgical, occupational stress, obesity, etc.).

Radiological features.

The main radiographic features are joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytosis. Others include: joint space narrowing (asymmetrical), joint erosion (typical of the acromioclavicular joint in the thoracic location), subchondral cysts, bone marrow lesions visible on MRI as edema appearance, and synovitis.

Degenerative disc disease is related to biomechanical stresses and genetic predisposition, which alter the metabolic and structural integrity of the intervertebral disc.

Radiological features.

Disc abnormalities are subdivided into: bulging of the annulus and herniation with displacement of intervertebral disc material beyond the disc edges (protrusion, extrusion or sequestration). For the study of the spine, MRI remains the gold standard with sagittal T1 fast spin-echo (FSE), sagittal and axial T2 STIR sequences with T1-weighting and suppression of adipose tissue (in sagittal projection) and T2 gradient echo sequences (axial).

Chest wall tumors

Chest wall tumors may develop from lymphatic tissues, fat, nerves, vessels, cartilage, and bone. They have been classified as primary and secondary chest wall tumors. Chest wall tumors have also been classified as malignant lesions, which include mainly sarcomas (chondrosarcoma in adults and Ewing's sarcoma among adolescents), and benign neoplasms, mostly represented by chondroma and lipoma.

### Aortic valve calcification: a bone of contention [^114YWioJ]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Interdisciplinary research approaches have revealed new insights into the pathogenesis of aortic valve calcification. In particular, they have led to the discovery that calcific lesions contain unique, highly crystalline spherical particles. Applying such techniques can complement existing approaches, providing additional insights into aortic valve calcification, and perhaps also pathways for clinical treatments. For example, although our understanding of spherical particles in the vascular system is limited, their highly crystalline nature suggests that they would be quite difficult to dissolve. A consequence of this might be that research efforts that aim to prevent calcification or limit its progression, rather than trying to remove them, may be more clinically effective. Such new ways of looking at long-standing research problems may foster advances in cardiovascular and biomedical research.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta due to a needle-like osteophyte on the first lumbar vertebra [^1149ycja]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old woman was admitted with acute abdominal pain radiating to the back. Computed tomography examinations showed a needle-thin perforation of the aorta, opposite the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, with a pseudoaneurysm. A needle-sharp spinal osteophyte was located exactly opposite the perforation. There was no sign of infection, and the perforation seemed to have been caused by the osteophyte. This aortic perforation occurred without any major trauma, but repeated minor occupational trauma to her abdomen may have played an etiologic role. The pseudoaneurysm and adjacent aorta were exposed through a thoracolaparotomy. The aortic wall was normal, with good tensile strength; therefore, the perforation in the aortic wall was sutured with a double vascular suture, and the osteophyte was resected. To our knowledge, aortic perforation due to a vertebral osteophyte in the absence of major trauma has not previously been described.

### Atlas for the CT syndesmophyte score (CTSS) in patients with axial spondyloarthritis [^116sFJQi]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The syndesmophyte consists of a bony spur, in principle, originating from the vertebral corner (figures 4–11).
Syndesmophytes are classically vertically directed bony outgrowth lesions. These lesions contrast with horizontally directed extensions from the endplates, osteophytes/spondylophytes, which are seen in spondylosis and degenerative disc disease (DDD). A growth angle of ≥ 45° measured from the endplate is currently regarded as a surrogate to distinguish syndesmophytes from osteophytes. An easy approach is drawing a straight line parallel to and extending from the vertebral endplate; the syndesmophyte typically crosses this line upright to the opposite vertebra (figure 12). In the cervical spine, due to the concave or convex anatomy of the vertebral endplate (images 1a to 1c of figure 2), some adaptations of this method are necessary. First, the reader should compare one quadrant to the others within the same VU (eg, Q1 VU2 vs Q2 VU2, Q3 VU2 and Q4 VU2), followed by the comparison to a corresponding quadrant from another VU (eg, Q1 VU2 vs Q1 VU3), while considering the typical shape of the (cervical) vertebra and the natural variation among individual patients.
To be considered of grade 1 or higher, the syndesmophyte should cross the drawn straight line extending from the vertebral endplate (figure 4; third image can be scored as grade 1).
The IDS can be preserved in axSpA. However, IDS changes, such as IDS height loss or fissures, can also be observed as occurring in DDD, particularly with ageing. In the presence of such IDS alterations, the reader needs to be cautious with assessing syndesmophytes. In fact, exuberant bone formation due to degenerative changes might mimic syndesmophyte growth (figure 13). Also, in DDD, osteophytes can be difficult to differentiate from axSpA new bone formation, even if applying the ≥ 45° angle method explained in point 2 (figure 13). VUs with degenerative spondylophytes should be assigned a zero in the syndesmophyte grading. Occasionally, readers may find lesions compatible with syndesmophytes due to axSpA in vertebrae with reduced IDS height. In those circumstances, grades 1–3 should be attributed to syndesmophytes using the height of the IDS as it stands. Clinical information (eg, age, disease duration), if available, can assist in interpreting images avoiding misclassification of degeneration as axSpA.
Differentiation between primary ossified ligaments and bony outgrowths of the vertebral endplate might be challenging. However, the anatomy references, namely the site of attachment of the ligaments, can be of help (figure 14). Lesions clearly corresponding to ossified ligaments (eg, without a clear spur coming from the vertebral corner) must be excluded from the scoring according to the CTSS.
Readers should be aware of differential lesions since these lesions cannot be scored as part of the CTSS, a method specifically developed for axSpA-related syndesmophytes. Some examples include osteophytes, parasyndesmophytes or non-marginal syndesmophytes (originating from the lateral part of the vertebra), spondylosis or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (figures 12 and 13). Providing extensive information about these differential lesions is beyond the scope of this atlas. Main differences described for other imaging modalities, for example, conventional radiographs, also apply here and were previously reported.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^111uuqdH]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Intervertebral disc — degenerative disc disease pathophysiology and discogenic pain mechanisms — emphasizes disc composition, microenvironment, and clinical features. The disc is composed of the nucleus pulposus, the annulus fibrosus, and the fibrous attachments to the vertebral endplates, with anabolic growth factors such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), bone morphologic protein (BMP), growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5), and insulin-like growth factor (IL-GF) contrasted with catabolic enzymes and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs); the disc is relatively avascular with limited vascular support contributing to poor natural regenerative capacity when metabolic homeostasis is disrupted. Degenerative disc disease is defined as a diffuse, progressive, and age-related phenomenon characterized by nuclear dehydration and fibrosis with resultant disc space narrowing of approximately 3–4% height loss per year; hallmarks include increased MMP activation, decreased intervertebral disc cell viability, and decreased proteoglycan production, with fissures that may be radial or circumferential, loss of shock-absorbing function, bulging, and osteophyte development, and it may or may not result in discogenic low back pain. Annular fissures can provide a conduit for inflammatory mediators to trigger nociceptive nerve endings in the outer annulus fibrosus, with nerve ingrowth along fissures and discogenic pain developing with internal disc disruption; internal disc disruption has been shown to be present in approximately 36% to 39% of the patients.

### Spinal stenosis… [^113MRvw3]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Spinal stenosis is a term used to describe a narrowing of the spinal canal, which contains the spinal cord and emerging nerve roots. It can occur in any portion of the spine. Because of limited space, changes in the bone or soft tissues can result in compression of the affected spinal cord and blood vessels. This narrowing can be congenital or acquired or a combination of both. Stenosis can be classified by location: central or lateral. Cord compression can also occur in patients with advanced cancer. The February 27, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about treatment options for cord compression due to metastatic cancer.

Conditions that result in spinal stenosis Osteophytes — formation of bony spurs associated with osteoarthritis Herniated disk — protrusion of a cartilage disk between vertebrae Malignancy — cancer Scarring and inflammation of supporting spinal ligaments Abscess — localized infection Spondylolisthesis — a shift or abnormal stacking of 2 vertebral bodies. Congenital — genetic predisposition, which results in a developmentally small spinal canal Systemic bone diseases Symptoms of spinal stenosis Pseudoclaudication — difficulty in walking Paresthesia — abnormal skin sensations such as numbness and tingling. This means that the tube of the spinal canal must be made larger by removing excess bone, ligaments, and abnormal tissues that are compressing the nerve roots. This type of surgical procedure is termed a decompressive laminectomy.

If individuals have both spinal stenosis and instability of the spine, the surgical procedure should include a decompression coupled with a spinal fusion. To purchase bulk reprints, call 203/259–8724. TOPIC: BACK PROBLEMS Zeller JL, Lynm C, Glass RM. Spinal Stenosis. JAMA. 2008; 299:

### What is osteoarthritis? | Geriatrics-JAMA network… [^116U1Gpw]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although OA has commonly been attributed to the "wear and tear" of aging, it is now understood as a complex disease involving breakdown of cartilage between bones, bone remodeling, and joint inflammation. Although OA can involve any joint in the body, the joints most frequently affected are the hips, knees, feet, and hands. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis and affects an estimated 32 million people in the US and more than 240 million people worldwide. The risk of OA increases markedly with increasing age and is exceedingly rare in individuals younger than 30 years. Female sex, obesity, previous joint injury, joint anatomic abnormalities, and having family members affected by OA also increase the risk of developing OA.

Typical symptoms of OA include joint pain that increases with movement and is relieved by rest, and brief joint stiffness that develops after inactivity. On physical examination, individuals with OA may have joints that appear "knobby" due to remodeling of bone and cartilage. X-ray imaging of joints with OA may show joint space narrowing and bone spurs. Blood work and other imaging studies are not needed to diagnose OA. Common first medications used to treat joint pain due to OA are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can be applied directly to the skin or taken orally. Acetaminophen may be used in individuals without liver disease or heavy alcohol use as an alternative to NSAIDs, which may cause bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or adversely affect kidney function.

Narcotic pain medications other than tramadol are not as effective in treating joint pain and pose additional risks, so narcotics are not recommended for treatment of OA. Injection of a steroid into a joint affected by OA may help decrease pain and swelling, although these benefits typically decrease within 3 months. Injection of hyaluronic acid into the joint space is sometimes used for treatment of OA, although evidence for its effectiveness is weak. Patients with hip or knee OA who have persistent pain and loss of function despite the above treatments may benefit from joint replacement surgery. Approximately 90% of individuals who undergo total hip replacement and 80% who undergo a total knee replacement have little to no residual pain after recovering from these operations.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of spinal stenosis… [^111VVzaB]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Spinal stenosis is a narrowing or stricture of the lower part of the spinal canal that results in neurogenic claudication. Symptoms begin with progressive degenerative changes and compression, although the severity is not necessarily associated with the degree of compression seen on imaging studies. The etiology can be congenital or acquired. Congenital stenosis typically causes symptoms earlier in life. Biomechanical and biochemical changes lead to decreased disc height with annular bulging, disc herniation and early osteophyte formation. The foraminal space narrows, resulting in nerve entrapment. A gradual shift in spinal alignment exacerbates the stenosis, exerting additional pressure on the neural elements. Decreased rotational accommodation coupled with altered motion cause inflammation of the cauda equina and, ultimately, pain. Compression combined with inflammation and irritation of the nerve root causes symptoms in the lower extremities.

Decreased blood flow can be another factor related to symptoms. Patients may report that the pain or numbness starts distally and progresses proximally. Symptoms can be asymmetric or vary from side to side. A sudden onset of pain in the lower extremities or a worsening of pre-existing pain may signal concomitant disc herniation or a more acute decrease in vascular supply. Pain is usually exacerbated with spinal extension and decreased with flexion. Urinary dysfunction is uncommon, but many patients report a feeling of urgency. Results of general physical and neurologic examinations are frequently normal, although asymmetric knee or ankle reflexes are possible, as well as muscle weakness in the lower extremities. However, a specific motor deficit is uncommon. Results of a straight-leg raising test are characteristically negative.

Anteroposterior and lateral flexion-extension radiographs provide additional information in evaluations for degenerative spondylolisthesis or other evidence of movement dysfunction. The authors conclude that patients require careful screening for surgery because postoperative patient dissatisfaction is associated with poor preoperative functional status, the presence of multiple comorbidities and the predominance of back pain. editor's note: Decisions about surgery are generally based on the presence of persistent pain or the development of neurologic impairment. The shift from nonsurgical treatment to surgery requires consideration of the patient's perceptions and understanding of the problem. The best likelihood of achieving an acceptable result occurs when the physician and the patient share in the decision-making process. — r. s.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability… [^117D5xuX]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Primary exposure was lumbar spine radiographic changes, defined using the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Secondary exposures were defined using presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing. The composite score combined the number of lumbar spine segments with definite changes detected on radiographic images. Currently, the presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing are the most frequent changes detected on radiographs that may be indicative of spinal pathologic conditions, and the Kellgren-Lawrence grade is the tool commonly used to assess the severity of osteoarthritis.

The aim of this study was to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between lumbar radiographic changes and the severity of back pain–related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women using composite scores that combined the number of segments and type of changes in terms of K-L grade, disc space narrowing, and osteophytes. We hypothesized that a higher number of segments with lumbar radiographic changes would be associated with more severe back pain–related disability.

The Kellgren-Lawrence grade was summarized as grade 0 indicating normal; grade 1 indicating doubtful narrowing of disc space and possible osteophytic lipping; grade 2 indicating definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space; grade 3 indicating moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of disc space, some sclerosis, and possible deformity of bone contour; and grade 4 indicating large osteophytes, marked narrowing of disc space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour. segment, a binary exposure variable of 1 vs 0 was used. One possible explanation is the biomechanical stability provided by spinal osteophytes, which have been proven to increase spinal resistance in compression.

30 Another explanation is that the results simply reflect large numbers of analyses completed, which need future studies to verify.
