## Question

Contraindications to PEG placement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about contraindications to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the procedural fundamentals that define what makes PEG feasible or unsafe. Then, I should identify absolute contraindications grounded in guidelines and procedural series. Next, I will map relative contraindications that require risk–benefit analysis and mitigation. After that, I should separate technique-specific issues where the "pull" approach is contraindicated but other methods may be viable. Finally, I need to integrate outcomes and risk predictors that influence appropriateness and timing, along with alternatives when PEG is not feasible.

> Let me first confirm the framework. PEG requires safe endoscopic transillumination, finger indentation, and the ability to appose the gastric and abdominal walls with a patent path for tube passage; if these steps cannot be achieved, the risk of visceral injury, peritonitis, and technical failure increases substantially. I need to ensure I'm consistent with guideline terminology by classifying contraindications as absolute, relative, and technique-specific or procedural, because the latter often signal the need to choose an alternative approach rather than forgo gastrostomy entirely [^115Gpyc7] [^111rkg3a] [^112TuW6d].

> Now, the absolute contraindications. I should double-check the canonical list. Uncorrectable coagulopathy is repeatedly cited as absolute because hemorrhage risk cannot be adequately mitigated if correction is impossible; active peritonitis is also absolute given the risk of exacerbating intra-abdominal infection; and inability to bring the anterior gastric wall into apposition with the abdominal wall is a technical absolute that precludes safe tract creation. Additionally, pharyngeal or esophageal obstruction that prevents passage of the endoscope or the tube can be absolute for the standard "pull" method; hold on, I need to be careful here, because in some cases this proves to be technique-specific rather than a universal absolute to enteral access. Finally, limited life expectancy with futility of benefit is described as an absolute ethical contraindication in some procedural texts, underscoring that PEG should not be used to prolong dying without quality-of-life gain [^112YWVCk].

> Wait, let me verify the issue of ascites and cirrhosis, because this is often nuanced. The ESGE guideline lists ascites as an additional infection risk rather than an absolute prohibition, but several large datasets and series show markedly higher complications and mortality when ascites is present, including increased peritonitis and in-hospital mortality, and very high early mortality among cirrhotics with ascites. Given this signal, severe or uncontrolled ascites functions as a practical or "functional absolute" in many settings, and I should consider alternatives or preprocedural optimization such as paracentesis, or a different access route like PTEG when PEG is not feasible or is excessively risky [^115Gpyc7] [^1174BMVK] [^114Y1kki] [^117GZmkk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about obstruction of the proximal GI tract. Initially I stated "obstructing pharyngeal/esophageal disease is an absolute contraindication", but I should correct that: severe esophageal stenosis or head and neck cancer often contraindicate the "pull" technique due to tumor seeding or technical passage risk, yet PEG may still be feasible using a direct percutaneous introducer "push" technique or radiologic/laparoscopic alternatives. So this is better framed as a technique-specific contraindication to "pull", not a universal absolute to gastrostomy access, provided an appropriate alternative route is selected [^112iLp31].

> Next, I should review relative contraindications that warrant risk–benefit assessment and mitigation. Hemodynamic or respiratory instability is relative because sedation and insufflation can precipitate decompensation; recent peptic ulcer bleeding with high rebleeding risk similarly warrants deferral or optimization; ventriculoperitoneal shunts carry added infection risk, and timing matters for infection rates; prior abdominal surgery is not prohibitive when safe transillumination and finger indentation are achieved; and obesity, once considered problematic, is generally feasible with experienced operators, whereas low BMI and frailty predict poorer outcomes and may warrant optimization before proceeding [^115Gpyc7] [^117YCZDm] [^111HBQs3] [^112RpeoB] [^112PWUbN].

> I need to ensure we address patient selection and futility explicitly. Higher age, lower BMI, and diabetes mellitus predict early mortality after PEG, and cohorts of very elderly inpatients and some dementia populations demonstrate short median survival, with multiple studies questioning benefit in advanced dementia. While "limited life expectancy" is framed as an absolute ethical contraindication in some procedural texts, in practice this demands a goals-of-care conversation, a trial of nasogastric feeding in the short term, and multidisciplinary consensus when anticipated benefit is marginal or absent, because PEG does not improve the underlying disease trajectory in advanced dementia and may not improve survival or quality of life in that subgroup [^112YWVCk] [^112PWUbN] [^113csDfy] [^1132vLKc] [^116Gmgob] [^116DAcDG].

> I will now examine technique-specific contraindications and solutions. Severe esophageal stenosis and head and neck or esophageal cancers are relative or procedural contraindications to the transoral "pull" technique; wait, I see I previously wrote "HNC contrain" — that was truncated; the intended correction is that HNC and esophageal malignancy often contraindicate "pull", with ESGE recommending the direct percutaneous introducer "push" method as the preferred alternative in these settings to reduce tumor seeding and traversal risks. Moreover, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to mitigate peristomal infection risk irrespective of the technique selected [^112iLp31].

> Let me consider technical barriers to transillumination and abdominal wall apposition and how to mitigate them. When standard transillumination or finger indentation is inadequate, alternatives include EUS-guided PEG in select anatomies, mini-laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted PEG to visualize and position the stomach safely, or radiologically inserted gastrostomy when endoscopic access is not possible; these approaches convert a potential absolute technical failure into a feasible procedure, provided patient factors are otherwise acceptable [^114BrcPN] [^111Go8eD] [^113F9ayi] [^111rkg3a].

> I should confirm antithrombotic considerations versus true coagulopathy. Uncorrectable coagulopathy remains an absolute contraindication because bleeding cannot be controlled. However, contemporary guidance suggests PEG can often proceed without withholding antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulation decisions should be individualized; observational data show low rates of severe bleeding and only modest increases in minor bleeding when anticoagulation is continued. This distinction matters: correctable coagulopathy should be optimized, but the mere presence of antiplatelet therapy alone is not an absolute bar to PEG [^112YWVCk] [^1155AF7w] [^113rtfUZ] [^111BZ5rA] [^111HtDNE].

> But wait, what about ventriculoperitoneal shunts and infection risk sequencing. I should double-check the timing data. Infection rates appear lowest when the shunt predates PEG, and higher when PEG is followed by VPS or when both are performed simultaneously, so VPS is not an absolute contraindication but does require careful timing and prophylaxis planning within a neurosurgical–GI–ID collaboration to reduce infection risk [^115Gpyc7] [^117YCZDm].

> Finally, to synthesize: absolute contraindications include uncorrectable coagulopathy, active peritonitis, and inability to achieve safe gastric–abdominal wall apposition; limited life expectancy with futility is a strong ethical absolute in many procedural frameworks, though it requires shared decision-making, and severe or uncontrolled ascites often functions as a practical absolute given markedly increased complications. Relative contraindications include hemodynamic or respiratory instability, recent high-risk GI bleeding, VPS presence, malnutrition and frailty, and certain anatomic challenges after prior surgery or with obesity that can be mitigated. Technique-specific contraindications to "pull" include severe esophageal stenosis and head and neck or esophageal cancers, where direct percutaneous "push", radiologic, EUS-guided, or laparoscopic-assisted alternatives should be considered to safely achieve durable enteral access [^112YWVCk] [^115Gpyc7] [^1174BMVK] [^114Y1kki] [^112iLp31] [^111HBQs3] [^112RpeoB] [^114BrcPN] [^112TuW6d] [^111rkg3a].

PEG placement has **absolute contraindications** including uncorrectable coagulopathy, active peritonitis [^112YWVCk], severe sepsis, hemodynamic instability, and inability to appose the stomach to the abdominal wall [^112YWVCk] [^114BrcPN]. Relative contraindications include **ascites** [^115Gpyc7] [^1174BMVK], **peritoneal carcinomatosis** [^112TuW6d], **severe obesity** [^112RpeoB], **prior upper abdominal surgery** [^111HBQs3], and **severe respiratory compromise** [^115Gpyc7]. Advanced dementia [^1132vLKc] [^116Gmgob], terminal illness, and severe malnutrition [^112PWUbN] [^113csDfy] are not absolute contraindications but require careful consideration due to limited benefit and high risk. Alternatives such as radiologic gastrostomy [^1155ddu3] [^112iLp31], surgical gastrostomy [^111qgNfc], or nasojejunal feeding [^115Gpyc7] [^1146yLbo] should be considered when contraindications are present [^1155AF7w] [^113F9ayi].

---

## Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications are conditions in which PEG placement is **strictly prohibited** due to unacceptable risk:

- **Uncorrectable coagulopathy**: Platelet count < 50,000/µL, INR > 1.5, or aPTT > 50 seconds.

- **Active peritonitis or severe intra-abdominal infection**: Ongoing infection significantly increases morbidity and mortality [^112YWVCk].

- **Severe sepsis or hemodynamic instability**: Unstable patients are at high risk for procedural complications [^115Gpyc7] [^112iLp31].

- **Inability to appose the stomach to the abdominal wall**: Due to interposed organs [^114BrcPN], severe adhesions, or anatomical distortion [^112YWVCk].

---

## Relative contraindications

Relative contraindications are conditions in which PEG placement may be considered only after **careful risk-benefit analysis** and with appropriate precautions:

- **Ascites**: Particularly malignant or refractory ascites, increases risk of infection, leakage, and peritonitis [^1174BMVK] [^115Gpyc7].

- **Peritoneal carcinomatosis**: Associated with high complication rates and limited benefit.

- **Severe obesity**: Technical challenges due to impaired transillumination and difficulty approximating the stomach to the abdominal wall [^112RpeoB].

- **Prior upper abdominal surgery**: Adhesions and altered anatomy increase risk of complications.

- **Severe respiratory compromise**: Patients with significant respiratory insufficiency are at increased risk of peri-procedural complications [^115Gpyc7].

---

## Patient populations requiring special consideration

Certain patient populations require **careful evaluation** because of increased risk or limited benefit:

- **Advanced dementia**: PEG placement does not improve nutritional status or survival and is associated with worse outcomes [^1132vLKc].

- **Terminal illness or severe malnutrition**: High mortality and limited benefit; careful patient selection is essential [^112PWUbN] [^113csDfy].

- **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**: Timing of PEG placement is critical; early placement before significant respiratory compromise is recommended.

---

## Alternative feeding methods

When PEG placement is contraindicated, **alternative feeding methods** should be considered:

| **Alternative method** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) | - Severe obesity <br/> - Prior abdominal surgery <br/> - Anatomical distortion | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Effective | Higher tube-related complications [^1155ddu3] [^112WHEzo] |
| Surgical gastrostomy | - Severe adhesions <br/> - Anatomical distortion <br/> - Failed PEG | - Direct visualization <br/> - Effective | - More invasive <br/> - Higher complication rates [^111qgNfc] |
| Nasojejunal feeding | - Short-term feeding [^115w79xF] <br/> - High aspiration risk | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Temporary | - Discomfort <br/> - Frequent replacement [^115Gpyc7] [^1146yLbo] |

## Summary table of contraindications

| **Absolute contraindications** | **Relative contraindications** |
|-|-|
| Uncorrectable coagulopathy | Ascites |
| Active peritonitis | Peritoneal carcinomatosis |
| Severe sepsis or hemodynamic instability | Severe obesity |
| Inability to appose stomach to abdominal wall | Prior upper abdominal surgery |
| ∅ | Severe respiratory compromise |

---

PEG placement has clear absolute and relative contraindications; **careful patient selection and risk assessment** are essential [^1155AF7w]. When contraindications are present, alternative feeding methods should be considered [^115Gpyc7].

### Interventional radiology techniques for provision of enteral feeding [^113F9ayi]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy placement in patients who are unable to maintain their nutrition orally has been achieved using a variety of techniques over the past century, including surgical, endoscopic, and more recently, percutaneous radiologically guided methods. Surgical gastrostomy placement was the method of choice for almost a century but has since been superseded by both endoscopic and radiological placement.

There are several indications for gastrostomy placement in clinical practice today, with fewer contraindications due to recent innovations in technique placement and gastrostomy catheter type. We describe the technique of gastrostomy placement used in our institution, along with appropriate indications and contraindications. Additionally, we will discuss the wide variety of catheter types available and their perceived advantages.

There remains some debate regarding gastropexy performance and the use of primary gastrojejunal catheters, which we will address. Furthermore, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three major types of gastrostomy placement currently available (i.e. surgical, endoscopic, and radiological) and their associated complications.

### PEG insertion in patients with dementia does not improve nutritional status and has worse outcomes as compared with PEG insertion for other indications [^1132vLKc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are commonly utilized as a method of enteral feeding in patients unable to obtain adequate oral nutrition. Although some studies have shown improved mortality in select populations, the safety and effectiveness of PEG insertion in patients with dementia, compared with those with other neurological diseases or head and neck malignancy, remains less well defined.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the nutritional effectiveness, rate of rehospitalization, and risk of mortality among patients with dementia compared with patients with other neurological diseases or head and neck cancers who undergo PEG placement.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis from a prospective database of patients who underwent PEG placement at an academic tertiary center between 2008 and 2013. The following data were collected: indication for PEG, patient demographics, biochemical markers of nutritional status, rehospitalization, and survival rates.

- **Results**: During the study period, 392 patients underwent PEG tube placement. Indications for PEG were dementia (N = 165, group A), cerebrovascular accident (N = 124, group B), and other indications such as oropharyngeal cancers and motor neuron disease (N = 103, group C). The mean follow-up time after PEG was 18 months (range, 3 to 36 mo). No differences in baseline demographics were noted. PEG insertion in the dementia (group A) neither reduced the rehospitalization rate 6 months post-procedure compared with groups B and C (2.45 vs. 1.86 and 1.65, respectively; P = 0.05), nor reduced the mortality rate.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement in the overweight and obese patient [^112RpeoB]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Traditionally, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement in obese patients has been considered a relative contraindication due to the impedance of gastric transillumination and the inability to approximate the abdominal and gastric wall. The aim of this study was to determine the overall success rate, morbidity, and PEG-related mortality in overweight and obese patients.

- **Methods**: Three hundred fifty-five consecutive patients were retrospectively evaluated over a 1-year period at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for postprocedure-related PEG and PEG/Jejunostomy (J) complications. One hundred thirty-four patients were considered overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 27 kg/m²). Of those, 80 patients were found to be obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) with a BMI ranging from 30–63 kg/m².

- **Results**: Gastrostomy placement was successful in 130 of 134 (97%) overweight patients (p < .05). The overall procedure-related mortality was 0%. The rate of significant complications in overweight and obese patients remained 0% when compared with patients with a normal BMI. Out of 355 patients, 14 failed to receive a PEG; 3 of these were obese and 1 was overweight. These 4 procedures were aborted due to a paucity of anatomical landmarks and failure to transilluminate the abdominal wall.

- **Conclusions**: We believe that PEG placement in overweight and obese patients can be a technically safe procedure according to our success rate of 100%, with a procedure-related mortality rate of 0%. In those overweight and obese patients who require specialized lon.

### Predictive factors of mortality after PEG insertion: Guidance for clinical practice [^112PWUbN]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is considered the preferred route for long-term enteral feeding. The aim of this study was to determine predictors of an increased mortality risk after PEG insertion.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted during a 13-year period in the gastroenterology department of Erlangen University Hospital. The authors completed a questionnaire with details of demographic data, diagnosis, indication for PEG, type of tube, and cause of death. Patients were contacted regularly at scheduled appointments.

- **Results**: In total, 787 patients (574 male [72.9%]) underwent PEG placement by the pull technique. The main underlying disease was malignant (75.6%). By the end of the study period, 614 patients had died. The average survival time was 720 days. The 30-, 60-, 90-day and 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality rates amounted to 6.5%, 9.8%, 13%, 32.1%, 59.3%, and 69.8%, respectively. Predictive factors of increased 30-day mortality were higher age, lower body mass index (BMI), and the presence of diabetes mellitus. The presence of all three variables served as an indicator to detect high-risk patients, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.64.

- **Conclusion**: Mortality predictors for patients after PEG insertion are higher age, lower BMI, and the presence of diabetes mellitus. To avoid unnecessary and dangerous examinations in high-risk patients, the above-mentioned predictive factors of mortality should be checked before PEG placement.

### Endoscopic management of enteral tubes in adult patients - Part 1: Definitions and indications. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^115Gpyc7]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The ESGE recommends considering the following indications for enteral tube insertion: (i) clinical conditions that make oral intake impossible, such as neurological conditions and obstructive causes; (ii) acute and/or chronic diseases that result in a catabolic state where oral intake becomes insufficient; and (iii) chronic small-bowel obstruction requiring a decompression gastrostomy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

The ESGE recommends the use of temporary feeding tubes placed through a natural orifice (either nostril) in patients expected to require enteral nutrition (EN) for less than 4 weeks. If it is anticipated that EN will be required for more than 4 weeks, percutaneous access should be considered, depending on the clinical setting. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

The ESGE recommends the gastric route as the primary option in patients in need of EN support. Only in patients with altered or unfavorable gastric anatomy (e.g. after previous surgery), impaired gastric emptying, intolerance to gastric feeding, or a high risk of aspiration, should the jejunal route be chosen. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.

The ESGE suggests that recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease with a risk of rebleeding should be considered a relative contraindication to percutaneous enteral access procedures, as should hemodynamic or respiratory instability. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

The ESGE suggests that the presence of ascites and ventriculoperitoneal shunts should be considered additional risk factors for infection.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: A safe and effective bridge for enteral nutrition in neurological or non-neurological conditions [^112YWVCk]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is one of the most commonly used methods for nutritional support in patients who are unable to take food orally. Alternatives include traditional surgical gastrostomy, percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy, and laparoscopic gastrostomy. The most common indication is neurogenic dysphagia, followed by obstructive causes such as head and neck tumors. Ethically justified and clinically comprehensive guidelines should be followed during the decision-making process for PEG tube placement.

Absolute contraindications include a limited life expectancy, technical difficulties such as the inability to bring the anterior gastric wall in apposition to the abdominal wall, or pharyngeal/esophageal obstruction that compromises tube insertion, peritonitis, and uncorrectable coagulopathy. The "pull method" was the first described and remains the most performed technique of PEG tube placement. The procedure is simple, safe, and effective, fulfilling all requirements to provide an ideal route for nutritional support. This article summarizes the reported experience on PEG in the literature and discusses its utility in patients with neurological conditions.

### Endoscopic management of enteral tubes in adult patients - part 2: Peri- and post-procedural management. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^112iLp31]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The ESGE recommends the "pull" technique as the standard method for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. This is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence. For cases where the "pull" method is contraindicated, such as in severe esophageal stenosis or in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) or esophageal cancer, the ESGE recommends the direct percutaneous introducer ("push") technique for PEG placement. Again, this is a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence.

For the prevention of post-procedural wound infection, the ESGE recommends the intravenous administration of a prophylactic single dose of a beta-lactam antibiotic, or an appropriate alternative in the case of allergies. This recommendation is strong and supported by moderate-quality evidence.

- **Inadvertent insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT)**: The ESGE considers it a serious but avoidable adverse event (AE). Each institution should have a dedicated protocol to confirm correct positioning of NGTs placed "blindly" at the patient's bedside. This protocol should include radiography, pH testing of the aspirate, and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, but not auscultation alone. This is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

- **Confirmation of correct NGT placement**: Radiography is recommended for high-risk patients, such as those in the intensive care unit (ICU) or patients with altered consciousness or absent gag/cough reflex. This recommendation is also strong and supported by low-quality evidence.

The ESGE suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may be started within 3–4 hours after the uncomplicated placement of a PEG or PEG-J.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy after abdominal surgery [^111HBQs3]. Surgical endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been established as a minimally invasive and safe procedure to provide nutritional support in patients unable to swallow food properly. However, a relative contraindication for the procedure is the existence of previous abdominal surgery.

- **Method**: We described our experience in performing PEG on 37 patients who had undergone surgery for upper abdominal diseases 10 days to 25 years previously. This group of 37 patients, 22 of whom had been subjected to laparotomy in the previous 2 weeks, was compared with 291 patients who had an intact abdomen regarding failure of the procedure to be performed, major and minor complications, and mortality.

- **Results**: The two groups were found to be comparable: failure rates of 2.71% (1/37) and 1.72% (5/291), no major complications, no mortality, and minor complication rates of 2.77% (1/36) and 2.44% (7/286).

- **Conclusions**: The PEG procedure is associated with minimal risk even in patients previously subjected to upper abdominal surgery, as long as transillumination of the stomach and finger palpation are seen clearly during endoscopy.

### EUS-guided percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for enteral feeding tube placement [^114BrcPN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Patients without adequate abdominal-wall transillumination are at a high risk of developing complications after PEG.

- **Objective**: We evaluated the feasibility and utility of EUS to guide PEG in patients lacking abdominal-wall transillumination.

- **Design**: Single-center case series.

- **Setting**: Tertiary-referral center.

- **Patients**: Six patients who lacked adequate abdominal-wall transillumination and two patients with a large laparotomy scar were deemed to be at high risk of developing complications after PEG.

- **Interventions**: Patients underwent EUS-guided PEG and deployment of a standard enteral feeding tube.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Technical success and complication rates.

- **Results**: PEG was successful under EUS guidance in five of eight patients. Causes of failure included an inadequate EUS window because of a prior Billroth 1 gastrectomy in one and suspected bowel interposition in two patients. There were no complications.

- **Limitations**: A small number of patients, uncontrolled study, and short follow-up period.

- **Conclusions**: This technique may facilitate deployment of PEG in patients who lack adequate abdominal-wall transillumination.

### Physician opinions on decision making for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube placement [^114dNg8N]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopically placed gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are useful for long-term enteral nutrition; however, they are associated with a lack of benefit for patients with advanced dementia, at the end of life, and for some stroke patients with early regain of swallowing function. We surveyed physician opinions on decision making with the aim of identifying factors that can lead to inappropriate PEG placement, as a first step of a quality improvement initiative to prevent inappropriate PEG placements at our facility.

- **Methods**: A survey was distributed to 231 physicians, with questions about discussion topics, contraindications, responsibilities, and practices in decision making for PEG placement. Five-point Likert scales were used for most responses.

- **Results**: Of 62 respondents, the majority were general surgeons (51.6%) and neurologists (30.6%). Levels of agreement were very low that PEG placement is contraindicated in advanced dementia (> 56% disagreed) and at the end of life (55% disagreed) with scores of 2.4 and 2.5 (out of 5), respectively. Agreement level was low (score of 2.85) for delaying PEG for stroke patients by at least 2 weeks. Agreement was high for the discussion topics, for allowing 1–7 days for processing information, and for consulting the nutrition service. Over 98% of respondents chose the primary team and 58% chose both primary and endoscopy teams as being responsible for discussions with patients and care partners in the decision-making process.

- **Conclusions**: Greater awareness is needed of the lack of benefit of PEG feeding in advanced dementia and at the end of life.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^117NMaUu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate patients' survival and complications after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, assess the quality of information provided to decision-makers (relatives) before the procedure, and measure their overall acceptance of the intervention.

We interviewed the relatives of 35 patients who underwent PEG tube placement in our facility from January 2008 to December 2009, using a structured questionnaire.

- **Results**: Thirty-day survival rate was 83%. The cumulative median survival was 35 days (95% CI: 27.7–42.3) and was not related to the patient's underlying condition. No patient died due to a procedure-related complication. Apart from topical skin reactions (26%), major complications, such as pneumonia, diarrhea, vomiting, and tube misplacement, were uncommon (3–11%).

- **Information quality**: Although 83% of the decision-makers considered that they had made an informed decision after being provided comprehensive information about the procedure, 71% said they had not been adequately informed about alternative methods.

- **Acceptance**: One-third of the relatives considered that the intervention met their expectations, and 67% of them would recommend PEG to other patients suffering from dysphagia. However, only 26% of decision-makers would consent again to PEG tube placement for their patient, while 69% did not answer this question.

In conclusion, patients' outcomes after PEG tube placement are favorable. However, several decision-makers are not satisfied with the quality of information given before informed consent, while the acceptance of the intervention is not very high.

### Decreasing use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube feeding for veterans with dementia-racial differences remain [^111mULGM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is a widely used method for long-term enteral feeding of demented patients unable to take sufficient food by mouth. National time trends in PEG tube use over the last decade have not been previously reported. The objective of this study was to determine whether use of PEG tubes for patients with dementia has changed over time and by race.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: All Veterans Affairs hospitals.

- **Participants**: Using an administrative database of the Veterans Health Administration, all veterans with dementia and all veterans who received a PEG tube were identified between fiscal years 1990–2001.

- **Measurements**: Proportion of PEG tube placement for dementia patients over time and by race.

- **Results**: Four hundred thirteen thousand six hundred twenty-seven dementia patients aged 60 and older were identified, of whom 6,464 (1.6%) received a PEG tube. Use of PEG tubes for dementia patients increased during the first half of the decade but subsequently decreased almost to baseline after peaking in 1996 (1990: 1.2%, 1996: 1.8%, 2001: 1.3%). Time trends in the use of PEG tube feeding for dementia patients varied by race. Specifically, the relative risk for PEG tube placement in African-American dementia patients increased from 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.25–2.17, FY 1990) to 1.97 (95% CI = 1.62–2.4, FY 2001).

- **Conclusion**: Although the overall use of PEG tube feeding for dementia patients decreased over time, rates in use and changes in use over time varied significantly by race.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy versus nasogastric tube feeding for adults with swallowing disturbances [^1146yLbo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

A number of conditions compromise the passage of food along the digestive tract. Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique, although its prolonged use can lead to complications such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia. Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period. There is a high demand for PEG in patients with swallowing disorders, although there is no consistent evidence about its effectiveness and safety as compared to NGT.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PEG as compared to NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception to August 2009, as well as contacting main authors in the subject area. There was no language restriction in the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We planned to include randomised controlled trials comparing PEG versus NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances or dysphagia and indications for nutritional support, with any underlying diseases. The primary outcome was intervention failures (feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors performed selection, data extraction and evaluation of methodological quality of studies. For dichotomous and continuous variables, we used risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD), respectively, with the random-effects sta.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: Summary and recommendations [^1155AF7w]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

This clinical practice guideline from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) provides an evidence-based approach for strategies to manage endoscopically placed gastrostomy tubes. This document was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.

- **Utility of PEG versus IR-G**: The guideline addresses the utility of PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) versus interventional radiology-guided gastrostomy (IR-G). In patients needing enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG as the preferred technique for initial gastrostomy over IR-G.

- **Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications**: It covers the need for withholding antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications before PEG tube placement. The ASGE suggests that PEG can be performed without withholding antiplatelet medications. The periprocedural management of anticoagulants should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion regarding the risk of bleeding versus cardiovascular events.

- **Timing of tube feeding initiation**: The guideline discusses the appropriate timing to initiate tube feeding after PEG placement. It recommends that tube feeding can be safely started within 4 hours of gastrostomy.

- **Technique selection in malignant dysphagia**: For patients with malignant dysphagia, the ASGE outlines the selection of the appropriate technique of gastrostomy. Either transoral "pull" PEG or direct PEG can be performed for initial enteral access.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy complication rates and compliance with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines for the management of antithrombotic therapy [^113rtfUZ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has published recommendations regarding anticoagulant (AC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapy management during endoscopic procedures. To date, no study has assessed either compliance with ASGE recommendations during percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement or the procedure-associated complication rates in relation to these recommendations. This study aimed to compare the incidence and type of complications during PEG placement in patients receiving or not receiving AC and/or AP therapy and to determine compliance with ASGE's AC and AP management guidelines.

- **Methods**: Medical files of patients who underwent PEG placement from January 2004 to December 2008 were reviewed. Clinical and procedure-related data were recorded. Patients were separated into two groups: those under AP and/or AC therapy prior to PEG placement (n = 51) and a control group (n = 40) not receiving any AP and/or AC treatment at least six months prior to the procedure.

- **Results**: A total of 91 patients (51 cases) were included. The groups were comparable in demographics and clinical characteristics. No differences in the frequency and type of complications were found between the groups. ASGE's recommendations were not followed in any of these patients.

- **Conclusions**: The overall PEG placement complication rate was 13.7%. AP therapy may be safely discontinued closer to the time of endoscopic procedures than currently recommended by the ASGE guidelines.

### Systematic review of ventricular peritoneal shunt and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a safe combination [^117YCZDm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Various international and national gastrointestinal guidelines take different positions on whether ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion is a contraindication to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether VPS insertion is a contraindication to PEG.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched using variations of the terms "ventriculo-peritoneal shunt" and "percutaneous (endoscopic) gastrostomy". This search resulted in 70 studies, 9 of which were relevant. These were cross-referenced, and 1 additional study was found, resulting in 10 studies in this systematic review.

- **Results**: The 10 relevant studies in adult cohorts included 208 patients. All studies, except one, were retrospective and generally of poor quality. Among the studies with relevant data, there were 26 (12.5% of 208 cases) VPS infections and 4 (4.4% of 90 cases) VPSs that malfunctioned. In 137 patients, the VPS had been placed before the PEG tube, with a VPS infection rate of 4.4%. More VPS infections occurred among the 55 patients who first had a PEG and a subsequent VPS (21.8%) and in the 16 patients who had simultaneous PEG tube and VPS placement (50%). The heterogeneity of the studies in this analysis prohibited statistical comparisons of the timing of VPS and PEG tube placement.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review indicated that VPS placement in combination with PEG is associated with varying rates of complications, particularly depending on the sequence and timing of the procedures.

### Mortality after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in patients with cirrhosis: a case series [^114Y1kki]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement can improve the nutritional status and the ability of a patient with cirrhosis to recover from surgery, such as orthotopic liver transplantation, although cirrhosis has been considered a significant contraindication to PEG tube placement. Our aim in this study was to describe the mortality and complications in a series of cirrhotic patients who underwent PEG at our institution.

- **Design**: Retrospective, single-institution case series.

- **Patients**: This study involved 26 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who underwent PEG between 1995 and 2005.

- **Intervention**: PEG tube placement.

- **Main outcome measurements and results**: The 30-day mortality of the series of patients was 10 of 26 (38.5%), whereas the 90-day mortality was 11 of 26 (42.3%). Nine of the 10 patients who died in the first 30 days had ascites at the time of PEG tube placement. Two patients died as a direct consequence of complications from the PEG procedure, whereas the other deaths were related to progression of liver disease or factors not directly related to the PEG.

- **Limitations**: The patients in this case series had varying levels of illness and reasons for PEG tube placement, such that a generalization of outcomes may not be possible.

- **Conclusions**: The overall mortality of patients with cirrhosis who underwent PEG is high. Although there is an increased risk, PEG tube placement in cirrhotic patients without ascites may be less risky. The benefits of PEG tube placement in patients with cirrhosis should be weighed heavily against the risk.

### Anticoagulation management around percutaneous bedside procedures: Is adjustment required [^111BZ5rA]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) are frequently performed bedside in the intensive care unit. Critically ill patients often require anticoagulant (AC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapies for various indications. There are no societal guidelines offering strategies to manage AC/AP therapies periprocedurally for bedside PEG or PDT. The aim of this study is to evaluate the management of AC/AP therapies around PEG/PDT, assess periprocedural bleeding complications, and identify risk factors associated with bleeding.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, observational study of all adult patients admitted from October 2004 to December 2009 receiving a bedside PEG or PDT was conducted. Patients were identified by procedure codes via an in-hospital database. A medical record review was performed for each included patient.

- **Results**: Four hundred fifteen patients were included, with 187 PEGs and 352 PDTs performed. Prophylactic anticoagulation was held for approximately one dose before and two doses or less after the procedure. There was wide variation in patterns of holding therapy in patients receiving anticoagulation via continuous infusion. There were 19 recorded minor bleeding events, 1 (0.5%) with PEG and 18 (5.1%) with PDT, with no hemorrhagic events. No association was found between international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, or activated partial thromboplastin time values and bleed risk (p = 0.853, 0.689, and 0.440, respectively). Platelet count was significantly lower in patients with a bleeding event.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^112wiB1h]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our results show that patients' outcomes after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement are favorable. However, several deficiencies in the decision-making process have been identified and must be addressed properly. These deficiencies violate patients' and/or decision-makers' self-determination, negatively influence the doctor-patient partnership, and might lead to malpractice claims. Although some decision-makers believe that PEG feeding improved the patient's and family's quality of life, they are skeptical to re-consent for PEG, limiting the acceptance of the intervention at the same time.

### The 'cut and push' technique: Is it really safe [^1142C2oo]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding is routinely used as an effective method for providing enteral nutrition in individuals whose oral access has been diminished or lost. One technique for the removal of the PEG is cutting the tube at the skin level, allowing the tube and internal flange to pass spontaneously. This is known as the 'cut and push' method.

Several studies have concluded that the 'cut and push' method is safe and cost-effective. However, this case demonstrates a rare cause of small bowel obstruction following the 'cut and push' method for PEG replacement, with only a few other cases reported. This method of removal should be avoided in patients with previous abdominal surgeries. It is important that the PEG flange is retrieved endoscopically, or an alternative PEG tube designed to be completely removed through the skin should be used to prevent this complication in such individuals.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a case series with a multidisciplinary, team-based approach [^115zybdW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease leading to a decline of motor functions at the spinal and bulbar levels. In advanced stages, bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia and dysarthria result in malnutrition, weight loss, risk of aspiration, and increased morbidity and mortality. Other malnutrition risk factors in ALS patients include anxiety, cognitive impairment, difficulty with self-feeding or meal preparation, and respiratory insufficiency. Malnutrition in ALS is common, with a prevalence ranging between 16% and 55%. To maintain adequate oral intake and provide an alternative route for medications, gastrostomy placement is recommended.

There are several methods of gastrostomy insertion:

- **Surgical gastrostomy**: This includes open or laparoscopic techniques and is rarely used due to higher complication rates and greater mortality. It is typically reserved for patients undergoing abdominal surgery or when other approaches are not possible.
- **Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)**: Gastroenterologists insert PEG tubes with endoscopy using conscious sedation.
- **Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and per-oral image-guided gastrostomy (PIG)**: Interventional radiologists perform these procedures under fluoroscopic guidance.
	- **PRG**: Does not use conscious sedation but only allows small-bore tube placement.
	- **PIG**: Allows large-bore tube insertion, requires minimal sedation, and is a more complex procedure.

### Basic geriatric assessment does not predict in-hospital mortality after PEG placement [^112wekPC]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an established procedure for long-term nutrition. However, studies have underlined the importance of proper patient selection, as mortality has been shown to be relatively high in acute illness and certain patient groups, including geriatric patients. The objective of the study was to gather information about geriatric patients receiving PEG and to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality after PEG placement.

- **Methods**: All patients from the GEMIDAS database undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in acute geriatric wards from 2006 to 2010 were included in a retrospective database analysis. Data on age, gender, main diagnosis leading to hospital admission, death in hospital, care level, and legal incapacitation were extracted from the main database of the Geriatric Minimum Data Set. Self-care capacity was assessed by the Barthel index, and cognitive status was rated with the Mini Mental State Examination or subjectively judged by the clinician. Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were chosen according to the distribution and scale of measurement. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the influence of various factors on hospital mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 1232 patients (60.4% women) with a median age of 82 years (range 60 to 99 years) were included. The mean Barthel index at admission was 9.5 ± 14.0 points. Assessment of cognitive status was available in about half of the patients (n = 664), with 20% being mildly impaired and almost 70% being moderately to severely impaired.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy versus percutaneous radiological gastrostomy for swallowing disturbances [^111srUzB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy has been established as the standard procedure for administering long-term enteral nutrition in individuals with swallowing disturbances. Percutaneous gastrostomy is a less-invasive approach than open surgical gastrostomy and can be accomplished via endoscopy (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG) or sonographic or fluoroscopic guidance (percutaneous radiological gastrostomy or PRG). Both techniques have different limitations, advantages, and contraindications. In order to determine the optimal technique for long-term nutritional supplementation, many studies have been conducted to compare the outcomes of these two techniques; however, it remains unclear which method is superior with respect to both efficacy and safety.

- **Objectives**: To compare the safety and efficacy of PEG and PRG in the treatment of individuals with swallowing disturbances.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, January 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to 22 January 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 22 January 2016), the reference lists of identified articles, databases of ongoing trials, including the Chinese Cochrane Centre Controlled Trials Register, and PubMed. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PEG with PRG in individuals with swallowing disturbances, regardless of the underlying disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently evaluated the search results and assessed the quality of the studies. Data analyses could not be completed due to truncated data.

### Patient outcomes related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement [^11784yMY]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Although many aspects of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have been addressed in the literature, attention to psychological and social outcomes of PEG has been limited. Our goal was to assess a range of physical, psychological, and social outcomes related to PEG feeding. This study is a follow-up survey of patients undergoing PEG and/or their surrogates. Data were collected through semistructured interviews in two tertiary hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Measurements consisted of PEG status at 1-year follow-up, quality of life, impact on caregivers, and opinions about long-term support via PEG.

We included 71 patients in the study. Of all, 39% of patients died, 32% had the PEG still in place, and for 28% the PEG was removed at the end of the 1-year follow-up. The prognosis of the attending physician at the initial visit and the underlying disease were significantly related to the outcome (p < 0.05). After 1 year, 85% of all patients whose PEGs were still in place were not working, studying, or managing their own household in any capacity. Additionally, 67% were not managing personal care, and 19% were feeling very ill.

Fifty-two percent of the caregivers spent 15 hours or more per week visiting and caring for the patient. At the 1-year follow-up, all ten surviving patients who could be interviewed agreed they would have a PEG again. Seventy percent of the caregivers said that they would want the same decision to be made. Although a majority of patients and caregivers did not regret the decision to place a PEG, this did not necessarily mean enhanced quality of life.

### Trends and outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in hospitalized patients with malignant and nonmalignant ascites: a nationwide population study [^1174BMVK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with ascites resulting from chronic debilitating diseases often require non-oral enteral nutrition and undergo placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The aim of our study was to assess the nationwide trends and outcomes of PEG tube placement among patients with ascites.

- **Methods**: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients (≥ 18 years) who underwent PEG tube placement (n = 789,167) from 2010–2014. We divided these patients into two groups: with or without ascites. We compared demographics, complications, and in-hospital outcomes between the groups. STATA-13 was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assigned at P < 0.05.

- **Results**: Patients with ascites who underwent PEG tube placement were found to have a significantly higher rate of complications, including peritonitis (7.52% vs. 0.72%; P < 0.001), aspiration pneumonia (20.41% vs. 2.69%; P < 0.001), hemoperitoneum (0.72% vs. 0.19%; P < 0.001), procedure-related hemorrhage (1.69% vs. 0.9%; P < 0.001), and esophageal perforation (0.51% vs. 0.47%; P < 0.001). In addition, these patients also had higher in-hospital mortality (16.33% vs. 7.02%; P < 0.001) despite having a relatively lower prevalence of comorbidities. Length of stay was longer in the ascites group (28.08 vs. 19.45 days; P < 0.001). Over the study period, however, we observed an increasing trend for PEG tube placement in hospitalized patients with ascites.

- **Conclusion**: PEG tube placement in hospitalized patients with ascites is associated with significantly higher mortality rates and complications.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy; evidence of different prognosis in various patient subgroups [^113csDfy]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

As there are no prospective randomised trials about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion, the medical staff and caregivers encounter great difficulty in deciding when and if to perform this procedure.

- **Objective**: To explore which variables are associated with increased mortality after PEG insertion.

- **Design**: Prospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Gastroenterological unit of a 500-bed community hospital.

- **Subjects**: All patients over the age of 50 years referred for PEG insertion between January 1992 and December 2002.

- **Methods**: Patients were studied for their indication for PEG insertion as well as their main medical problems. Demographic details and medical records were reviewed yearly until mortality.

- **Results**: 674 patients were enrolled (mean age 80.1 years, 42% men). The median survival was worst in diabetic patients (128 days, P < 0.05), patients referred from hospital (161 days, P < 0.01), and patients over the age of 80 years with dementia (171 days, P < 0.001). The best median survival was found among demented patients under the age of 80 (467 days, P < 0.05) and women under the age of 80 referred from nursing homes (780 days, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: The outcome after PEG insertion is variable, with survival of over a year in many of the patients. These data are important for the medical staff, the patients, and their caregivers when deciding about PEG placement.

### Long-term outcomes of infants and children undergoing percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy tube placement [^112H5BDz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about long-term outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The purpose of this study was to examine tube-related major complications in pediatric patients undergoing PEG placement during a 10-year follow-up period.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing PEG placement from April 1999 through December 2000 at Boston Children's Hospital was performed. Cumulative incident rates of major complications (defined by additional hospitalization, surgical or interventional radiology procedures) as well as time between PEG placement and major complications were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Time to elective tube removal and patient mortality were also assessed.

- **Results**: One hundred thirty-eight patients (59% [n = 82] boys [median age 22.5 months] [interquartile range, IQR 9–72.5], weight 9.2 kg [IQR 6.1–15.8]) underwent PEG placement during the study period and were followed at our hospital for a median of 4.98 years (IQR 1.5–8.7). Median time to elective tube removal was 10.2 years, with approximately half of the patients estimated to still have an indwelling enteral tube 10 years after placement. Fifteen patients (11%) had at least one major complication related to their gastrostomy tubes during the examined time period. The cumulative incidence of patients having a major complication was 15% (95% confidence interval 8.9–24.5) by 5.4 years.

- **Conclusions**: Children undergoing PEG placement have a long-term high risk of morbidity related to enteral tubes.

### Laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: A simple and efficient technique for disabled elderly patients [^111Go8eD]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a simplified catheter placement procedure for alimentation. Although the endoscopic approach to gastrostomy tube placement is a safe and well-tolerated procedure in most patients, the PEG procedure is difficult in elderly patients who have been disabled since childhood and who have severe scoliosis and malpositioning of the stomach. We describe a simple and effective laparoscopic-assisted PEG (LAPEG) technique that can be used for catheter placement in severely disabled patients.

- **Methods**: Thirteen severely disabled patients aged 14–57 years underwent gastrostomy tube placement with the LAPEG technique. After general anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed into the stomach. Then, a 5-mm camera port was inserted at the umbilicus, and a 3-mm working port was inserted to identify and lift the optimal site for gastrostomy tube placement. After the 4-point fixation of the stomach, the 20-Fr gastrostomy tube was placed under endoscopic and laparoscopic observation.

- **Results**: All patients tolerated the procedure well, and there were no major complications. The procedure was successful, and all patients could feed via the tube.

- **Conclusions**: Elderly disabled patients who have been bedridden since childhood often have severe scoliosis and malpositioning of the stomach. Our LAPEG procedure is effective, well tolerated, and safe for gastrostomy tube placement in such elderly patients.

### Impact of antithrombotic medications on postprocedural outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: A US Collaborative Network study [^111HtDNE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an essential procedure for patients who require long-term enteral nutrition but are unable to eat orally. However, it carries a risk of bleeding, particularly in patients on anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This study aimed to assess the bleeding risk associated with continuing anticoagulation or DAPT during PEG placement using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network Database.

- **Methods**: We analyzed four cohorts: patients on anticoagulants, patients not on anticoagulants, patients on DAPT, and patients on aspirin (ASP). The focus was on gastrostomy-related bleeding within 7 and 30 days, along with secondary outcomes such as mortality and the need for blood transfusion or endoscopic reintervention.

- **Results**: Our analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the 7-day bleeding risk between the anticoagulant and no anticoagulant groups. However, a higher 30-day bleeding risk was observed in the anticoagulant group (0.9% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in the incidence of severe bleeding events requiring endoscopic intervention or blood transfusion. Furthermore, the difference in the bleeding risk between the DAPT and ASP groups was not statistically significant within 7 and 30 days.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that while anticoagulant use increases the risk of minor post-PEG bleeding, it does not lead to a higher incidence of severe bleeding. Additionally, the continuation of DAPT was not associated with a statistically significant increase in bleeding risk.

### Use of a large-diameter 30-French venting gastrostomy tube is effective and safe for symptom palliation in patients with malignant bowel obstruction [^115hTtJT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment options for malignant bowel obstruction are limited, particularly in poor surgical candidates. Standard percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes used for venting are of small caliber, limiting success. This study examines outcomes in patients who received larger-caliber 30-Fr PEGs for treatment of malignant bowel obstruction.

- **Method**: Retrospective chart review for all patients who received large-caliber venting PEGs for malignant bowel obstruction at a single institution.

- **Results**:
	- Thirty-six patients were included. The most common primary cancer diagnoses were ovarian (22%), mucinous appendiceal (19%), and colorectal (17%). Symptom relief was achieved in all patients (100%).
	- Four patients (11%) sought medical care for re-symptoms due to an incorrect venting technique. Large-caliber venting PEGs were placed on the first admission for obstruction in 17 patients (47%) and were used to replace standard caliber PEGs in 8 patients because of persistent symptoms (22%).
	- Significant ascites was observed in 12 patients (33%), but paracenteses were performed in only 3 of these patients prior to PEG placement. Most large-caliber venting PEGs were placed during hospital admission (34/36, 94%) and facilitated hospital discharge (33/34, 97%).
	- Two significant (6%) and two minor adverse events (6%) occurred.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of large-caliber venting PEGs for malignant bowel obstruction. This facilitated hospital discharge in almost all patients and prevented readmissions when a correct technique was applied.

### Severe recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement: a rare complication [^111N4Knp]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Severe bleeding requiring blood transfusions following endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement is a rare complication. We describe a case of severe rehaemorrhage with bright red blood from the rectum after endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement, which ultimately required the removal of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

### Comparative outcomes of endoscopic and radiological gastrostomy tube placement: A systematic review and meta-analysis with GRADE analysis [^112WHEzo]. Annals of gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Enteral access through a gastrostomy tube is often required in patients unable to maintain adequate volitional intake of food. The most common techniques for performing a gastrostomy include percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG). PEG is often performed by gastroenterologists and surgeons using an endoscope placed within the stomach. PRG, on the other hand, is typically performed by radiologists using fluoroscopy and administration of oral contrast. Both techniques are considered safe and effective. However, in general, gastrostomy tube placement is associated with a significant risk of adverse outcomes, including perforation, infections, peritonitis, and death.

There are conflicting data regarding the comparative safety of PEG and PRG. Most of the data are restricted to single-center retrospective analyses that were underpowered to conclusively determine the comparative outcomes and adverse events. Hence, the preferred technique for safely performing a gastrostomy remains undetermined.

A prior systematic review and meta-analysis by Strijbos et al. was limited to 16 studies reporting data on only 934 PEG and 1,093 PRG procedures. The authors noted no difference for 30-day mortality or infectious complications, whereas tube-related complications were higher in the PRG group. However, recent studies from large, nationally representative databases encompassing multiple hospitals nationwide have reported a statistically significantly greater risk of 30-day mortality for PRG compared to PEG.

### Prophylactic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in treatment of head and neck cancer: A comprehensive review and call for evidence-based medicine [^113A6UTi]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) are at increased risk of experiencing malnutrition, which is associated with poor outcomes. Advances in the treatment of HNCs have resulted in improved outcomes; however, these advances often bring severe toxic oral side effects, placing patients at an even greater risk of malnutrition. Prophylactic placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes before treatment may be beneficial in patients with HNC, particularly those undergoing more intense treatment regimens. Nonetheless, PEG tube placement is not without risks.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted.

- **Results**: Systematic evidence assessing both the benefits and harm associated with prophylactic PEG tube placement in patients undergoing treatment for HNC is weak, and the benefits and harm have not been firmly established.

- **Conclusions**: More research is necessary to inform physician behavior on whether prophylactic PEG tube placement is warranted in the treatment of HNC.

### Complication rate lower after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy than after surgical gastrostomy: A prospective, randomized trial [^111qgNfc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has increasingly replaced surgical gastrostomy (SG) as the primary procedure for the long-term nutrition of patients with swallowing disorders. This prospective, randomized study compares PEG with SG in terms of effectiveness and safety.

- **Methods**: This study enrolled 70 patients with swallowing disorders, mainly attributable to neurologic impairment. All the patients, eligible for both techniques, were randomized to PEG (pull method) or SG. The groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, and underlying diseases. Complications were reported 7 and 30 days after the operative procedure.

- **Results**: The procedures were successfully completed for all patients. The median operative time was 15 minutes for PEG and 35 minutes for SG (p < 0.001). The rate of complications was lower for PEG (42.9%) than for SG (74.3%; p < 0.01). The 30-day mortality rates were 5.7% for PEG and 14.3% for SG, indicating a nonsignificant difference.

- **Conclusion**: The findings show PEG to be an efficient method for gastrostomy tube placement with a lower complication rate than SG. In addition, PEG is faster to perform and requires fewer medical resources. The authors consider PEG to be the primary procedure for gastrostomy tube placement.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in the open abdomen patient [^116TEmGi]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Nutrition support of critically ill patients is an integral element of their multimodal care. We describe the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term enteral access in a patient with an open abdomen. To our knowledge, this is the third successfully reported case that demonstrates the viability of PEG in this uncommon population. In critically ill and malnourished surgical patients with contraindications for immediate abdominal closure, PEG should be strongly considered as a procedure for enteral feedings.

### Prediction of risk of adverse events related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a retrospective study [^112cWjmR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Peg is the standard method of establishing prolonged enteral feeding for patients unable to sustain oral intake. Despite its feasibility, simple techniques for placement, and the added benefit of improved nutrition, it has been associated with a risk of adverse events. The number of admissions due to PEG-related adverse events in our center was 125 of a total of 3,227 admissions (3.87%) per year in the general internal medicine, gastroenterology, and geriatric departments. This apparently high percentage can be explained by the fact that our center is the major tertiary center in the city, while many of these patients underwent PEG insertion at other centers and came to us as referrals from other secondary and primary centers.

The incidence of adverse events reviewed in the literature differs significantly. Blomberg et al. found a one-month postoperative incidence of adverse events of 39%, dropping to 28% a month later. Gang and Kim reported a higher incidence of short-term adverse events in pediatrics, reaching 84.6%. Ermis et al. followed up with patients for a year after PEG insertion and demonstrated an 18% rate of adverse events. Lockett, in an earlier study, showed a comparable 16% rate of adverse events. Other studies have recorded complication rates ranging between 19–31%. This variation in the reported adverse events can be explained by the small sample sizes and the short follow-up durations in these studies. On the other hand, the mortality rate in these studies ranged between 33% and 3.3%.

We conducted the present study after analyzing data presented in e.

### Use of a large-diameter 30-French venting gastrostomy tube is effective and safe for symptom palliation in patients with malignant bowel obstruction [^1126wDgk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment options for malignant bowel obstruction are limited, particularly in poor surgical candidates. Standard percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes used for venting are of small caliber, limiting success. This study examines outcomes in patients who received larger-caliber 30-Fr PEGs for the treatment of malignant bowel obstruction.

- **Method**: Retrospective chart review for all patients who received a large-caliber venting PEG for malignant bowel obstruction in a series of patients at a single institution.

- **Results**: Thirty-six patients were included. The most common primary cancer diagnoses were ovarian (22%), mucinous appendiceal (19%), and colorectal (17%). Symptom relief was achieved in all patients (100%). Four patients (11%) sought medical care due to incorrect venting techniques. Large-caliber venting PEGs were placed on the first admission for obstruction in 17 patients (47%), and were used to replace standard caliber PEGs in 8 patients because of persistent symptoms (22%). Significant ascites was observed in 12 patients (33%), but paracenteses were performed in only 3 of these patients prior to PEG placement. Most large-caliber venting PEGs were placed during hospital admission (34/36, 94%), and facilitated hospital discharge in 33 out of 34 cases (97%). Two significant (6%) and two minor adverse events (6%) occurred.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of large-caliber venting PEGs for malignant bowel obstruction. This facilitated hospital discharge in almost all patients and prevented readmissions when a correct venting technique was used.

### Radiologic percutaneous gastrostomy in nondistended stomach: A modified approach [^112YifRn]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy tube placement for patients requiring long-term nutritional support may be performed using different techniques, including endoscopic, surgical, and percutaneous radiologically guided methods. Radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG), typically performed when percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is not possible, requires proper gastric distension achieved by insufflating air through a nasogastric tube. We describe a simple technique to prevent air escape from the stomach during gastrostomy tube placement. To the best of our knowledge, this technique has not yet been described in the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: Four patients with unsuccessful percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were referred for fluoroscopic-guided gastrostomy. One patient had a pyriform sinus tumor, and three had an ischemic stroke causing dysphagia. Gastric distention was not achieved in the patients due to air escaping into the bowel during the standard RIG procedure. A modified approach using a balloon catheter inflated in the pylorus to avoid air passing into the duodenum permitted successful RIG.

- **Results**: The modified RIG procedure was successfully carried out in all cases without complications.

- **Discussion**: Inadequate air distension of the stomach is an unusual event that causes a failure of gastrostomy tube placement and an increased risk of both major and minor complications. The use of a balloon catheter inflated in the first part of the duodenum prevents the air passage into the bowel, allowing the correct positioning of the gastrostomy tube.

### Prediction of risk of adverse events related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: A retrospective study [^11411yfm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is among the many different approaches used to establish enteral feeding for patients who cannot tolerate oral intake for prolonged periods. First introduced in 1980 by Ponsky and Gauderer, the procedure has gradually gained preference over the already established surgical and subsequently developed radiological techniques, as several studies have shown its superiority in terms of fewer adverse events as well as reduced mortality rates.

Despite its feasibility and minimally invasive techniques, this approach is not without the risk of adverse events. Several adverse events, either procedure-related or post-procedural, may develop. Post-procedural adverse events can be broadly divided into major and minor:

- **Major adverse events**: These are systemic, life-threatening, and can include aspiration pneumonia, massive PEG-related gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, colocutaneous fistula, abdominal wall abscess, and buried bumper syndrome.
- **Minor adverse events**: These include PEG-site infection, peristomal leakage, inadvertent PEG removal, minor GI-related bleeding, blocked PEG tube, and ileus.

The incidence of adverse events reviewed in the literature varies considerably. Some studies have attempted to identify markers that would predict the risk of adverse events and early mortality in patients undergoing PEG placement. These were aimed at risk stratifying patients to facilitate proper patient selection and timing for the procedure. Most studies concerning risk prediction for PEG-related adverse events were a reflection of the center's own data and experiences.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^116DAcDG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is widely used to provide feeding for patients suffering from dysphagia due to various causes of oral intake inability or for those who need supplemental feeding. However, not all patients benefit from the intervention, and efforts are focused on improving patients' quality of life rather than just prolonging it. Therefore, patient selection is of paramount importance in order to avoid providing PEG in futile cases. It has been proposed to avoid PEG in demented patients since it does not provide meaningful life prolongation, and to offer a 30–60 day "cooling" period with nasogastric tube feeding before PEG tube insertion in hospitalized patients in order to prevent early death and achieve long-term nutrition. Moreover, although PEG is relatively safe, it can be associated with significant early and late complications, which can be minimized with thorough knowledge of the procedure's indications and contraindications, its steps, and early recognition of complications.

Beyond the above clinical and ethical dilemmas, literature has revealed flaws regarding the informed consent procedure before PEG. These include not respecting the feelings and attitudes of family members toward gastrostomy feeding and providing insufficient information on alternative feeding options and on the complications of PEG. Moreover, at the time of writing, evaluation of long-term nutritional support given by PEG from the perspectives of the relatives who take care of the patient has received little attention.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^113ScsSE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate patients' survival and complications after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, the quality of information given to the decision-makers (relatives) before the procedure, and their overall acceptance of the intervention.

- **Methods**: We interviewed the relatives of 35 patients who underwent PEG tube placement in our facility from January 2008 to December 2009, using a structured questionnaire.

- **Results**: The thirty-day survival rate was 83%. The cumulative median survival was 35 days (95% CI: 27.7–42.3) and it was not related to the patient's underlying condition. No patient died due to procedure-related complications. Apart from topical skin reactions (26%), major complications, such as pneumonia, diarrhea, vomiting, and tube misplacement, were not common (3–11%). Although 83% of the decision-makers considered that they had provided an informed decision after being given comprehensive information about the procedure, 71% said that they had not been adequately informed about alternative methods. One-third of the relatives considered that the intervention met their expectations and 67% of them would recommend PEG to other patients suffering from dysphagia. However, only 26% of decision-makers would consent again for PEG tube placement for their patient, while 69% did not answer this question.

- **Conclusion**: Patients' outcomes after PEG tube placement are favorable. However, several decision-makers are not satisfied with the quality of information given before informed consent, while the acceptance of the intervention is not very high.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a case series with a multidisciplinary, team-based approach [^113Nkyg6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. When bulbar symptoms impair oral nutritional uptake, guidelines recommend percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Studies evaluating the appropriate timing and procedural method of placement of gastrostomy tubes have been published; however, no study has been published that evaluated outcomes from a team-based approach to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate 26 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with various respiratory statuses who had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes placed using a multidisciplinary approach that included neurology, anesthesia, general surgery, and gastroenterology. Preprocedural risks and postprocedural outcomes were compared with previously published studies.

- **Results**: The mean age at percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement was 66 years. The mean forced vital capacity was 54%, and 18 patients (72%) were on noninvasive ventilation. There were 3 minor complications and no major complications prior to index discharge. The mean length of hospital stay was 3 days. There were no delayed complications or deaths. All patients alive at 6 months and 1 year were using their gastrostomy tubes without problems.

- **Conclusions**: Compared to previously published studies, a multidisciplinary approach to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement had a better placement rate, fewer minor and major complications, and a comparative length of stay. These data

### Endoscopic rescue of early percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy tube dislodgement [^1116DRFv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is one of the most common methods for establishing durable enteral access. Early PEG dislodgement occurs in less than 5% of cases but typically prompts urgent surgical intervention to reestablish the gastrocutaneous tract and prevent intra-abdominal sepsis. At the time of writing, there is a single case report in the literature where successful endoscopic "rescue" of an early dislodged PEG tube negated the need for operative intervention. Here, we report our experience with a series of endoscopic PEG rescues for early dislodged PEG tubes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis of cases was reviewed from two institutions. Patients with early PEG dislodgements underwent PEG rescue using a gastroscope and standard Ponsky "pull" PEG techniques through the original tract.

- **Results**: Eleven patients were identified from the database and underwent PEG rescue after early PEG dislodgement. Mean operative time was 68 minutes, and there were no complications related to PEG rescue. PEG rescue permitted safe re-establishment of the gastrostomy tract while avoiding laparoscopic or open surgical intervention in hemodynamically stable patients. All patients tolerated the procedure well and were able to resume use of the PEG tubes shortly after intervention.

- **Conclusion**: Endoscopic rescue represents a feasible noninvasive option for PEG tube replacement following early inadvertent PEG tube dislodgement in appropriate clinical settings.

### Mini-laparoscopically guided percutaneous gastrostomy and jejunostomy [^112TuW6d]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic tube placement can be problematic under certain circumstances: absence of transillumination of the abdominal wall, percutaneous jejunostomy in patients with a PEG tube, enteral feeding access after gastrectomy, and obstruction of the upper GI tract. As an alternative in these problematic situations, a technique was developed for placing feeding tubes under visual control using mini-laparoscopy.

- **Methods**: Placement of a feeding tube with mini-laparoscopy with the patient under conscious sedation was considered for 17 patients in whom standard PEG placement was impossible. Techniques used were the following: combined mini-laparoscopy/endoscopy for placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy, and mini-laparoscopic-guided direct tube placement in cases of obstruction of the upper GI tract.

- **Observations**: In 13 patients, mini-laparoscopic-assisted tube placement was successful. In 4 patients, adhesions or peritoneal carcinomatosis prevented laparoscopic visualization of the stomach or small bowel. The combined mini-laparoscopic/endoscopic approach allowed a successful insertion of gastric tubes in 6 patients and jejunal tubes in 4 patients. Direct insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tube without enteroscopy was feasible in all 3 patients with obstruction of the upper GI tract. No complications occurred.

- **Conclusions**: Mini-laparoscopy-assisted tube placement is a simple and safe alternative when endoscopic percutaneous tube placement is problematic or not feasible.

### To pull or to scope: A prospective safety and cost-effectiveness of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement methods [^1115g3hL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are routinely used as an effective method for providing enteral nutrition, and the need for their exchange is common. We aimed to examine the comparative safety and cost-effectiveness of PEG tube replacement methods, specifically the percutaneous counter-traction "pulling" approach versus an endoscopically guided retrieval.

A prospective study included 215 consecutive patients undergoing PEG tube insertion, with 50 patients excluded. These patients were examined for demographics, indications for PEG replacement, procedure-related complications, and procedural costs.

- **Study results**:
	- Group A included 70 patients (42%) with PEG tubes replaced endoscopically, whereas Group B included 95 patients (58%) with PEG tubes replaced percutaneously. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (P = NS).
	- **Both groups had similar immediate complication rates**: 4 patients in Group B (4.2%) and 2 patients in Group A (2.8%) (P = 0.24). Complications included a conservatively managed esophageal perforation and self-limited mild bleeding in Groups A and B, respectively.
	- The mean procedure cost was significantly higher in the endoscopic PEG replacement group compared to the percutaneous PEG replacement group ($650 vs. $350, respectively).

In conclusion, percutaneous PEG replacement appears as safe as endoscopic PEG replacement; however, percutaneous tube exchange is less costly.

### Benefits and risks of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for decompression in patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction [^116eB2Bn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to examine the burdens caused by gastrointestinal obstruction in patients with end-stage abdominal cancer, such as nausea and vomiting. There is limited detailed data on the efficacy of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for decompression. This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the extent of symptom relief provided by PEG and the associated complications.

Chart reviews were conducted for 75 patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction who underwent PEG for decompression. The abstracted data included symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain, along with medication details up to 7 days before and after the intervention. Complications, demographics, potential influencing factors, and survival were also examined. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to determine symptom reduction.

The results showed that PEG decreased the mean frequency of vomiting per day from 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7–2.7) to 0.4 (95% CI 0.3–0.6), with a significant p-value of less than 0.001. The probability of experiencing nausea on a given day was reduced from 80% (95% CI 74–85%) before PEG placement to 40% (95% CI 34–47%) afterward (p < 0.001). A total of 112 complications were reported in 56 patients. Among these, 19 out of 75 patients (25%) experienced no complications, 52 out of 75 (69%) had minor complications, and 18 out of 75 (24%) had major complications. Stomal leakage (18 patients), mild wound pain (17 patients), and tube occlusion (13 patients) were the most frequent issues. The major complication with the highest occurrence was the failure of the first PEG placement attempt (7 patients).

In conclusion, PEG for decompression significantly reduces vomiting and nausea in patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (p < 0.001). Minor complications were more common compared to major ones.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^115HWiSq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Beyond merely prolonging life, the quality of living holds greater importance. Measuring quality of life consistently proves challenging. Most researchers assess health-related quality of life using specific questionnaires that evaluate essential components, including the physical, psychological, and social domains of health. Although objective dimensions are crucial in defining a patient's health status, for this study, specific questions were posed regarding caregivers' subjective perceptions and expectations. This approach translates their assessment into the actual quality of life experienced by caregivers or anticipated for their patients.

Overall, less than half of the respondents believed that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement improved the quality of life for both patients and families. This finding aligns with the results from a 2002 study. Most relatives anticipated that the intervention would enhance patient nutrition, though they understood that the PEG did not improve the patient's underlying illness. Additionally, many were skeptical about the resources required, including time and money, by the family for patient care following PEG tube insertion. This contrasts with the 2002 study, wherein relatives reported that post-PEG tube placement, managing the patient became easier (96%), the time required for patient care decreased (62%), and the cost of care was reduced (11%). Notably, there is no explanation provided for this discrepancy.

### Percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG) as an alternative long-term tube feeding procedure when gastrostomy is not feasible [^117GZmkk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Although percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an established procedure for long-term tube feeding in patients with dysphagia or inadequate oral intake, it may not be feasible in some patients. Well-recognized contraindications include severe ascites and advanced gastric cancer. A previous gastric resection (total or partial), interposing organs (such as the liver or transverse colon) between the abdominal wall and the anterior gastric wall, or disorders of the left diaphragm (like severe herniation or paralysis) also render some patients who need long-term tube feeding unsuitable for PEG. For these patients, the options available are often nasogastric tubing or laparoscopy (or laparotomy) to achieve percutaneous access to the gut.

Percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG) is a minimally invasive technique developed in Japan to access the gut via an esophagostomy. This procedure was initially developed for patients with malignant obstruction as an alternative to nasogastric decompression. Later on, it was also adopted to maintain long-term tube feeding in cases where PEG may be risky or not possible. However, despite being reported in the US more than 10 years ago, PTEG remains a technique unknown to most surgeons (or gastroenterologists) outside Japan, and the available literature regarding this method is still fairly limited. The procedure was developed in 1994 and has been receiving coverage from Japan's National Health Insurance since 2012. This observational study was conducted to investigate the clinical outcomes of PTEG as an alternative long-term tube feeding procedure.

### When is feeding via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy indicated [^116Gmgob]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

This review addresses controversies regarding appropriate indications for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. Specific indications discussed include dementia, stroke, aspiration, motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and head and neck cancer. We recommend practical strategies for improving patient selection.

There is now a general consensus in the United States that PEG feeding does not benefit patients with advanced dementia. 'Early' PEG insertion following stroke is similarly of no benefit. It is currently unclear whether patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and head and neck tumors should have PEG or radiologically inserted gastrostomy.

Decisions relating to PEG insertion remain difficult. The gastroenterologist, working as a member of a multidisciplinary nutrition team, needs to take a lead role in this regard, rather than functioning as a technician.

### Factors predicting early discharge and mortality in post-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy patients [^112FkTGc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Since its introduction in 1980, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become increasingly popular and has supplanted surgical gastrostomy as the procedure of choice for enteral nutrition in patients unable to partake of adequate oral feeds due to impairment of swallowing function or dementia. Despite its popularity, the beneficial effect of PEG is uncertain or limited to selected patients. The utility of PEG in stroke patients has not been validated. One study indicated that stroke patients with PEGs were more likely to have a higher complication rate and mortality when compared to those without PEGs. Likewise, PEG insertion has not shown to provide survival benefit in patients with dementia.

In patients with head and neck cancer, early placement of a PEG may enhance the nutritional status and facilitate treatment, but even this subset suffers from an overusage of PEGs. Notwithstanding its narrow scope of benefit, PEGs continue to be placed in significant numbers. Over 200,000 PEGs are performed annually in the United States.

Driving these numbers is an ethical nuance. Artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) is ethically and legally accepted as medical treatment. Healthcare providers, therefore, feel obligated to provide this 'medical' treatment, and family members are more likely to equate withholding ANH with 'starving a person to death'.

Apart from ethical and medical considerations, a logistic factor has been added to the equation, making a complex issue even more complicated. Nursing homes are increasingly insisting on PEG placement prior to…

### Radiological percutaneous gastrostomy [^111rkg3a]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Long-term gastrostomy tubes play a widely accepted role in providing nutritional support. Traditionally, these tubes have been placed by surgeons and endoscopists. However, in the last decade, radiologists have assumed a major role in the placement of gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy devices, often doing so as effectively and at a lesser expense.

A detailed technique for placement is explained, along with a discussion on patient selection and potential complications. Additionally, a review of the relevant literature is provided.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on outcomes and complications of percutaneous endoscopic versus radiologic gastrostomy for enteral feeding [^1155ddu3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The optimal technique for long-term enteral feeding has not yet been established. Both percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) are widely used. The aim was to extensively review the outcomes of PEG and PRG.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane was performed, utilizing standardized tools for assessing bias. The main outcomes were infectious and tube-related complications, procedure-related and 30-day mortality. Pooled risk differences (RDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects, and arcsine transformations were applied.

- **Results**: In total, 344 studies were identified, of which 16 were included, reporting on 934 PEGs and 1093 PRGs. No differences were found for infectious complications [RD, 0.03 (-0.05 to 0.11)], procedure-related mortality [RD, 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06)], or 30-day mortality [RD, 0.06 (-0.01 to 0.13)]. Tube-related complications were higher in PRG [RD, 0.16 (0.06–0.26)]. Subgroup analysis was performed for head and neck cancer (HNC) and motor neuron disease. In HNC, this revealed significantly lower tube-related complications and procedure-related mortality after PEG. In motor neuron disease, no differences were seen. The level of evidence appears sufficient considering the low degree of heterogeneity.

- **Conclusions**: No differences were found with regard to mortality or infectious complications. PEG showed a lower risk of tube-related complications. Subgroup analysis revealed PEG to be favorable in HNC based on lower rates of procedure-related complications.
