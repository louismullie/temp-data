is it receommended to put children on probiotics when on abx

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether children should be given probiotics when they are taking antibiotics, and if so, which strains, doses, and timing are supported by evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical outcome we're trying to prevent, namely antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for probiotics in pediatrics, including Cochrane reviews and randomized trials. Next, I will check guideline positions from major societies and weigh benefits versus risks. After that, I need to consider strain specificity, dosing, and timing. Finally, I should account for publication bias and formulate a practical, conditional recommendation with caveats for special populations and cost considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its baseline risk. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea occurs in roughly 19% of children receiving antibiotics, which establishes a meaningful absolute risk that makes prevention clinically relevant if effective and safe interventions exist [^7b03eb56].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The 2019 Cochrane review of 33 randomized trials including 6,352 children found that probiotics reduced AAD incidence from 19% to 8% (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36–0.56; NNT ≈ 9), with moderate-certainty evidence and no increase in serious adverse events, which is compelling for routine consideration in otherwise healthy children [^7b03eb56]. Wait, let me verify the dose-response claim: the same review suggested higher doses (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) were more effective than lower doses, supporting a practical dosing target when recommending probiotics [^7b03eb56].

> I will now examine which strains have the most consistent signal. Multiple meta-analyses and pediatric-focused reviews converge on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii as the best-supported agents for AAD prevention, with effect sizes around 40–60% relative risk reduction in pooled analyses, though heterogeneity exists and head-to-head trials are limited [^7b03eb56] [^cde94f39] [^2c568a52]. Hold on, I should verify that these effects are not simply due to low-quality studies; the Cochrane assessment rated the overall evidence as moderate quality despite heterogeneity, which strengthens confidence in a modest but real benefit [^7b03eb56].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. ESPGHAN 2023 recommends considering high-dose (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) L. rhamnosus GG or S. boulardii started simultaneously with antibiotics to prevent AAD in children, reflecting a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, which matches the Cochrane conclusions [^1da81050]. The AGA suggests specific probiotic formulations for prevention of C. difficile infection during antibiotic exposure, including S. boulardii and certain Lactobacillus combinations, albeit with low-certainty evidence and conditional recommendations, and notes that patients may reasonably choose not to use probiotics given heterogeneity and cost [^92c7735e] [^16b29b9c]. IDSA/SHEA does not recommend routine probiotics for primary prevention of C. difficile outside trials, citing low baseline risk and potential harms in high-risk hosts, which is a different question than AAD prevention and should not be conflated [^e00d7cce].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed carefully. Across pediatric RCTs, serious adverse events attributable to probiotics were not reported, and nonserious events were infrequent and similar to placebo, supporting a favorable safety profile in immunocompetent children. However, caution is warranted in severely ill, immunocompromised, or those with central venous catheters due to rare bacteremia/fungemia reports, so I should explicitly advise avoidance in those settings [^7b03eb56] [^a8fe6235]. But wait, what if the child is very young or has complex comorbidities? In those cases, I should individualize decisions and consider withholding probiotics pending specialist input [^7b03eb56].

> Now, I should confirm practical details: dose, timing, and duration. High-dose regimens of 5–40 billion CFU/day of L. rhamnosus GG or S. boulardii, started at the same time as antibiotics and continued for the antibiotic course plus an additional 7 days, are reasonable and evidence-aligned, with the extra week aiming to cover the period of microbiota vulnerability during and shortly after antibiotic exposure [^7b03eb56] [^1da81050]. Hold on, I should verify that starting concurrently is acceptable; yes, trials generally initiated probiotics within 24–48 hours of antibiotics without loss of effect, and starting early may better preserve barrier function and prevent pathogen overgrowth [^7b03eb56] [^4d00e491].

> I should double-check the magnitude of benefit to set expectations. With an NNT around 9–10, for every 10 children given a probiotic during antibiotics, approximately one fewer will develop AAD, which is a modest but clinically meaningful absolute benefit, especially when AAD can prolong illness, prompt additional visits, or lead to early antibiotic discontinuation [^7b03eb56] [^c7294b2e]. Let me reconsider whether this still holds after sensitivity analyses; the Cochrane results remained significant in ITT and extreme-case analyses, supporting robustness despite heterogeneity [^7b03eb56].

> Next, I should review potential limitations and biases. There is evidence that pediatric probiotic trials are less likely to be published than antibiotic trials, raising concern for selective publication inflating benefit estimates; thus, I should communicate that the true effect may be smaller than meta-analytic estimates, even though the direction is consistent across multiple analyses [^3bd7005f] [^52e6b867]. Hmm, wait a minute, does this negate the recommendation? No, but it reinforces a conditional stance and the need to use products with the best-supported strains and doses rather than assuming class effects [^7b03eb56].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility to ensure internal consistency. Probiotics may mitigate AAD via competitive exclusion of pathogens, enhancement of gut barrier integrity, modulation of immune responses, and production of short-chain fatty acids that improve colonic water absorption; recent pediatric data show transient increases in supplemented genera during co-administration with antibiotics, though diversity effects are small and revert after cessation, which aligns with a modest, strain-specific clinical benefit rather than broad microbiome restructuring [^0cb9c88c] [^526b94a0]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diversity restoration; current evidence does not support probiotics as a means to maintain global diversity during antibiotics, so I should avoid overstating that claim [^74343cf3].

> Putting this together, my conditional recommendation is as follows: for otherwise healthy children aged 3 months to 18 years who are starting antibiotics, it is reasonable to offer L. rhamnosus GG or S. boulardii at 5–40 billion CFU/day, begun at the same time as antibiotics and continued for the antibiotic course plus 7 additional days, to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This balances a modest but meaningful benefit with low apparent risk and aligns with moderate-quality evidence and pediatric gastroenterology guidance [^7b03eb56] [^1da81050]. I should confirm that families understand the NNT, cost, and the need to avoid use in immunocompromised or critically ill children, and I should document shared decision-making if they prefer not to add another supplement [^7b03eb56] [^a8fe6235].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address special situations. In children with severe illness, immunocompromise, central venous catheters, or those in the neonatal ICU, I should avoid routine probiotics due to infection risk and the lack of supportive safety data in these populations. In children with repeated antibiotic exposures or prior AAD, the absolute benefit may be greater, which can strengthen the case for prophylaxis after discussing uncertainties and costs [^7b03eb56] [^a8fe6235]. If a family cannot access or afford a product with the specific strains and doses used in trials, I should not substitute an untested product and should instead emphasize hydration, diet, and prompt evaluation if diarrhea develops [^7b03eb56].

Routine probiotic use is **not universally recommended** for all children on antibiotics, but **moderate-quality evidence** supports selective use to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) [^7b03eb56] [^e171af8f]. The most consistent benefit is with **Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii** at 5–40 billion CFU/day, started within 24–48 hours of antibiotics and continued for the antibiotic course plus 7 days [^7b03eb56] [^1da81050]. Probiotics are **generally safe**, but avoid in immunocompromised or critically ill children due to rare infection risk [^a8fe6235] [^1dd50304]. Routine use is not advised for low-risk children; consider when AAD risk is high (e.g. broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged courses, prior AAD) or if families prefer a low-risk option after counseling [^1da81050] [^9d630f24].

## Evidence for probiotic use in children receiving antibiotics

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses show that **probiotics reduce AAD risk** in children [^7b03eb56] [^13f3cdea]. The 2019 Cochrane review of 33 RCTs (6,352 children) found probiotics reduced AAD from 19% to 8% (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36–0.56; NNT 9) [^7b03eb56]. High-dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) were more effective than lower doses (RR 0.37 vs 0.68) [^7b03eb56]. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii had the most consistent benefit [^7b03eb56] [^cde94f39].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines offer **conditional support** for selective probiotic use in children on antibiotics:

- **ESPGHAN 2023**: Consider high-dose L. rhamnosus GG or S. boulardii (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) started with antibiotics and continued for 7 days after, especially when AAD risk is high (e.g. broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged courses, prior AAD) [^1da81050].
- **AGA 2020**: Suggests specific probiotic formulations (e.g. S. boulardii; L. acidophilus CL1285 + L. casei LBC80R) to prevent C. difficile infection in children on antibiotics, with low-certainty evidence and conditional recommendations [^92c7735e] [^16b29b9c].
- **IDSA/SHEA 2018**: Insufficient evidence to recommend routine probiotics for primary prevention of C. difficile infection in children [^e00d7cce].

---

## Safety considerations

Probiotics are **generally safe** in healthy children, with no serious adverse events reported in RCTs [^7b03eb56]. Rare infections (bacteremia, fungemia) have been reported in immunocompromised or critically ill patients, so probiotics should be avoided in these populations [^a8fe6235] [^1dd50304].

---

## Factors influencing probiotic efficacy

Several factors influence **efficacy**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on efficacy** |
|-|-|
| Probiotic strain | L. rhamnosus GG and S. boulardii have the most consistent evidence [^7b03eb56] [^cde94f39] |
| Dose | Higher doses (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) are more effective [^7b03eb56] |
| Timing | Start within 24–48 hours of antibiotic initiation [^notfound] |
| Duration | Continue for the antibiotic course plus 7 days [^c61be6e4] |
| Patient population | Greater benefit in high-risk children (e.g. broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged courses, prior AAD) [^1da81050] |

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for all children on antibiotics; consider selectively based on risk and family preference [^1da81050].
- **High-risk children**: Consider L. rhamnosus GG or S. boulardii at 5–40 billion CFU/day, started within 24–48 hours of antibiotics and continued for 7 days after the course [^7b03eb56] [^1da81050].
- **Low-risk children**: Routine probiotics are not necessary; counsel families on potential benefits and costs [^9d630f24].
- **Avoid**: Immunocompromised or critically ill children [^a8fe6235] [^1dd50304].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Probiotics are **not universally recommended** for all children on antibiotics, but **moderate-quality evidence** supports selective use to prevent AAD, particularly with L. rhamnosus GG or S. boulardii at 5–40 billion CFU/day, started early and continued for 7 days after antibiotics. Use is most appropriate in high-risk children or when families prefer a low-risk option after counseling, and should be avoided in immunocompromised or critically ill children.

Clinical Question

In adults and children prescribed antibiotics, is co-administration of a probiotic associated with a lower risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection without an increase in adverse events?

Bottom Line

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a lower risk of C difficile infection and very low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with fewer adverse events vs placebo or no treatment.

### What are the indications for using probiotics in children? [^959af9ba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The health benefits of probiotics have been the subject of extensive research. Still, some questions are being repeatedly asked: should one use or not use probiotics? If yes, how and when should probiotics be used? The purpose of this review is to summarise current evidence on specific probiotics' efficacy and safety to help healthcare professionals make evidence-based decisions on the indications for using specific probiotic strains or combinations in children. To identify relevant data, searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in July 2015 to locate randomised controlled trials or their meta-analyses published in the last fiveyears. The MEDLINE database also was searched for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, developed by scientific societies. Considering that probiotics have strain-specific effects, the main focus was on data on individual probiotic strains, not on probiotics in general.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^7a1fd705]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our meta-analysis suggested that during antibiotic treatment, taking probiotics as early as possible has a positive and safe effect on preventing antibiotic-related diarrhea in adults. However, further studies should focus on the optimal dosage and duration of probiotics and pay attention to the strain specificity to develop a specific recommendation.

### Probiotics for preventing acute otitis media in children [^27d5fbe8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM), or acute middle ear infection, is one of the most frequently occurring childhood diseases, and the most common reason given for prescribing antibiotics in this age group. Guidelines often recommend antibiotics as first-line treatment for severe AOM. However, antibiotics also lead to antibiotic resistance, so preventing episodes of AOM is an urgent priority.

Objectives

To assess the effects of probiotics to prevent the occurrence and reduce the severity of acute otitis media in children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and three other databases (October 2018), two trial registers (October 2018), and conducted a backwards and forwards citation analysis (August 2018). We did not apply any language, publication date, or publication status restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children (aged up to 18 years), comparing probiotics with placebo, usual care, or no probiotic.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials for inclusion and risk of bias of the included trials, and extracted data using pre-piloted data extraction forms. We analysed dichotomous data as either risk ratio (RR) or odds ratios (OR) and continuous data as mean differences (MD).

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs involving 3488 children, of which 16 RCTs were included in the meta-analyses. Of the 16 RCTs that reported the mean age of children, mean age overall was 2.4 years; in 4 RCTs the mean age of children participating in the trial was less than 1 year old; in 2 RCTs the mean age was between 1 and 2 years old; and in 10 RCTs the mean age was older than 2 years. Probiotic strains evaluated by the trials varied, with 11 of the included RCTs evaluating Lactobacillus-containing probiotics, and six RCTs evaluating Streptococcus-containing probiotics.The proportion of children (i.e. the number of children in each group) experiencing one or more episodes of AOM during the treatment was lower for those taking probiotics (RR 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.93; 16 trials; 2961 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; moderate-certainty evidence).Post hoc subgroup analysis found that among children not prone to otitis media, a lower proportion of children receiving probiotics experienced AOM (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84; 11 trials; 2227 participants; NNTB = 9; moderate-certainty evidence). However, among children who were otitis prone, there was no difference between probiotic and comparator groups (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11; 5 trials; 734 participants; high-certainty evidence). The test for subgroup differences was significant (P = 0.007).None of the included trials reported on the severity of AOM.The proportion of children experiencing adverse events did not differ between the probiotic and comparator groups (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.94; 4 trials; 395 participants; low-certainty evidence).Probiotics decreased the proportion of children taking antibiotics for any infection (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86; 8 trials; 1768 participants; NNTB = 8; moderate-certainty evidence). Test for subgroup differences (use of antibiotic specifically for AOM, use of antibiotic for infections other than AOM) was not significant.There was no difference in the mean number of school days lost (MD -0.95, 95% CI -2.47 to 0.57; 5 trials; 1280 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in the level of compliance in taking the intervention (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.05; 5 trials; 990 participants).Probiotics decreased the proportion of children having other infections (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 11 trials; 3610 participants; NNTB = 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Test for subgroup differences (acute respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections) was not significant.Probiotic strains trialled and their dose, frequency, and duration of administration varied considerably across studies, which likely contributed to the substantial levels of heterogeneity. Sensitivity testing of funnel plots did not reveal publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Probiotics may prevent AOM in children not prone to AOM, but the inconsistency of the subgroup analyses suggests caution in interpreting these results. Probiotics decreased the proportion of children taking antibiotics for any infection. The proportion of children experiencing adverse events did not differ between the probiotic and comparator groups. The optimal strain, duration, frequency, and timing of probiotic administration still needs to be established.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children [^3fbc5267]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

This article provides recommendations, developed by the Working Group (WG) on Probiotics of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, for the use of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic reviews and of randomized controlled trials published subsequently to these reviews. The use of probiotics for the treatment of AAD is not covered. The recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 randomized controlled trials that used a given probiotic (with strain specification) were available. The quality of evidence (QoE) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines. If the use of probiotics for preventing AAD is considered because of the existence of risk factors such as class of antibiotic(s), duration of antibiotic treatment, age, need for hospitalization, comorbidities, or previous episodes of AAD diarrhea, the WG recommends using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (moderate QoE, strong recommendation) or Saccharomyces boulardii (moderate QoE, strong recommendation). If the use of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is considered, the WG suggests using S boulardii (low QoE, conditional recommendation). Other strains or combinations of strains have been tested, but sufficient evidence is still lacking.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^404ce26a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline on probiotics—conclusions states that probiotics hold promise for digestive and nondigestive disorders, with clear evidence of benefit in specific circumstances such as acute viral gastrointestinal tract infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), although effects can be modest and evidence is not clear enough to support use in a variety of disorders. When prescribing probiotics, one must consider the probiotic formulation, including live, dead, compounded preparations or their products, the effective dose to use and the type of disease targeted, and recognize that “not all probiotics are created equal,” so actions or properties cannot be generalized across doses or strains. The US Food and Drug Administration does not currently regulate probiotic products; thus, there is no governing agency overlooking quality control and the actual number of viable organisms in commercial products may be quite different from what is being advertised. Future large-scale clinical trials controlling dosing, viability and other critical variables will be crucial to determine efficacy.

### Prophylactic use of probiotics for gastrointestinal disorders in children [^3e61b3cf]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2019). High credibility.

The gastrointestinal microbiome is a hot topic in clinical research. Beneficial effects of selected probiotics in the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders are mainly restricted to acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, infantile colic, and necrotising enterocolitis. However, no broad consensus exists to recommend the use of probiotics in the prevention of these conditions, mainly because of the different design of the studies done so far, resulting in little evidence for specific strains, dosages, and indications. More well designed studies are needed before recommendations can be proposed. At this stage, the evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of probiotics in infants and children for the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders.

### Comparison of publication of pediatric probiotic vs antibiotic trials registered on clinicalTrials.gov [^789524c9]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do registered trials that evaluate the use of probiotics and routinely used antibiotics in children differ in their publication rates?

Findings

This cross-sectional analysis of 265 unique probiotic trials and 136 unique antibiotic trials in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry found that among registered trials conducted in children, probiotic trials are less likely to be published than antibiotic trials after adjustment for funding source, presence of blinding, and study purpose. No other evaluated study characteristics were independently associated with publication status in the regression model.

Meaning

These findings suggest that pediatric probiotic trials may be more prone to selective publication compared with pediatric antibiotic trials; therefore, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of probiotics must be interpreted cautiously.

### Recommendations for probiotic use [^9023f280]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative and dose-ranging trials.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^c7246cf2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via restoration of the gut microflora. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and AAD is common in this population.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. To assess adverse events associated with the use of probiotics when co-administered with antibiotics in children.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL , AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to August 2006) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group, CISCOM, Chalmers PedCAM Research Register and trial registries from inception to 2005. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled (placebo, active, or no treatment) trials comparing co-administered probiotics with antibiotics for the prevention of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use in children (0 to 18 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors (BCJ, AS). Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using pooled relative risks, and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were summarized using risk difference. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, a priori sensitivity analyses included per protocol versus intention to treat, random versus fixed effects, and methodological quality criterion. Subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic agent.

Main Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination. Six studies used a single strain probiotic agent and four combined two probiotic strains. The per protocol analysis for 9/10 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show statistically significant results favouring probiotics over active/non active controls (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74). However, intention to treat analysis showed non-significant results overall (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.63). Five of ten trials monitored for adverse events (n = 647); none reported a serious adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

Probiotics show promise for the prevention of pediatric AAD. While per protocol analysis yields treatment effect estimates that are both statistically and clinically significant, as does analysis of high quality studies, the estimate from the intention to treat analysis was not statistically significant. Future studies should involve probiotic strains and doses with the most promising evidence (e.g., Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus sporogenes, Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day). Research done to date does not permit determination of the effect of age (e.g., infant versus older children) or antibiotic duration (e.g., 5 days versus 10 days). Future trials would benefit from a validated primary outcome measure for antibiotic-associated diarrhea that is sensitive to change and reflects what treatment effect clinicians, parents, and children consider important. The current data are promising, but it is premature to routinely recommend probiotics for the prevention of pediatric AAD.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^74343cf3]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The relatively small number of publications and the wide range of methods and diversity indices used across the eligible articles indicate that microbiome diversity is an under-researched area and that professional consensus is still lacking. Although recommendations for the conduct and reporting of microbiome research have been published, there are no standards for the choice of diversity indices. Moreover, every year, new approaches to characterize microbiome composition are emerging, making standardization increasingly difficult. Similarly, the relationship of microbiome composition and its changes with physiological functions and clinical symptoms is not well understood yet: no evident clinical characteristics or symptoms can be attributed to the different diversity index values, especially their numerical variation. Our results suggest that the routine use of probiotics is not justified for maintaining gut microbial balance and diversity. This is particularly important for outpatients who are at low risk and usually start taking probiotics for this purpose. This finding is in accordance with the current AGA recommendation, which also highlights that patients with low risk would reasonably select no probiotics, thus avoiding potential harm and additional costs. In order to determine the exact role of probiotics in the clinic, these questions need to be answered through further professional discussion and intensive research.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^36e41e03]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in children. Currently, antibiotic prescription rates range from 0.5 to 1.6 courses per child-year in Western countries.Exposure to antibiotics results in a decreased diversity and abundance of commensal microorganisms with a concurrent increase of pathogens in the gut microbiota. In early life, gut microbiota play an important role in multiple physiologic processes, including priming and development of the immune system and digestion.Consequently, antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, particularly during early childhood, has been associated with long-term health outcomes such as obesity, asthma, Crohn disease, and type 1 diabetes.,, In the short term, the most common adverse effect is antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).Since prescription of antibiotics cannot always be avoided, it is pivotal to study interventions that could prevent, mitigate, or quickly restore antibiotic-induced microbial alterations and adverse events in children.

The most thoroughly studied intervention to prevent harms of antibiotic use consists of probiotics, defined as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”Recently, we demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that supplementation of a multispecies probiotic in antibiotic-exposed children resulted in a significantly decreased risk of diarrhea.It has been hypothesized that concomitant supplementation of probiotics during antibiotic therapy may protect against such antibiotic-induced adverse events by modulating the microbiota. However, the presumed underlying protective mechanisms of probiotics, including their mitigating effects on antibiotic-induced microbiota aberrations, have not yet been thoroughly studied in children.Therefore, we longitudinally assessed the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the microbiota composition in children receiving antibiotics.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^5077c0df]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in children. They alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract, commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via restoration of the gut microflora.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to November 2014) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as well as risk of bias. We also conducted post hoc subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Twenty-three studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; I(2) = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; I(2) = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61) probiotic effect with a NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^fa5d5e76]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Population or participants

When choosing the study population, many parameters need to be defined, including the target host (including non-human species), target life stage (for example, pregnant women, infants, children, adults or elderly) and health status (for example, healthy, at-risk, or with a diagnosed disease or condition). Furthermore, microbiome-related factors, such as recent probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic or antibiotic use, microbiota-disrupting medications and diet can be considered as (in)eligibility criteria, depending on primary health and microbiota outcomes. A 2-week wash-in period is generally adequate for probiotics; however, certain populations might require longer wash-in periods (such as 4 weeks for those with slow transit time). The time since last antibiotic exposure will vary depending on a range of factors, including type of antibiotic, dose, duration and whether antibiotic use has occurred on multiple occasions in fairly short succession,. A general recommendation is difficult to make, although a common exclusion is individuals who have taken antibiotics 3 months prior to a study. However, at a minimum, 4 weeks since cessation of antibiotics is recommended. Non-antibiotic prescription medications should also be considered if they can influence bowel function and the microbiome.

The population subgroups of interest should be specified. Clinical factors (such as sex or BMI), baseline microbiome features (such as presence of specific microbial taxa) and other microbiome-relevant factors (such as dietary fibre intake, maternal secretor status for studies on human milk oligosaccharides or birth mode) might be relevant to analyse. For studies on the elderly, consider age-associated differences in transit time, gastric acidity and diet diversity. For mother–infant dyads, consider possible vertical transmission of microorganisms from mother to infant in breast milk, microorganisms and substrates naturally present in breast milk, and the unique characteristics of immature infant microbiome.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^7b03eb56]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Thirty-three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control.After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow-up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P <0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow-up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P <0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence).None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow-up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; P < 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation.After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.44; P <0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use.

Authors' Conclusions

The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed multi-centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^cfce708e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C. difficile prevention strategy. Recent clinical practice guidelines do not recommend probiotic prophylaxis, even though probiotics have the highest quality evidence among cited prophylactic therapies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing C.difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 21 March 2017. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (independently and in duplicate) extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included detection of C. difficile infection in stool, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group, we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias as well as a post hoc subgroup analysis on baseline risk of CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Thirty-nine studies (9955 participants) met the eligibility requirements for our review. Overall, 27 studies were rated as either high or unclear risk of bias. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) among trials investigating CDAD (31 trials, 8672 participants) suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60%. The incidence of CDAD was 1.5% (70/4525) in the probiotic group compared to 4.0% (164/4147) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; GRADE = moderate). Twenty-two of 31 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and results were similar whether considering subgroups of trials in adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, or studies at high versus low risk of bias. However, in a post hoc analysis, we did observe a subgroup effect with respect to baseline risk of developing CDAD. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0% to 2% and 3% to 5% did not show any difference in risk but trials enrolling participants with a baseline risk of > 5% for developing CDAD demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction (interaction P value = 0.01). Among studies with a baseline risk > 5%, the incidence of CDAD in the probiotic group was 3.1% (43/1370) compared to 11.6% (126/1084) in the control group (13 trials, 2454 participants; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42; GRADE = moderate). With respect to detection of C. difficile in the stool pooled complete case results from 15 trials (1214 participants) did not show a reduction in infection rates. C. difficile infection was 15.5% (98/633) in the probiotics group compared to 17.0% (99/581) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10; GRADE = moderate). Adverse events were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; GRADE = very low). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials including 8672 patients, moderate certainty evidence suggests that probiotics are effective for preventing CDAD (NNTB = 42 patients, 95% CI 32 to 58). Our post hoc subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity indicated that probiotics are effective among trials with a CDAD baseline risk >5% (NNTB = 12; moderate certainty evidence), but not among trials with a baseline risk ≤5% (low to moderate certainty evidence). Although adverse effects were reported among 32 included trials, there were more adverse events among patients in the control groups. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^ce741b15]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Probiotics across gastrointestinal conditions—evidence limitations and use statements include the following: Based on the accompanying technical review, the current evidence suggests that certain probiotic strains or combinations may prevent C difficile infections for adults and children on antibiotic treatment; however, the quality of evidence was low and the reporting of harms was not always consistent, so it would be reasonable to select not to use probiotics in those with severe illnesses or immunosuppression. For children with acute gastroenteritis in North America, the current evidence does not support the use of probiotics. The authors highlight significant heterogeneity between studies, variability in the probiotic strains studied, and a lack of consistent harms reporting and product manufacturing details that prohibit true comparisons and decrease feasibility for patients. The technical review found a significant knowledge gap in treatment of C difficile and similar knowledge gaps in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, and these guidelines will undergo review and consideration for an update within 3–5 years or earlier if practice-changing evidence becomes available.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^56d4fed4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We present here a workflow for the assessment of the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The workflow consists of a series of steps (systematic review of available literature and meta-analysis of relevant clinical trials, inventory of available products and formulation of evidence-based recommendations) that can be applied to other cases, upon adaptation of methodological details such as the inclusion criteria. In order to make strong, evidence-based recommendations it is important that research of high-quality is available, in which adequate methods are followed to perform the trials and to report the results. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of specific probiotic products for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea. In particular, we provide a three-star recommendation for preparations with a minimal daily dose of 2 × 10 9 CFU of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.

### Recommending oral probiotics to reduce winter antibiotic prescriptions in people with asthma: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^4c0ec40e]. Annals of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Evidence from studies mainly in children has shown that orally administered probiotics may prevent respiratory tract infections and associated antibiotic use. We evaluated whether advice to take daily probiotics can reduce antibiotic prescribing for winter respiratory tract infections in people with asthma.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled, parallel-group pragmatic study for participants aged 5 years and older with asthma in a UK primary care setting. The intervention was a postal leaflet with advice to take daily probiotics from October 2013 to March 2014, compared with a standard winter advice leaflet. Primary outcome was the proportion of participants prescribed antibiotics for respiratory tract infections.

Results

There were 1,302 participants randomly assigned to a control group (n = 650) or intervention group (n = 652). There was no significant difference in the primary outcome measure, with 27.7% receiving antibiotics in the intervention group and 26.9% receiving antibiotics in the control group (odds ratio = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82-1.34). Uptake of probiotics was low, but outcomes were similar in those who accessed probiotics (adjusted odds ratio = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.69-1.69, compared with controls). We also found no evidence of an effect on respiratory tract infections or asthma exacerbations.

Conclusions

In this pragmatic community-based trial in people with asthma, we found no evidence that advising use of winter probiotics reduces antibiotic prescribing.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^15352f11]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment may disturb the resistance of gastrointestinal flora to colonization. This may result in complications, the most serious of which is Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving antibiotics.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Web of Science, and 12 gray-literature sources.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials including adult or pediatric patients receiving antibiotics that compared any strain or dose of a specified probiotic with placebo or with no treatment control and reported the incidence of CDAD.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles; extracted data on populations, interventions, and outcomes; and assessed risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines were used to independently rate overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome.

Data Synthesis

Twenty trials including 3818 participants met the eligibility criteria. Probiotics reduced the incidence of CDAD by 66% (pooled relative risk, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.49]; I(2) = 0%). In a population with a 5% incidence of antibiotic-associated CDAD (median control group risk), probiotic prophylaxis would prevent 33 episodes (CI, 25 to 38 episodes) per 1000 persons. Of probiotic-treated patients, 9.3% experienced adverse events, compared with 12.6% of control patients (relative risk, 0.82 [CI, 0.65 to 1.05]; I(2) = 17%).

Limitations

In 13 trials, data on CDAD were missing for 5% to 45% of patients. The results were robust to worst-plausible assumptions regarding event rates in studies with missing outcome data.

Conclusion

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotic prophylaxis results in a large reduction in CDAD without an increase in clinically important adverse events.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^742fa67f]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Disease

Exposure to antibiotics is the most important modifiable risk factor for development of CDI. Antibiotic stewardship programs that target reduction of inappropriate use in adults have proven helpful in reducing CDI rates, though comparable data in children are needed.Stewardship efforts are also needed in the outpatient setting, with at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions estimated to be unnecessary.Probiotics have been used as a preventative measure for C. difficile in an attempt to restore some of the microbial disruption caused by antibiotics, the benefit of which is still debated. A large systematic review reported the risk of CDI was lowered 60% with probiotics. Conversely, in a recent trial of hospitalized children who received antibiotics randomized to receive Lactobacillus reuteri (2 × 10 8 CFU) or placebo twice daily for the duration of antibiotic treatment, no difference in prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea was found.The wide heterogeneity in formulations, dose, and optimal timing casts uncertainty on the generalizability of probiotics for CDI prevention. The 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines state there is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend use for primary prevention of CDIProbiotics are generally well tolerated, though caution with use in severely immunocompromised or debilitated patients is needed and the cost to families must also be factored if used.

Other novel preventative approaches aimed at promoting colonization resistance by binding concomitantly administered antibiotics, such as activated charcoal and the oral β-lactamase ribaxamase, are under exploration. Demonstration of protection against disease by antibodies to toxin supports ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine, but both toxin based and nontoxin based candidates are much further away from use in children.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^adc628dc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Although our recommendations are based on different criteria and are not limited to children, they are in line with those of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) working group. The strain L. rhamnosus GG, for which we make a three-star recommendation, was also strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD in children by the ESPGHAN working group, on the basis of a moderate quality of evidence. The working group also gave a strong recommendation to S. boulardii. However, we could not do the same on the basis of our analysis, because we pooled results of patients of different ages. In the forest plot in Additional file 4, S. boulardii shows a positive effect in the prevention of AAD in children, a positive trend in adults, but no positive effect in elderly. Age is one of the factors that should be taken into account when evaluating health benefits of probiotics. In general, differences in the inclusion criteria, in the methods used to conduct the meta-analysis and in the criteria used to formulate recommendations will result in different evidence-based advice.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^a7344e73]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota, which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C difficile infection prevention strategy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of probiotics for preventing C difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children receiving an antibiotic for any reason.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase from 18 March 2017 (search date of the previous version of the review) to 3 March 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials with a placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no-treatment control investigating probiotics (any strain or dose) for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving an antibiotic for any reason.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was incidence of CDAD. Important outcomes included detection of C difficile in stool (i.e. colonization in absence of symptoms), adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and length of hospital stay.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We pooled dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) using a random-effects complete-case model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of missing outcome data on benefits and harms outcomes. To investigate heterogeneity, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses on risk of bias, probiotic dose, probiotic species, adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, and the event rate in the control group for developing CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

Eight new studies (n = 4595) met our inclusion criteria, for a total of 47 included studies (n = 15,260). Although we noted a high risk of bias in individual studies for sequence generation or allocation concealment, this did not impact our findings. Around 30% of studies lacked a published protocol or clinical trial registration, and in some cases there were inconsistencies between the reported methods and published results. We noted authors' affiliation with a probiotic company and financial support received from probiotic companies in 28 studies.

Synthesis Of Results

Evidence from 38 trials (13,179 participants) suggests that probiotics may result in a small absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.6% (incidence of 1.6% [110/6787] in the probiotic group versus 3.2% [203/6392] in the control group), and a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.64; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) in incidence of CDAD. Twenty-seven of 38 trials had missing CDAD data, ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete-case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data. Pooled results from 16 trials (1302 participants) suggest that probiotics may result in a small absolute reduction in C difficile in stool (i.e. colonization in absence of symptoms) (ARR 2.1%; incidence of 14.9% [101/677] in the probiotic group versus 16.2% [101/625] in the control group; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.11; P = 0.27; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-seven studies (11,911 participants) reported on adverse events. Our pooled analysis indicates that probiotics probably result in a small ARR of 1.7% (incidence of 10.9% [669/6148] in the probiotic group versus 12.2% [701/5763] in the control group), and an RRR of 14.0% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01; P = 0.074; moderate-certainty evidence). The most common adverse events in both the treatment and control groups were abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. Pooled results from 40 studies (13,419 participants) suggest that probiotics may result in a large ARR of 9% (incidence of 23% [1592/6901] in the probiotic group versus 27.4% [1787/6518] in the control group), and an RRR of 33% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.78; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) in incidence of AAD. Only seven trials (6553 participants) investigated length of hospital stay. There is likely little to no difference in length of hospital stay between treatment and control groups (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.21; P = 0.63; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for CDAD and AAD due to the low number of events or publication bias. We observed some variability in CDAD control group event rate (< 2% to > 5%) that may impact the applicability of evidence depending on clinical setting. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events due to variation between the results of the studies and for hospital stay due to selective reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence suggests that probiotics may be effective for preventing CDAD, suggesting that for every 65 people taking probiotics, one case of CDAD may be prevented (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 65, 95% CI 48 to 97). There are probably fewer adverse events in the probiotic group. The short-term use of probiotics may have a small absolute benefit, and is likely not associated with adverse effects when used in patient populations receiving systemic antibiotics who are not immunocompromised. Large trials comparing probiotics with placebo in people with a low baseline risk of CDAD are needed.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^e00d7cce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Probiotics for primary prevention of CDI—recommendation and rationale: There are insufficient data at this time to recommend administration of probiotics for primary prevention of CDI outside of clinical trials (no recommendation). Although several meta-analyses indicate probiotics may be effective at preventing CDI in patients on antibiotics without prior CDI, the typical CDI incidence among hospitalized people >65 years of age on antibiotics with a length of stay ≥2 days is ≤3%, and influential trials reported placebo CDI incidence 7–20 times higher than expected. There is also the potential for organisms in probiotic formulations to cause infections in hospitalized patients, and due to these issues there are insufficient data to recommend administration of probiotics for primary prevention of CDI.

### Microbial preparations (probiotics) for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: an individual patient data meta-analysis of 6, 851 participants [^79443275]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVETo determine whether probiotic prophylaxes reduce the odds of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in adults and children.DESIGNIndividual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adjusting for risk factors.METHODSWe searched 6 databases and 11 grey literature sources from inception to April 2016. We identified 32 RCTs (n=8,713); among them, 18 RCTs provided IPD (n=6,851 participants) comparing probiotic prophylaxis to placebo or no treatment (standard care). One reviewer prepared the IPD, and 2 reviewers extracted data, rated study quality, and graded evidence quality.RESULTSProbiotics reduced CDI odds in the unadjusted model (n=6,645; odds ratio [OR] 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.55) and the adjusted model (n=5,074; OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23-0.55). Using 2 or more antibiotics increased the odds of CDI (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.11-4.37), whereas age, sex, hospitalization status, and high-risk antibiotic exposure did not. Adjusted subgroup analyses suggested that, compared to no probiotics, multispecies probiotics were more beneficial than single-species probiotics, as was using probiotics in clinical settings where the CDI risk is ≥5%. Of 18 studies, 14 reported adverse events. In 11 of these 14 studies, the adverse events were retained in the adjusted model. Odds for serious adverse events were similar for both groups in the unadjusted analyses (n=4,990; OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.26) and adjusted analyses (n=4,718; OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89-1.28). Missing outcome data for CDI ranged from 0% to 25.8%. Our analyses were robust to a sensitivity analysis for missingness.CONCLUSIONSModerate quality (ie, certainty) evidence suggests that probiotic prophylaxis may be a useful and safe CDI prevention strategy, particularly among participants taking 2 or more antibiotics and in hospital settings where the risk of CDI is ≥5%.TRIAL REGISTRATIONPROSPERO 2015 identifier: CRD42015015701Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2018;771-781.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^2c568a52]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD)—effectiveness of specific probiotics: Two meta-analyses suggest a reduction in AAD by approxi- mately 60%, with S. boulardii effective in adults and Lactobacillus GG effective in children; a recent meta-analysis of data from 5 randomized controlled trials showed S. boulardii to be moderately effective in preventing AAD in children and adults treated with antibiotics, and for every 10 patients treated, 1 will not develop AAD; however, Lactobacillus acidophilus with L. bulgaricus was ineffective in children on amoxicillin and Lactobacillus GG failed to outperform placebo in 302 hospitalized adult patients receiving antibiotics.

### Probiotics for the management of pediatric gastrointestinal disorders: position paper of the ESPGHAN special interest group on gut microbiota and modifications [^002468ec]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host, are widely used despite uncertainty regarding their efficacy and discordant recommendations about their use. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Special Interest Group on Gut Microbiota and Modifications provides updated recommendations for the use of probiotics for the management of selected pediatric gastrointestinal disorders.

Methods

All systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, as well as subsequently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (until December 2021), that compared the use of probiotics in all delivery vehicles and formulations, at any dose, with no probiotic (ie, placebo or no treatment), were eligible for inclusion. The recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 RCTs on a similar well-defined probiotic strain were available. The modified Delphi process was used to establish consensus on the recommendations.

Results

Recommendations for the use of specific probiotic strains were made for the management of acute gastroenteritis, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis, management of Helicobacter pylori infection, and management of functional abdominal pain disorders and infant colic.

Conclusions

Despite evidence to support the use of specific probiotics in some clinical situations, further studies confirming the effect(s) and defining the type, dose, and timing of probiotics are still often required. The use of probiotics with no documented health benefits should be discouraged.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^526b94a0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Probiotics are often considered in children to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, the underlying mechanistic effects and impact of probiotics on antibiotic-induced microbiota changes are not well understood.

Objective

To investigate the effects of a multispecies probiotic on the gut microbiota composition in children receiving antibiotics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial from February 1, 2018, to May 31, 2021, including 350 children receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Patients were followed up until 1 month after the intervention period. Fecal samples and data were analyzed between September 1, 2022, and February 28, 2023. Eligibility criteria included 3 months to 18 years of age and recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 participated in the trial.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive daily placebo or a multispecies probiotic formulation consisting of 8 strains from 5 different genera during antibiotic treatment and for 7 days afterward.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Fecal stool samples were collected at 4 predefined times: (1) inclusion, (2) last day of antibiotic use, (3) last day of the study intervention, and (4) 1 month after intervention. Microbiota analysis was performed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.

Results

A total of 350 children were randomized and collected stool samples from 88 were eligible for the microbiota analysis (54 boys and 34 girls; mean [SD] age, 47.09 [55.64] months). Alpha diversity did not significantly differ between groups at the first 3 times. Shannon diversity (mean [SD], 3.56 [0.75] vs 3.09 [1.00]; P=.02) and inverse Simpson diversity (mean [SD], 3.75 [95% CI, 1.66-5.82] vs -1.31 [95% CI, -3.17 to 0.53]; P= 1 × 10-4) indices were higher in the placebo group compared with the probiotic group 1 month after intervention. Beta diversity was not significantly different at any of the times. Three of 5 supplemented genera had higher relative abundance during probiotic supplementation, but this difference had disappeared after 1 month.

Conclusions and Relevance

The studied probiotic mixture had minor and transient effects on the microbiota composition during and after antibiotic treatment. Further research is needed to understand their working mechanisms in manipulating the microbiome and preventing antibiotic-associated dysbiosis and adverse effects such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^66a2097a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely prescribed; however they can cause disturbances in gastrointestinal flora which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live organisms thought to balance the gastrointestinal flora.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) or C. difficile infection in adults and children.

Search Methods

On February 21, 2013 we searched PubMed (1966-2013), EMBASE (1966-2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), CINAHL (1982-2013), AMED (1985-2013), and ISI Web of Science. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search including contact with industry representatives.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently and in duplicate extracted data and assessed risk of bias using pre-constructed, and piloted, data extraction forms. Any disagreements were resolved by a third adjudicator. For articles published in abstract form only, further information was sought by contacting principal authors. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of C. difficile infection, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias.The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

A total of 1871 studies were identified with 31 (4492 participants) meeting eligibility requirements for our review. Overall 11 studies were rated as a high risk of bias due mostly to missing outcome data. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) of those trials investigating CDAD (23 trials, 4213 participants) suggests that probiotics significantly reduce this risk by 64%. The incidence of CDAD was 2.0% in the probiotic group compared to 5.5% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51). Sixteen of 23 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 5% to 45%. These results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and were similar whether considering trials in adults versus children, lower versus higher doses, different probiotic species, or higher versus lower risk of bias. Our judgment is that the overall evidence warrants moderate confidence in this large relative risk reduction. We downgraded the overall quality of evidence for CDAD to 'moderate' due to imprecision. There were few events (154) and the calculated optimal information size (n = 8218) was more than the total sample size. With respect to the incidence of C. difficile infection, a secondary outcome, pooled complete case results from 13 trials (961 participants) did not show a statistically significant reduction. The incidence of C. difficile infection was 12.6% in the probiotics group compared to 12.7% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24). Adverse events were assessed in 26 studies (3964 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 20% (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. For the short-term use of probiotics in patients that are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated, we consider the strength of this evidence to be moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that probiotics are both safe and effective for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.

### Probiotic use in clinical practice: what are the risks? [^a8fe6235]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics have been advocated for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of diseases, and there is strong evidence for their efficacy in some clinical scenarios. Probiotics are now widely used in many countries by consumers and in clinical practice. Given the increasingly widespread use of probiotics, a thorough understanding of their risks and benefits is imperative. In this article we review the safety of probiotics and discuss areas of uncertainty regarding their use. Although probiotics have an excellent overall safety record, they should be used with caution in certain patient groups-particularly neonates born prematurely or with immune deficiency. Because of the paucity of information regarding the mechanisms through which probiotics act, appropriate administrative regimens, and probiotic interactions, further investigation is needed in these areas. Finally, note that the properties of different probiotic species vary and can be strain-specific. Therefore, the effects of one probiotic strain should not be generalized to others without confirmation in separate studies. Careful consideration should be given to these issues before patients are advised to use probiotic supplements in clinical practice.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^1dd50304]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Probiotics as prophylaxis

Probiotics are “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”. The core benefit of probiotics is exercised by contributing to the maintenance of a balanced microbiota and therefore by creating a favorable gut environment. Furthermore, probiotics support the health of the digestive tract and the immune system. The positive effect of probiotics on gut health in a variety of conditions (antibiotic-associated and infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, etc.) has been evaluated by a number of randomized controlled clinical trials. Probiotics can antagonize pathogenic microorganisms in a variety of ways. They can compete with pathogens for nutrients and adhesion sites on the gastrointestinal mucosa in the process of competitive exclusion. They can also prevent pathogenicity by interfering with signaling between pathogens by degrading quorum sensing molecules. In addition, direct antagonism can occur through the production of bacteriocins or metabolites with antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms. Finally, probiotics are able to modulate and stimulate local and systemic immune responses in the patient.

According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) there is not enough information to confidently judge the safety of probiotic-based interventions. This is because many clinical trials do not adequately document adverse events, and also because rare adverse events are difficult to assess. Still, probiotic products are generally regarded as safe, and they are used both by healthy and ill people globally. Possible safety concerns include diseases such as bacteremia and fungemia, and are especially concerning for patients with a weakened or compromised immune system (critically ill infants, post-surgery and hospitalized patients, immuno-compromised patients are at high risk). Additionally, probiotics can constitute a source of antibiotic resistance genes. Although commercial probiotic strain are tested for the presence of such genes, reports have documented the presence of antibiotic resistance in probiotic bacteria from dietary supplements.

Scope of the paper

In this paper we present a practical guide to the use of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The guide is based on available scientific evidence and developed by following a workflow in three steps: 1) evaluation of the efficacy of probiotics in the context of AAD and identification of effective strains/formulations by a systematic review of relevant clinical trials and meta-analysis of their results; 2) identification of probiotic products available to the target population; 3) recommendation of specific probiotic products matching effective formulations. The scope of this guide is to inform healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD.

### Perspectives from the society for pediatric research: probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^9d630f24]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

However, in the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association’s clinical practice guidelines on the use of probiotics, they do not comment on the use of probiotics for prevention of non- C. diff icile colitis. The authors do, however, offer a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence to use probiotics to prevent C. diff icile colitis in children on antibiotics.

Much like the prior two conditions discussed, the significant heterogeneity in the literature on the use of probiotics in AAD is problematic when making recommendations regarding their use. There are also additional clinical considerations regarding the clinical use of probiotics for AAD. First, most patients may need to pay for probiotics “out of pocket,” which may present a financial burden. This concern is an important balancing measure to consider when deciding to initiate probiotics for the prevention of AAD, especially given that not every child given antibiotics will develop AAD. Overall, the number needed to treat to prevent AAD is approximately 11. While this is a reasonable number needed to treat, it is an important consideration when weighing the decision to prescribe probiotics for a patient for whom the cost of probiotics is prohibitive. Additionally, while probiotics are generally safe and well tolerated, there is the possibility that the increased complexity of the medication regimen may affect patient adherence with the antibiotic therapy. Indeed, the number of doses of medications has been demonstrated to be a factor in patient non-adherence with medication regimens in patients with chronic diseases. – Finally, there is little oversight of the production and quality of commercially available probiotics. This was highlighted in a study of 14 commercially available probiotics, which found that only 1 of the 14 products studied contained the exact organisms listed on the label.

### Probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cde94f39]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children.

Study Design

The following electronic databases up to December 2005, in any language, were searched for studies relevant to AAD and probiotics: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) were considered for study inclusion.

Results

Six placebo-controlled, RCTs (766 children) were included. Treatment with probiotics compared with placebo reduced the risk of AAD from 28.5% to 11.9% (relative risk, RR, 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.77, random effect model). Preplanned subgroup analysis showed that reduction of the risk of AAD was associated with the use of Lactobacillus GG (2 RCTs, 307 participants, RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.6), S. boulardii (1 RCT, 246 participants, RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.6), or B. lactis & Str. thermophilus (1 RCT, 157 participants, RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.95).

Conclusions

Probiotics reduce the risk of AAD in children. For every 7 patients that would develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, one fewer will develop AAD if also receiving probiotics.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^405ef4c7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this secondary analysis of an RCT, we investigated the effect of probiotic supplementation on antibiotic-associated microbiota aberrations in children. Alpha diversity did not differ between the 2 groups during the intervention period, but the Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson indices were higher in the placebo group 1 month after cessation of the intervention. The studied probiotics had minor and transient effects on the microbiota, including increased abundance of 3 of 5 genera during supplementation.

It is hypothesized that probiotics mitigate antibiotic-induced gut microbiota aberrations and consequently decrease antibiotic-related adverse effects such as AAD. However, mechanistic evidence is limited, particularly in children. In this study, we did not observe major effects of antibiotics on diversity indices in either of the groups, in contrast to what was expected and to previous studies in children. This may be due to most of the baseline stool samples being collected after ingestion of 1 or more dose of antibiotics, since it was not feasible or ethical to postpone start of antibiotic therapy until after the first stool sampling. The first antibiotic doses may consequently have already affected the microbiota composition measured in the baseline sample, as supported by the differences in 5 genera between groups at time 1. One may therefore speculate that the alpha diversity at baseline, before starting antibiotic therapy, was in reality higher than measured in our baseline samples. If that indeed was the case, the alpha diversity would first decrease during antibiotic treatment (time 2). Then, in the placebo group, the alpha diversity would increase or return to baseline at time 4, and not in the probiotic group. A 2018 studyconcluded that probiotic supplementation led to slower reconstitution and lower alpha diversity up to 5 months compared with spontaneous recovery, although that study did include a very limited number of participants. A recent meta-analysisalso concluded that probiotic supplementation during antibiotic therapy did not impact diversity indices. However, a more diverse microbiome full of harmful bacteria may be less healthy compared with a less diverse microbiome consisting of healthy bacteria. Which taxa are good or bad bacteria remains an ongoing debate. Therefore, a more diverse microbiome is not necessarily a healthier one, and a lack of overall net change in diversity does not necessarily mean that there are not meaningful changes.

### Comparison of publication of pediatric probiotic vs antibiotic trials registered on clinicalTrials.gov [^3bd7005f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The published evidence in support of probiotic use is conflicting, which may be a result of selective publication of probiotic trials.

Objectives

To compare the proportion of registered trials that evaluate pediatric probiotics vs those that evaluate antibiotics that are published and to identify study-related factors associated with publication status.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study evaluated eligible trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, an online clinical trials registry, from July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2016. Eligible studies included participants younger than 18 years, evaluated a probiotic or 1 of the 5 most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children and adolescents, and randomized study participants. All searches were updated and finalized as of September 9, 2020.

Exposures

Probiotic or antibiotic.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was study publication status. In addition, exposure status (probiotic vs antibiotic), trial result, and funding source were assessed for independent association with publication status. Whether study design elements, publication journal impact factor, and the interval from study completion to publication differed by exposure status were also evaluated.

Results

A total of 401 unique trials (265 probiotic and 136 antibiotic) met eligibility criteria. A greater proportion of antibiotic compared with probiotic studies were published (83 [61.0%] vs 119 [44.9%]; difference, 16.1% [95% CI, 5.8%-25.9%]). After adjustment for funding source, blinding, and purpose, studies evaluating an antibiotic were more likely to be published (odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.4]). No other covariates included in the model were independently associated with publication status. Antibiotic trials, compared with probiotic trials, were more likely to have a therapeutic purpose (114 [83.8%] vs 117 [44.2%]; difference,39.6% [95% CI, 31.1%-48.3%]) and to be multicenter (46 [33.8%] vs 46 [17.4%]; difference,16.5% [95% CI, 7.5%-25.7%]). The median impact factor of the journals in which the studies were published was higher for the antibiotic trials (7.2 [IQR, 2.8-20.5] vs 3.0 [IQR, 2.3-4.2]; P<.001). The median number of days to publication did not differ between the probiotic and antibiotic trials (683 [IQR, 441-1036] vs 801 [IQR, 550-1183]; P=.24).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that probiotic studies are less likely to be published than antibiotic trials. No other study characteristics were associated with publication status. This finding raises concerns regarding the results of meta-analyses of probiotic trials.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^5504c237]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This secondary analysis of an RCT followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committees of the Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, and Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents for children aged 0 to 11 years, children and parents for children aged 12 to 15 years, and children only for those 16 years or older.

Study Design

We conducted a quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled RCT in 3 Dutch and 2 Polish hospitals.The primary aim of the trial was to assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the incidence of AAD, for which results were reported previously.This RCT compared a placebo group with a probiotic supplement group. We obtained fecal samples from children in the RCT to longitudinally describe the effects of a multispecies probiotic on the gastrointestinal tract microbiota composition in children receiving antibiotics. The trial protocol is provided in Supplement 1.

Participants

All children and adolescents aged 3 months to 18 years (hereinafter referred to as children) starting broad-spectrum oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment were eligible for participation. Children were recruited from February 1, 2018, to May 31, 2021. Children were eligible if recruited within 24 hours following initiation of antibiotics. Children were only included in the microbiota analysis if the child or parents collected 2 or more fecal samples and if children were adherent with the study protocol. Children were considered adherent if they received over 75% of the recommended doses of the study product. Exclusion criteria have been described previously.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^f6e59a94]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics are marketed in several countries and widely used by pediatric health care providers. Although probiotics can be helpful for specific disorders, they have been broadly prescribed for disorders without clear evidence to support their use. Furthermore, in certain specific conditions, probiotics cause clinical deterioration. This report is a review and evaluation of the evidence or lack thereof to support a beneficial effect of probiotic agents in a variety of pediatric conditions and to review the safety and potential adverse events that may be encountered when using probiotics. It is also important to emphasize that probiotics are highly heterogeneous with differences in composition, biological activity, and dose among the different probiotic preparations.

### Probiotics as prevention and treatment for diarrhea [^5e086adb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To critically appraise evidence on probiotic use for prevention and treatment of diarrhea in children and adults.

Recent Findings

Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggested that probiotics are effective in primary and secondary prevention of gastroenteritis and its treatment. Selected Lactobacillus strains had a modest, although significant effect in primary prevention. Saccharomyces boulardii was effective in antibiotic-associated and in Clostridium difficile diarrhea. There is evidence that it might prevent diarrhea in day-care centers. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was associated with reduced diarrheal duration and severity, more evident in case of childhood Rotavirus diarrhea. Similar, although weaker, evidence was obtained with S. boulardii. Both strains are included in evidence-based recommendations for gastroenteritis management in children. Data on other Lactobacillus strains are preliminary. Probiotic efficacy was related to cause, early administration and bacterial load, and their mechanisms were associated with antiinfectious action in the intestine or, indirectly, to modulation of innate and adaptive immunity.

Summary

Probiotics have gained a role as adjunctive treatment of infantile gastroenteritis together with rehydration. Their efficacy is less convincing in adults, but promising in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, evidence of efficacy is limited to a few strains.

### Probiotics for the management of pediatric gastrointestinal disorders: position paper of the ESPGHAN special interest group on gut microbiota and modifications [^1da81050]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, prophylactic probiotics, ESPGHAN 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering high doses (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) of Saccharomyces boulardii or Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG started simultaneously with antibiotic treatment to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in outpatients and hospitalized pediatric patients if the use of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea is considered because of the existence of risk factors, such as class of antibiotic, duration of antibiotic treatment, age, need for hospitalization, comorbidities, or previous episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

### Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea [^66003520]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Probiotics are increasingly used for prevention and treatment of diarrhea more in children than in adults. Given the broad spectrum of diarrhea, this review focuses on the main etiologies: acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). For each, we reviewed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines. For acute gastroenteritis we found 12 guidelines: 5 recommended probiotics and 7 did not. However, the guidelines containing positive recommendations provided proof of evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Saccharomyces boulardii had the most compelling evidence of efficacy as they reduced the duration of the disease by 1 day. For AAD 4 meta-analyses were found, reporting variable efficacy of probiotics in preventing diarrhea, based on the setting, patient's age, and antibiotics. The most effective strains were LGG and S. boulardii. For NEC, we found 3 randomized controlled trials, 5 meta-analyses, and 4 position papers. Probiotics reduced the risk of NEC enterocolitis and mortality in preterm babies. Guidelines did not support a routine use of probiotics and asked for further data for such sensitive implications. In conclusion, there is strong and solid proof of efficacy of probiotics as active treatment of gastroenteritis in addition to rehydration. There is solid evidence that probiotics have some efficacy in prevention of AAD, but the number needed to treat is an issue. For both etiologies LGG and S. boulardii have the strongest evidence. In NEC the indications are more debated, yet on the basis of available data and their implications, probiotics should be carefully considered.

Background

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a side-effect frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although a number of clinical studies show that co-administration of specific probiotics reduces the risk for AAD, there is still unclarity among healthcare professionals on the recommendation of probiotic products. This paper aims at a practical guide to inform healthcare professionals, patients and consumers about the exact product characteristics of available probiotics with a proven efficacy to prevent AAD.

Methods

The workflow in this paper includes three consecutive steps: 1) systematic review of relevant clinical studies for effective probiotics by a meta-analysis, 2) compilation of a list of available probiotic products, and 3) recommendation of probiotic products that match effective formulations. Our systematic review on the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD included only studies with randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trials, a clear definition of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and a probiotic administration regime for at least the duration of the antibiotic therapy.

Results

Using our inclusion criteria, we selected 32 out of 128 identified trials and pooled the results of these studies for each specific dairy product and food supplement. The results indicate a total of seven single or multiple-strain formulations favoring the probiotic treatment group, with the strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG being the most effective [relative risk ratio of probiotic versus placebo 0.30 (95% CI 0.16–0.5)]. We selected products for recommendation from a compiled list of all probiotic dairy products and food supplements available in The Netherlands and categorized them into groups of products showing effects against the incidence of AAD in at least one, two or three independent clinical studies. We excluded all products which did not unambiguously declare on the label the specific probiotic strain(s) and the number of colony forming units.

Conclusion

Here we present a practical guide that informs healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^0ae7dece]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of an RCT, the studied probiotics had minor and transient effects on the microbiota compared with placebo, including increased abundance of 3 of 5 supplemented genera during supplementation, which subsequently reverted to baseline levels at 1-month follow-up. Alpha and beta diversity were not different during probiotic supplementation, but both the Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson indices were increased in the placebo group at 1-month follow-up. It therefore remains debated whether probiotics have beneficial effects on antibiotic-induced microbiota composition aberrations. Future studies with adequate baseline samples and homogenous study populations that also focus on the function of the microbiota and the association between the microbiota and clinical outcomes are needed to assess whether observed transient effects on taxonomic composition and effects on diversity have a mechanistic role in protection against antibiotic-induced adverse effects, including AAD.

### Recommendations for probiotic use – 2008 [^f7ea5450]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics were published after a Yale University Workshop in 2005. A similar workshop was held in 2007, and the recommendations were updated and extended into other areas. The recommendations are graded into an "A," "B," "C" or no category based on the expert's opinion and review by the workshop participants. An "A" recommendation is made for acute childhood diarrhea, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, and in an immune response for the treatment and prevention of atopic eczema associated with cow's milk allergy. The group maintained several "B" recommendations in other areas of treating inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Although there are significant studies in the "B" group, most "B" recommendations did not reach an "A" level because of some negative studies or a limited number of studies. Many reports in the "C" recommendations were significant but fell short of receiving stronger ratings because of the size of reported patient studies, and also the factors that limited categories to the "B" rating.

### Probiotics for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^eb0e7349]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs in approximately 25% of patients receiving antibiotics. Hospitalized patients with AAD are at increased risk for nosocomial infections and have a higher mortality. Probiotics are living microorganisms used to restore gut health by changing the intestinal microbiota. Several have been studied for the prevention of AAD. Five meta-analyses of trials of probiotics for the prevention of AAD have been performed. The results showed an overall reduction in the risk of AAD when probiotics were coadministered with antibiotics. McFarland conducted the largest meta-analysis to date analyzing 25 randomized controlled trials of probiotics for the prevention of AAD including 2810 subjects. More than half of the trials demonstrated efficacy of the probiotic. In particular, Lactobacillus GG, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the probiotic mixtures were effective. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published a review of the literature on the use of probiotics for the prevention of pediatric AAD, including 10 randomized trials testing 1986 children. The per protocol pooled analysis, but not the intent-to-treat analysis, showed that probiotics are effective for preventing AAD with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of diarrhea being 10. Lactobacillus GG, Bacillus coagulans, and S. boulardii appeared to be most effective. Probiotics are generally safe, however, they should be used with caution in patients who have compromise of either the immune system or the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, and in the presence of a central venous catheter.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^480ed5f4]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Implication for practice and research

The summary of the available literature facilitates the utilization of scientific results in daily practice, which is crucially important. According to our findings, probiotics have only a minimal and temporary effect on the composition and diversity of gut microbiome during antibiotic therapy and are not suitable for preventing antibiotic-induced low-diversity dysbiosis. In this regard, strain-specific probiotic supplementation with antibiotics may be considered especially for vulnerable groups to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as advised by the current guideline of the AGA and WGO on the use of probiotics. These findings were however not connected to gut microbial compositions. Given our results, which describe a low moderating effect on gut flora, the question arises as to what exactly is the mechanism by which probiotics help prevent these conditions. A recent meta-analysis also points out that some strains may be more effective in the prevention of diarrhea and that the effect depends on the initial risk level. According to this, patients with a low baseline diarrhea risk do not benefit from probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment. Our findings do not suggest any further benefit regarding microbiome composition. Further evaluation of the relation between clinical manifestations, microbial diversity indices, and taxonomic composition will bring a more comprehensive understanding of the role of gut microbes in human health and how different factors affect it. The standardization of methods for microbiome diversity measurement and the definition of its optimal value are key factors in generating more homogenous data with increased clinical relevance. A measurement after a standard follow-up period should be considered for all future similar studies to determine the long-term effects.

### Therapeutic eradication choices ininfection in children [^f60e8c67]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

H. pylori, the most common infection of childhood, remains a vital pathogen that results in life-threatening complications during adulthood if left untreated. In all patients, but particularly in children, it is important to improve the success rate of first-line treatment due to the limited number of antibiotics that are appropriate to use for rescue therapy. In addition, the empiric use of CLA and MET may promote further increases in H. pylori antimicrobial resistance and further, the therapeutic regimens may induce intestinal dysbiosis with potential digestive and metabolism disorders.

For these reasons, the best strategy for eradicating H. pylori infection in children remains the tailored therapy based on antimicrobial susceptibility test. Alternatively, empirical treatment according to either local susceptibility or personal antibiotic history is acceptable.

Maybe HDDT or vonoprazan-AMO dual therapy may represent the most promising therapeutic choice. Although adding selective probiotics to eradication treatment seems ameliorate both the successful rate and poly-antibiotic-related side effects, the efficacy of probiotics in improving the eradication rate of H. pylori infection remains controversial both in adults and children therefore, they are not still recommended in clinical practice because of the low certainty of evidence of the studies.

### An update on the use and investigation of probiotics in health and disease [^f7d7e7ff]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Infectious diarrhoea

Enteric and diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under the age of 5 worldwide, with low- and middle-income countries bearing the brunt of this burden.Repeated infections lead to acute and chronic undernutrition, resulting in more frequent and more severe infections; eventually this leads to developmental deficits in growth, fitness and cognition, which persist into adulthood with devastating human and economic consequences globally. – A better understanding of the intestinal microbiota and of potential action mechanisms of probiotics has led to studies evaluating their efficacy in acute infectious gastroenteritisand in the setting of persistent diarrhoea.Such approaches have the potential to help reduce the global burden of childhood disease.Treatment of acute diarrhoea with probiotics appears to reduce diarrhoea duration by about 1 day (predominantly in developed areas; 22 studies carried out in developing areas were more variable).In persistent diarrhoea in developing areas, an approximate 4-day reduction in the duration of persistent diarrhoea, coupled with improved growth parameters, has been noted.

Several studies with probiotics, including Saccharomyces boulardi, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and other strains report reductions in nosocomial diarrhoea rates, as well as reductions in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and recurrences of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea.These effects include a 40–60% reduction in the frequency of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, but studies documenting a reduction in C difficile -associated diarrhoea are far fewer and remain the subject of controversy. – Indeed, Floch et al considered evidence insufficient for an ‘A’ recommendation for this indication.

Nosocomial infections remain a major healthcare concern, with estimated yearly direct medical costs in the USA of US $28–45 billion,pointing to the need for a preventive approach. However, the results of studies evaluating the preventive effect of probiotics on nosocomial infections have been mixed. Some show benefit,whereas others do not. – Three RCTs (including 1043 children) tested L rhamnosus GG supplementation and showed significantly reduced rates of nosocomial rotavirus diarrhoea. – Supplementing infant formula with B bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus reduced the frequency of episodes of acute infectious diarrhoea. L rhamnosus GG was effective in reducing nosocomial gastrointestinal and respiratory tract illnesses in over 2000 immunocompetent children ≥1 year of age without underlying illnesses who were suddenly hospitalised for reasons unrelated to gastrointestinal or respiratory tract problems.Although probiotics show promise in reducing nosocomial infections among some populations, they are not recommended for critically ill hospitalised patients at this time.

Discussion

Study selection and inclusion criteria

In this review we chose to only include studies that had a clear definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, to be able to compare their results in a systematic way. However, studies lacking a precise definition of diarrhea may still provide valuable information, and it could be a subject for future discussions how to interpret them and whether to take them into account when formulating recommendations. Furthermore, the strict definition of diarrhea used in some studies means that the protective effect of probiotics against AAD may have been underestimated. Given the scope of the review, we searched for clinical trials involving the use of antibiotics, but we didn’t apply strict inclusion criteria regarding the kind of antibiotic used. We didn’t look for studies using specific treatments, nor did we exclude studies that did not indicate which antibiotics they used, since diarrhea can be a side-effect of many. Five of the studies that we included did not specify which antibiotic was administered to the patients during the clinical trial. Of the remaining 27 studies, 21 enrolled patients taking different antibiotics, including antibiotic such as broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins associated with a high-risk of AAD.

Only some studies reported which antibiotics were used among the characteristic of patients following treatment. Kotowska et al. suggested that the probiotic they tested (Saccharomyces boulardii) may be effective in preventing diarrhea caused by amoxicillin with clavulanate and by intravenous ceforuxime, but they also mentioned that they could not make definitive conclusions regarding differences in the probiotic’s efficacy against different classes of antibiotics. Similarly, other studies could not detect significant differences in this regard, either because of a small sample size (relative to the number of antibiotics tested) or because of the low incidence of diarrhea in the study, or both. Twenty-two of the studies included in this review included a power analysis. Of these, 11 detected a significant difference between treatment and placebo, including two studies that were underpowered according to their power analysis. Of the 11 studies that did not detect a significant difference between the treatment and the placebo, four were underpowered [–,]. By ensuring that clinical trials have enough power it would be possible to identify which probiotics are most effective in preventing diarrhea caused by specific antibiotics, and clinicians would be able to recommend different probiotic products based on the antibiotic therapy prescribed to their patients.

### Probiotics for gastrointestinal conditions: a summary of the evidence [^de5fe95b]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Probiotics contain microorganisms, most of which are bacteria similar to the beneficial bacteria that occur naturally in the human gut. Probiotics have been widely studied in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases. The most-studied species include Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces. However, a lack of clear guidelines on when to use probiotics and the most effective probiotic for different gastrointestinal conditions may be confusing for family physicians and their patients. Probiotics have an important role in the maintenance of immunologic equilibrium in the gastrointestinal tract through the direct interaction with immune cells. Probiotic effectiveness can be species-, dose-, and disease-specific, and the duration of therapy depends on the clinical indication. There is high-quality evidence that probiotics are effective for acute infectious diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Conversely, there is evidence that probiotics are not effective for acute pancreatitis and Crohn disease. Probiotics are safe for infants, children, adults, and older patients, but caution is advised in immunologically vulnerable populations.

### Efficacy and safety of BB-12 supplemented strawberry yogurt for healthy children on antibiotics (PLAY ON) [^3ef65c9e]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, many probiotic products used for AAD are not supported by rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. The overarching objective is to move research forward for the most well-studied Bifidobacterium strain. Objectives: The primary aim is to test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Other aims are to further assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12, and to carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics. The microbiota includes hundreds of species, and its disruption is hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD. AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12. This is a Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12. Hypotheses 3: Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut microbiota in pediatric patients, and concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic-induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling. Study Design and Analysis: We will finish in the June 2023 a Phase II, randomized, doubleblinded controlled trial with allocation concealment. Setting: Capital Areal Primary Care Practice Based Research Network. Population Studied: 270 patients, ages 3-12 years, clinically diagnosed with a respiratory infection requiring 7-10 days of antibiotics. Interventions: The two arms are, BB-12-supplemented yogurt and non-supplemented control yogurt, in a 1:1 randomized allocation. Participants of all ages will be asked to consume the same dose, 100 ml, of product per day. The 100 ml serving of probiotic yogurt will deliver ≥1010 CFU of BB-12. The BB-12 probiotic was not be added.

### Probiotics for pediatric diarrhea and constipation: an umbrella meta-analysis [^51bc5dae]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This umbrella review supports the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and managing diarrhea in children, particularly in cases of acute infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. There is also some evidence suggesting modest benefits for constipation, indicating potential utility in managing functional bowel disorders; however, findings related to stool frequency remain inconclusive. Future research should prioritize rigorously designed randomized controlled trials that utilize standardized probiotic strains, report consistent core outcomes, and adequately control for confounding factors. Developing strain-specific clinical guidelines may enhance probiotics’ precision and therapeutic impact in pediatric gastrointestinal care.

### Comparison of publication of pediatric probiotic vs antibiotic trials registered on clinicalTrials.gov [^52e6b867]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Although we determined that pediatric probiotic studies are less likely to be published compared with pediatric antibiotic studies, our results do not pinpoint the underlying explanation. Although others have demonstrated a bias toward the publication of beneficial results using the US Food and Drug Administration registry and results database,no such data are available for probiotic studies, which are rarely conducted with the intention of applying for marketing approval or a labeling change.Thus, it is possible that the unpublished probiotic studies represent negative trials and that the higher level of selective publication in this field renders the results of meta-analyses unreliable.

Selective publication is possible in all fields of research, and this can lead to inaccurate estimates of the effectiveness of an intervention.Selective publication wastes limited resources and the contributions of study participants and hinders the advance of medical knowledge. By altering the assessment of efficacy, selective publication can lead to inappropriate medication use and recommendations. Attempts to study selective publication are hindered by the unavailability of data from unpublished trials.Although a variety of tests are available to detect selective reporting bias, none reliably detect or exclude the possibility of bias.,,

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of our study include the large number of registered trials included for analysis that provide adequate power for our analyses. We designed our study to provide a large interval between study registration and assessment of publication status to provide sufficient time for studies to be completed and published. Our protocol for determining publication status and high interobserver reliability ensure confidence in labeling studies as unpublished. Our study is unique in that it compares selective publication across types of medications. This approach enables us to conclude that publication bias may be a greater concern in probiotic studies compared with those evaluating antibiotics in children.

A limitation of our study is the inability to determine the direction of results of trials that were unpublished and unavailable in ClinicalTrials.gov. Although the inclusion of conference abstracts in systematic reviews is a controversial topic,we did not include conference abstract publication in the definition of our primary outcome, which was focused on peer-reviewed journal publication indexed in PubMed or Google Scholar. We only used 1 comparison group—pediatric antibiotic trials—and ideally, subsequent analyses will include comparisons with other drug classes to enable similar comparative analyses to place this concern in the proper context. We also cannot conclusively determine the reason for nonpublication.

### Probiotics in children [^f0829d15]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal flora plays a complex and important role in the development of healthy immunologic and digestive function in children. Probiotics are safe in healthy children and effective in reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the duration of acute infectious diarrhea. Probiotics may also be effective in preventing community-acquired diarrheal infections, in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants, and in the prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The exact strain or combination of strains most effective for common clinical indications has yet to be determined, but the exact strain used seems less important than whether an adequate dose is used (typically 5 to 10 billion CFUs per day or higher). Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the products available because there is a wide range in their quality.

Results

We identified 466 unique probiotic and 209 unique antibiotic trials in ClinicalTrials.gov. After screening, 265 (56.9%) probiotic and 136 (65.1%) antibiotic records were retained for a total of 401 studies (Figure 1). Fifty-eight probiotic trials reported their status as withdrawn, terminated, or unknown compared with 18 antibiotic trials (21.9% vs 13.2%; difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-15.8%]). Probiotic trials were of shorter duration (median, 537 [IQR, 306-973] days) compared with antibiotic trials (median, 1096 [IQR, 668-1642] days; P =.001). Probiotic trials were more likely to be placebo-controlled compared with antibiotic trials (205 [77.4%] vs 55 [40.4%]; difference, 36.9% [95% CI, 26.9%-46.1%]), whereas antibiotic trials were more likely to use a separate intervention (38 [27.9%] vs 18 [6.8%]; difference, 21.2% [95% CI, 13.4%-30.0%]) or dosing regimen (24 [17.6%] vs 3 [1.1%]; difference, 16.5% [95% CI, 10.6%-23.8%]) as comparison groups. Results were more commonly available in ClinicalTrials.gov for the antibiotic studies (39 [28.7%] vs 17 [6.4%]; difference, 22.3% [95% CI, 14.4%-30.7%]) (Table 1).

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^4d00e491]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We also explored the dose effect of probiotics in our meta-analysis. Our results showed that high-dose probiotics (≥10 10 CFU/d) were statistically less effective than low-dose probiotics (P =0.05<0.10). However, a previous meta-analysis conducted by Johnston et al (involving adults and children) demonstrated that higher dosage (>10 10 CFU/d) had a more effective trend than lower dosage but not significantly (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23-0.49 vs. RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.08-4.60; P =0.57>0.10).This may be because we excluded children and the difference in sample size between subgroups. Hence, more RCTs on dose-response were needed to determine whether probiotics in higher doses were more effective and safe.

Our results are almost consistent with the previous meta-analysis in terms of the duration and starting time of probiotics.It is beneficial to use probiotics as early as possible to maintain the gut flora’s stability and prevent the overgrowth of pathogens. Concerning the optimal duration of probiotics, we suggested that probiotics use during antibiotic therapy can effectively prevent AAD. However, whether it is necessary to prolong the use of probiotics after the end of antibiotic treatment still needs more clinical evidence and theoretical support.

Twelve studies applied Lactobacillus as intervention indicated a more protective trend among all the probiotics species (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91). Among them, L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) is the most studied. A meta-analysis proposed that LGG significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.83).This effect may be related to the colonization of LGG in the intestine. It not only enhances the survival rate of the intestinal epithelium survival and preserves cytoskeletal integrity, but also secretes lectin-like proteins 1 and 2 to resist biofilms produced by various pathogens.Unfortunately, because of the insufficient sample size, some probiotics strains cannot be analyzed separately. In addition, we did not find significant differences in the efficacy of single species and multiple species (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.93 vs. RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49-0.76; P =0.86>0.1).

Recommendations

Based on the effectiveness of probiotic strains included in this review in preventing AAD and on the number of studies supporting it, we defined three categories of recommendations. The categories include (i) a three-star recommendation for significant effects for the reduction of AAD shown in at least three of our selected studies, (ii) a two-star recommendation for effects shown in at least two of our selected studies, and (iii) a one-star recommendation for an effect shown in only one study, a trend supported by two or more studies, or the presence of a strain that satisfies one of the above criteria (showing an effect in one study or a trend in at least 2 studies) in sufficient amounts in food supplement or dairy product with a mixed formulation. We screened the list of products available in the Netherlands and selected products that satisfied the criteria above and that contained the relevant strain(s) at a daily dose at least equal to the lowest dose showing an effect in the included studies. For dairy products, we only recommended those that had been specifically included in a clinical trial.

Introduction

Probiotics represent a rapidly growing commercial industry valued at approximately US $15 billion in 2013.With growth estimated to be 7% per annum,there has been a concerted effort to document clinical effectiveness,, through the conduct of randomized clinical trials that are summarized in numerous meta-analyses.,,, The latter inform guideline recommendations,, which often support probiotic use with the caveat that the evidence is weak owing to the inclusion of studies with a high risk of bias. Although many early studies that influence the conclusions of meta-analyses reported benefits associated with probiotic use, recent multicenter trials often contradict these results,,,,, and they are beginning to inform the conclusions of reviews. For example, the 2010 Cochrane review of probiotic use in acute infectious diarrhea (63 studies) concluded that probiotics “have clear beneficial effects in shortening the duration and reducing stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhoea.” (p2) However, the 2020 update (82 studies) states that “probiotics probably make little or no difference to the number of people who have diarrhoea lasting 48 hours or longer, and we are uncertain whether probiotics reduce the duration of diarrhoea.” (p2)

Publication bias occurs when the direction or strength of a finding influences the likelihood, timing, language, and journal of publication.This phenomenon may explain the discordant conclusions of probiotic meta-analyses and the results of recent large, multicenter clinical trials.Because 25% to 50% of registered trials remain unpublished after study completion, meta-analyses may reach incorrect conclusions if the included data misrepresent the effects, benefits, and risks of the intervention. Publication bias is a particular concern in fields where industry-funded studies are common because they are associated with study discontinuation, nonpublication, and more favorable reporting of results and conclusions.

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has embraced the use of registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, and since 2005 have required trial registration before participant enrollment as a prerequisite for publication.We therefore used this data source to compare the proportion of registered trials that are published between those evaluating a probiotic relative to those evaluating an antibiotic. Our secondary objective was to determine whether exposure status (ie, probiotic or antibiotic), trial result, or funding source were independently associated with publication status and whether study design elements, journal impact factor, and interval from study completion to publication differed by exposure status. We hypothesized that a lower proportion of registered probiotic trials are published compared with antibiotic trials.

### Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea [^91d59061]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomized controlled trials reporting the effects of probiotic(s) on acute infectious diarrhoea. To maximize the use of available data, we included participants of all ages and non‐blinded (open) studies; however, to keep results as robust as possible, we did not include quasi‐randomized and unpublished studies. We also did not include studies of probiotics in acute diarrhoea that did not report clinical outcomes (e.g. effect on rotavirus shedding in stools).

Types of participants

Adults and children with acute diarrhoea (duration < 14 days) that was proven or presumed to be caused by an infectious agent. To maximize the relevance of our findings for clinical practice, we included studies in which participants with acute diarrhoea had received antibiotics.

We excluded studies on diarrhoea known or thought to have other causes (e.g. studies on antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea, studies of persistent diarrhoea).

Types of interventions

Interventions

Specific probiotic preparations (single strains and combinations of organisms).

Excluded was yogurt or other fermented foods in which specific probiotic organisms were not identified and killed probiotics.

Control

Placebo or no probiotic.

Intervention and control arms to be otherwise treated identically in relation to other treatments and drugs including zinc.

Types of outcome measures

In view of recent expert recommendations for a core outcome measurement set for acute diarrhoea in children (Karas 2016), we revised our outcomes to include the number of people hospitalized in community studies and the duration of hospitalization in inpatient studies as secondary outcomes. The Expert Panel also recommended degree of dehydration as an outcome measure. However, we did not include this outcome as it was rarely reported in trials included in our previous review (Allen 2010). We included diarrhoea lasting 14 days or longer to examine the proportion of patients progressing to persistent diarrhoea (Walker‐Smith 1993). We included studies that reported one or more of the following primary or secondary outcomes.

Primary outcomes

Diarrhoea lasting ≥ 48 hours
Duration of diarrhoea

Secondary outcomes

Numbers of people hospitalized in community studies
Duration of hospitalization in inpatient studies
Diarrhoea lasting ≥ 14 days

Adverse events

Incidence of adverse events (serious and non‐serious)

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^0dbd1e53]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The efficacy of probiotics in preventing AAD also depends on the dose. A daily intake of at least 5 × 10 9 CFU is associated with significant efficacy for AAD, and it has been shown that higher probiotic dose is linked to greater efficacy. Although only few dose-effect studies have been performed, they observe a positive correlation between dose and AAD risk.

Since so many factors can affect the efficacy of probiotics in prophylaxis, researchers should be rigorous in setting up clinical trials and in providing as much information as possible about them. Studies should report characteristics of the probiotic (strain, dose and duration of therapy), of the antibiotic (type of antibiotic, duration of the therapy) of the patients (age group, diagnosis) and accurate definitions of measured outcomes and adverse effects. In this way, results from different trials can be assessed, compared and used as a basis to formulate recommendations. Individual factors, that are not routinely monitored in clinical trials, may influence the incidence and gravity of side effects and the efficacy of probiotics. For example, each individual has their own unique microbiota, and the impact of a given antibiotic on the composition and stability of different microbial ecosystems can be different; therefore, a specific probiotic strain or combination of strains may not have the same efficacy for every person. Especially for some patients, for example those who are frequently treated with antibiotics such as elderly in care facilities, it is certainly worth being flexible and trying different probiotics until the most effective one has been found. Future research can guide the formulation of personalized therapies.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ef313624]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Probiotic supplementation seems to maintain the level of Bifidobacteria during antibiotic therapy. Several species and/or strains of this genus may be useful for health, including modulating gut microbial homeostasis, inhibiting pathogens, and modulating immune responses. They can suppress the oncogenic activity within the microbiome, and they are able to produce vitamins and transform food compounds into bioactive molecules. Bifidobacteria also play a crucial role during early life. They are among the first colonizers of the human gut. According to previous studies, children with allergic diseases have a reduced gut microbial diversity with lower abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides compared to healthy controls. Therefore, the results of Zhong et al. are especially important as they showed that probiotic supplementation was able to maintain the level of Bifidobacteria in newborns during antibiotic therapy.

Some of the included articles suggested that probiotic supplementation during antibiotic therapy has a protective effect on Blautia and Roseburia spp. levels. Recently, Blautia has been associated with the alleviation of inflammatory and metabolic diseases by regulating host health, and it has also been characterized by antibacterial activity. Gut Roseburia spp. produce short-chain fatty acids, modulate colonic motility, support immunity, and have anti-inflammatory effects. These findings suggest that probiotic supplementation may have some benefits but the tendency for Blautia levels to normalize spontaneously after antibiotic discontinuation casts doubt on them.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^fd38fe1d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Another placebo-controlled trial in antibiotic-exposed adults (n = 136), supplementing the intervention arm with L paracasei CNCM I-1518 and L rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 for 28 days, including the 14-day antibiotic treatment,also showed that probiotic supplementation resulted in increased abundance of the supplemented probiotics, in line with our results. However, the investigators found a reduced degree of antibiotic-induced aberrations and earlier restoration within 28 days after antibiotic cessation,which was not clearly observed in our study.

Several other studies, of the effects of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota during antibiotic treatment have shown conflicting results regarding diversity indices, microbiota composition, and recovery time. However, these previous studies included different study populations, including adults or neonates; other types, doses, and durations of probiotics and antibiotics; and stool samples collected at different times and analyzed by different methods.These differences limit the possibility of reliably comparing results of these studies with our data.

### Comparison of publication of pediatric probiotic vs antibiotic trials registered on clinicalTrials.gov [^1a09e39a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that registered pediatric probiotic trials are less likely to be published than registered pediatric antibiotic studies. Although further research is needed to establish the underlying study characteristics that explain this finding, our results raise a concern regarding the accuracy of meta-analyses that rely on published data to reach their conclusions. These results serve to highlight the importance of closing the loopholes and barriers that allow studies to be conducted without publishing their findings. This evidence should drive regulatory measures to ensure access to unpublished trial data and the provision of reasons for nonpublication.

### Multispecies probiotic for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children: a randomized clinical trial [^c61be6e4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The efficacy of multispecies probiotic formulations in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the effect of a multispecies probiotic on the risk of AAD in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from February 2018 to May 2021 in a multicenter, mixed setting (inpatients and outpatients). Patients were followed up throughout the intervention period. Eligibility criteria included age 3 months to 18 years, recruitment within 24 hours following initiation of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, and signed informed consent. In total, 646 eligible patients were approached and 350 patients took part in the trial.

Interventions

A multispecies probiotic consisting of Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, for a total dose of 10 billion colony-forming units daily, for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was AAD, defined as 3 or more loose or watery stools per day in a 24-hour period, caused either by Clostridioides difficile or of otherwise unexplained etiology, after testing for common diarrheal pathogens. The secondary outcomes included diarrhea regardless of the etiology, diarrhea duration, and predefined diarrhea complications.

Results

A total of 350 children (192 boys and 158 girls; mean [range] age, 50 [3-212] months) were randomized and 313 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Compared with placebo (n=155), the probiotic (n=158) had no effect on risk of AAD (relative risk [RR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.49-1.33). However, children in the probiotic group had a lower risk of diarrhea regardless of the etiology (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94). No differences were observed between the groups for most of the secondary outcomes, including adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

A multispecies probiotic did not reduce the risk of AAD in children when analyzed according to the most stringent definition. However, it reduced the overall risk of diarrhea during and for 7 days after antibiotic treatment. Our study also shows that the AAD definition has a significant effect on clinical trial results and their interpretation.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03334604.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^027020d6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study include the randomized, placebo-controlled design of the study, which allowed us to compare probiotic-exposed participants with controls, and standardized collection of a relatively large number of samples. Additionally, this study is one of the first, to our knowledge, to focus on the longitudinal effects of a multispecies probiotic in antibiotic-exposed children.

This study also has several limitations. Due to the limited number of children with diarrhea, we were unable to investigate differences in the microbiota between children with diarrhea (nonresponders) and children without diarrhea (responders). Additionally, as reported previously, the baseline sample may have been affected by antibiotics, as it was collected after the first antibiotic dose in most cases. It was impossible and unethical to postpone antibiotic initiation until collection of the first fecal sample. The infection for which antibiotics were prescribed may have affected the gut microbiota composition, especially in those cases with a gastrointestinal tract infection. Furthermore, not all children recruited in the initial trial focusing on AAD incidence were included in this part of the study, as not all participants collected at least 2 stool samples and were adherent to the study protocol. This led to a loss of power to study the microbiota as an outcome. Regardless, this remains the largest study to investigate the effect of probiotics on the microbiota in children receiving antibiotics. The high number of dropouts may have introduced confounding, and although this study was an RCT, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out. In the present study, most participants were recruited from Dutch centers, whereas most participants in the original trial were recruited in Poland. Differences in antibiotic treatment indication and duration and national guidelines has led to differences in participants who were included in the original trial and participants who dropped out. There was a broad age range of children included in our study, and different types of antibiotics were prescribed for different indications, potentially affecting the results. Other variables impacting the microbiota that were not measured in this study, such as diet, may have biased the results. Only 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to study the microbiota composition; metabolomics analysis will be performed on collected samples in the future, allowing insight into microbial function rather than only composition.

### Who uses probiotics and why? A survey study conducted among general gastroenterology patients [^6b18a373]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This was an endoscopy suite-based survey study of general gastroenterology patients with a 90% response rate. We found that almost one third of patients had used probiotics recently. Bloating was more closely associated with use of probiotics than diarrhoea. To our surprise, probiotics users had similar demographics compared with non-users (age, sex, race/ethnicity and income). Rather, the most marked differences between probiotics users and non-users were related to beliefs. Users of probiotics reported beliefs that probiotics benefit overall health, gastrointestinal health, longevity, maintenance of a healthy weight and benefits for the microbiome.

Medical professionals are a trusted source of information and understanding the patient’s knowledge base is crucial for an effective patient–physician relationship.The results of this study make it clear that a significant portion of the gastroenterology patient population uses probiotics to some degree, and that the most common reason for doing so is belief in general health benefits as opposed to belief in specific gastrointestinal health benefits. Interestingly, patients were equally likely to use probiotics for diarrhoea as they were for constipation. An understanding of patient expectations will allow practitioners to better prepare for comprehensive discussions about the therapeutic use of probiotics. Clinicians can use this knowledge to hone their questions when discussing probiotics or alternative and complementary therapies with their patients.

As use of probiotics has become more common, the literature regarding effect has become more robust. Most prior studies of probiotics studies test the effectiveness of certain probiotic strains in treating various gastrointestinal conditions. Results of these studies are conflicting, likely due to the varying stool collection methodology, clinical endpoints and the large number of individually studied probiotic strains which are often formulated in combinations.A 2021 guideline from the AGA found evidence supporting the health benefits of probiotics in four specific instances: prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection among those taking antibiotics, pouchitis, acute gastroenteritis in children and for preterm infants.Even in these targeted situations, the AGA’s recommendations for probiotics were conditional and based on relatively few rigorous studies. Meanwhile, the preclinical literature related to probiotics suggests the possibility of benefit for conditions ranging from colon cancerto diabetesand is expanding rapidly. In this survey, users of probiotics indicated that they were more likely to take probiotics for general reasons (longevity, health/well-being) rather than for specific diseases or symptoms. Probiotics users may be excited by the potential of probiotics, perceive few downsides, and less attuned to evidence than medical professionals.

### Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^13f3cdea]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Probiotics are live microorganisms intended to confer a health benefit when consumed. One condition for which probiotics have been advocated is the diarrhea that is a common adverse effect of antibiotic use.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for probiotic use in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).

Data Sources

Twelve electronic databases were searched (DARE, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, MANTIS, TOXLINE, ToxFILE, NTIS, and AGRICOLA) and references of included studies and reviews were screened from database inception to February 2012, without language restriction.

Study Selection

Two independent reviewers identified parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and/or Bacillus) for the prevention or treatment of AAD.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed trial quality.

Results

A total of 82 RCTs met inclusion criteria. The majority used Lactobacillus-based interventions alone or in combination with other genera; strains were poorly documented. The pooled relative risk in a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis of 63 RCTs, which included 11 811 participants, indicated a statistically significant association of probiotic administration with reduction in AAD (relative risk, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.68; P < .001; I(2), 54%; [risk difference, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.05], [number needed to treat, 13; 95% CI, 10.3 to 19.1]) in trials reporting on the number of patients with AAD. This result was relatively insensitive to numerous subgroup analyses. However, there exists significant heterogeneity in pooled results and the evidence is insufficient to determine whether this association varies systematically by population, antibiotic characteristic, or probiotic preparation.

Conclusions

The pooled evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a reduction in AAD. More research is needed to determine which probiotics are associated with the greatest efficacy and for which patients receiving which specific antibiotics.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^9e1d5a0c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children—this clinical report reviews and evaluates the evidence or lack thereof for beneficial effects of probiotic agents in pediatric conditions and examines safety and potential adverse events, noting that probiotics are highly heterogeneous and that in certain specific conditions probiotics cause clinical deterioration. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host, and in vitro studies suggest they act through several different mechanisms and can modulate the immune system. A variety of probiotic agents have been studied as single agents or combinations, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, saccharomyces, Escherichia coli and streptococci, but considerable differences exist among preparations, most studies have not been reproduced or confirmed, and in vitro effects may display opposite behavior in vivo. The authors state that understanding of use for children is just beginning and that considerably more supporting evidence is required; PubMed and MEDLINE searches were performed for all human trial studies related to probiotic therapy.

### Efficacy of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhoea: a meta-analysis of masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials [^bd12e205]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the evidence for the use of probiotics in the prevention of acute diarrhoea, we did a meta-analysis of the available data from 34 masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Only one trial was community based and carried out in a developing country. Most of the remaining 33 studies were carried out in a developed country in a health-care setting. Evaluating the evidence by types of acute diarrhoea suggests that probiotics significantly reduced antibiotic-associated diarrhoea by 52% (95% CI 35-65%), reduced the risk of travellers' diarrhoea by 8% (-6 to 21%), and that of acute diarrhoea of diverse causes by 34% (8-53%). Probiotics reduced the associated risk of acute diarrhoea among children by 57% (35-71%), and by 26% (7-49%) among adults. The protective effect did not vary significantly among the probiotic strains Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and other strains used alone or in combinations of two or more strains. Although there is some suggestion that probiotics may be efficacious in preventing acute diarrhoea, there is a lack of data from community-based trials and from developing countries evaluating the effect on acute diarrhoea unrelated to antibiotic usage. The effect on acute diarrhoea is dependent on the age of the host and genera of strain used.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile diarrhea [^4b886d2c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is a common clinical problem occurring in up to 25% of patients, with diarrhea owing to Clostridium difficile accounting for up to a quarter of cases. The clinical and economic costs of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are significant and better treatments are needed. Probiotics may offer potential effective therapy for antibiotic-associated diarrhea by restoring intestinal microbial balance. A number of different probiotics have been evaluated in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, including the nonpathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii and multiple lactic-acid fermenting bacteria such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). A careful review of the literature supports the efficacy of S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea recurrent C. difficile infection in adults, whereas LGG is useful in the treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. Not enough data exist to currently support the use of other probiotic preparations in these conditions. Although generally safe and well tolerated, both S. boulardii and LGG should be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients. Further study of probiotics, including large, well-designed, randomized controlled dose-ranging trials, comparative trials, and cost-benefit analyses are necessary.

### The effect of probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic supplements on anthropometric measures and respiratory infections in malnourished children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b108e400]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Various nutrients play a role in preventing the occurrence of chronic diseases and complications caused by malnutrition. Probiotics, increasingly utilized for weight gain, exhibit beneficial effects on the absorption of both micronutrients and macronutrients. Widespread probiotic use has been shown to promote weight gain through the modulation of gut microbiota. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may be beneficial to the host. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most common species used in probiotics. They function by modulating the immune system, preventing pathogens from adhering to the intestinal lining, and enhancing nutrient absorption.

In addition to facilitating weight gain, probiotics provide several other benefits, such as decreasing the incidence of infectious and bloody diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, and necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants. They also help manage irritable bowel syndrome, childhood allergies, anemia, and can influence growth patterns in children. Recent meta-analyses provide evidence that probiotics are effective in shortening the duration of hospitalization for well-nourished children with acute diarrhea. Guidelines have been published recommending their use in treating acute gastroenteritis and in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in both children and adults undergoing antibiotic treatment for any reason.

Prebiotics are oligosaccharides that resist digestion by the host but undergo fermentation by gut microorganisms. These indigestible compounds, fermented by native colonic bacteria, yield beneficial physiological effects for the host. Prebiotics stimulate the activity of native gut bacteria, leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids, lowering the pH of the colon, inhibiting the growth of harmful pathogens, improving immune system function, and enhancing the absorption of minerals and trace elements.

The combination of probiotics and prebiotics is known as synbiotics, which offer a synergistic effect that exceeds the benefits of each component alone. Various studies have highlighted the positive impact of synbiotic supplementation on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), which are key anthropometric indicators of child development.

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes existing evidence on probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and malnutrition, offering valuable insights into their potential as interventions for addressing malnutrition in children. This study aims to address the following research questions:

How do probiotic supplements impact growth indicators and respiratory infections in malnourished children?
How do prebiotic supplements influence growth indicators and respiratory infections in malnourished children?
How do synbiotic supplements affect growth indicators and respiratory infections in malnourished children?

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^862557c9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective:

This meta-analysis aims to combine the latest research evidence to assess the effect of probiotics on preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults.

Methods:

PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials on probiotics preventing AAD. A random or fixed effect model was used to combine the incidence of AAD (primary outcome) and the adverse event rates. The authors performed subgroup analyses to explore the effects of different participants population, probiotics species, and dosage.

Results:

Thirty-six studies were included with 9312 participants. Probiotics reduced the incidence of AAD by 38% (pooled relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.74). The protective effect of probiotics was still significant when grouped by reasons for antibiotics treatment, probiotic duration, probiotic dosage, and time from antibiotic to probiotic. However, there were no statistically significant increased adverse events in the probiotics group (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.14).

Conclusions:

This updated meta-analysis suggested that using probiotics as early as possible during antibiotic therapy has a positive and safe effect on preventing AAD in adults. Further studies should focus on the optimal dosage and duration of probiotics to develop a specific recommendation.

Methods

Search strategy and inclusion criteria

Included in this review are studies that assessed the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in patients treated with antibiotics, regardless of their age, of the intervention setting (hospital or outpatients) and of the indication for which they were prescribed. In order to identify these studies we first screened the references listed by previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and then we directly searched clinical trials in public databases. Database searches were conducted on the 16th of January 2017.

We searched reviews and meta-analyses on the following databases for the period 1960–2016: the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and PubMed. For the DARE and the CDSR databases we searched combinations of the following terms: “probiotic”, “antibiotic”, “diarrhea” and “antibiotic-associated diarrhea”. The search yielded 25 results from the DARE and 50 from the CDSR. In PubMed, we searched for meta-analyses using the following search texts: “((probiotic[Title/Abstract] OR probiotics[Title/Abstract]) AND (antibiotic associated diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotic-associated diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotic associated diarrhoea[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotic-associated diarrhoea[Title/Abstract]))”, which yielded 28 results; and “((diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR diarrhoea[Title/Abstract]) AND (probiotic[Title/Abstract] OR probiotics[Title/Abstract]) AND (antibiotic[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotics[Title/Abstract]))”, which yielded 34 results. After screening of titles and abstracts and exclusion of duplicates and reviews not relevant to our purpose, we identified 28 relevant reviews and meta-analyses [,–], containing a total of 102 relevant studies.

### Perspectives from the society for pediatric research: probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^ed6a84ba]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea

We found 13 studies focused on probiotic interventions for the prevention of AAD. The most common probiotic interventions tested included Saccharomyces boulardii (4 studies), Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (2 studies), and Lactobacillus GG (2 studies). All the studies include children who were prescribed antibiotics in an outpatient setting and usually within 48 h.

The majority of studies focused on single strains of probiotics, the most studied of which is S. boulardii. A study by Kotowska et al. randomized 269 children (246 of whom were analyzed) who were prescribed antibiotics for either acute otitis media or respiratory infections to either probiotic or placebo. They found a lower rates of AAD in the probiotics versus placebo group (3.4 versus 17.3%).Similarly, Jindal et al. randomized 600 children given antibiotics to receive either probiotics and antibiotics or antibiotics alone. They also report a lower rate of AAD in the probiotics group compared to antibiotics alone (5.3 versus 24.0%). Of note, this study did not include a placebo group.A 2013 study by Shan et al. found that patients who received antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections and also received S. boulardii (n = 167) had a lower incidence of AAD than those who were not given probiotics (n = 166), with a relative risk of 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1–0.5). Further, this group also reported that initiation of S. boulardii in children who developed AAD but were not initially randomized to receive probiotics resulted in a decreased stool frequency compared to those in whom probiotics were not initiated. However, the authors in this work included diarrhea due to C. difficile in their AAD group, potentially affecting the interpretation of their results.A final study by Bin et al. found a lower incidence of AAD in children receiving triple antibiotic therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in children who were given S. boulardii (CNCM I-745) with the antibiotics compared to patients who received antibiotics alone (11.8 versus 28.3%, p < 0.05).

### Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^7ce809a4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is common (5-10%) and recurs in 10-30%. UTI causes an unpleasant, usually febrile illness in children. This review focuses on studies evaluating interventions to prevent UTI in children and published between January 2007 and June 2008.

Recent Findings

Three relevant updated Cochrane reviews, six randomized trials and an evidence-based guideline were published in the study period. Five of the six trials and one of the three Cochrane updates included data on the effects of relevant interventions in children. Three of the six trials investigated the efficacy of long-term, low-dose antibiotics as prophylaxis, and the other trials and both Cochrane updates evaluated complementary therapies such as vitamin A, probiotics and herbal supplements.

Summary

The benefit of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in children remains unclear because of underpowered and suboptimally designed trials, but these studies suggest that any benefit is likely to be small, and clinical significance may be limited. The trials of complementary interventions (vitamin A, probiotics, cranberry, nasturtium and horseradish) generally gave favourable results but were not conclusive.

### Probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in... [^c7294b2e]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Narrative: Antibiotics often disrupt the natural balance of nonpathogenic bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract. 1 This action can permit pathogenic bacteria to uncontrollably reproduce; interfere with mineral and vitamin metabolism; compromise mucosal integrity within the intestines; and lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea. 2 In children, stool frequency associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be challenging to quantify, and significantly varies between infants and older children. Probiotics are supplements that contain nonpathogenic species of bacteria or yeast that reinforce the epithelial, mucosal, intestinal, and systemic immune regulatory activities of the gastrointestinal tract. 8, 9 Studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in otherwise healthy children.

The Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group evaluated the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with probiotic use in children. The most beneficial strains and doses of probiotics were sought by identifying 33 randomized, parallel, controlled trials including 6, 352 participants. 11 These trials compared probiotics with placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment. The primary end points of the studies included determining the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the number and type of adverse events. The secondary end points of the trials identified the most beneficial probiotic strains and doses, mean duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and microbiome characteristics. The heterogeneity of these trials was moderate. Patients who did not complete the studies were excluded from the analysis. Twenty-four studies encompassing 4, 415 participants reported no serious adverse reactions. Nonsevere adverse effects were experienced by 4% of patients receiving probiotics, which was statistically insignificant. High-dose probiotics were found to be superior in reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea compared with low-dose probiotics. Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus in dosages of 5 to 40 billion CFUs per day were the most beneficial. Findings from eight trials suggested that probiotics may moderately reduce the mean duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by nearly one day. Low-quality, inconclusive data regarding microbiome characteristics were inconsistent with selective reporting and were not clinically useful.

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^cad75c56]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This meta-analysis aims to combine the latest research evidence to assess the effect of probiotics on preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials on probiotics preventing AAD. A random or fixed effect model was used to combine the incidence of AAD (primary outcome) and the adverse event rates. The authors performed subgroup analyses to explore the effects of different participants population, probiotics species, and dosage.

Results

Thirty-six studies were included with 9312 participants. Probiotics reduced the incidence of AAD by 38% (pooled relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.74). The protective effect of probiotics was still significant when grouped by reasons for antibiotics treatment, probiotic duration, probiotic dosage, and time from antibiotic to probiotic. However, there were no statistically significant increased adverse events in the probiotics group (relative risk, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.14).

Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis suggested that using probiotics as early as possible during antibiotic therapy has a positive and safe effect on preventing AAD in adults. Further studies should focus on the optimal dosage and duration of probiotics to develop a specific recommendation.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^36bf3c9c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline—probiotics and prebiotic evidence in acute adult diarrheal infection—21/168 (12.5%) compared with 102/165 (62%) in the placebo arms had diarrhea lasting greater than 4 days, and when combined, these studies achieved a 79% efficacy (relative risk: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08–0.52). The one study with S. boulardii did not appear to confer any advantage on the primary or secondary outcomes evaluated. Based on the current evidence, there are not enough studies, which would support the recommended use of any particular probiotic product for treatment in acute adult diarrhea infection; although a statistically significant summary treatment effect was observed for Enterococcus LAB SF68, heterogeneity in results, theoretical safety concerns, and no recent studies with this product have been reported. While evidence supporting therapy of probiotics in treatment of acute diarrheal infection is lacking, there is supporting evidence for the role of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhea associated with antibiotic use, with pooled results among 63 randomized controlled trials indicating a relative risk reduction of 0.58 and a number needed to treat of 13.

### Probiotics and antibiotic-induced microbial aberrations in children: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^0cb9c88c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The supplemented genera Ligilactobacillus, Lactiplantibacillus, and Lactobacillus were found in higher abundance among children receiving probiotics. In addition to colonization of the supplemented probiotic strains, administration of probiotics may result in a broad range of changes in the taxonomic composition and function of the microbiome community.Consequently, probiotics may hypothetically have the potential to prevent antibiotic-associated adverse effects such as diarrhea.There are several mechanisms hypothesized for the development of diarrhea following administration of antibiotics. Antibiotics may lead to decreased intestinal epithelium function and a leaky gut, with increased risk for diarrhea. Lactobacillus species may prevent antibiotic-induced epithelium dysfunction and stimulate the gut barrier integrity.Antibiotic exposure leads to microbiota aberrations, accumulation of carbohydrates, and consequently reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). As SCFAs promote the absorption of water from the colon, a decrease in SCFAs provoke diarrhea.In children receiving probiotic supplements, we also observed a higher abundance of genus Coprococcus (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). As Coprococcus species and the different lactic acid bacteria that metabolize carbohydrates as a main carbon source play an important role in the digestion of carbohydrates into SCFAs, increased abundance of these taxa may lead to increased SCFA concentrations. This will stimulate water absorption and decrease the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea.Increased levels of SCFAs were found after supplementation of different Lactobacillus species in adults and animal models. These effects of probiotics on microbiota composition and function may consequently prevent AAD. Due to the limited number of children with diarrhea in this study (13 in the placebo group and 7 in the probiotic group), we were unable to perform subgroup analyses in children with and without diarrhea to further investigate the role of probiotics in AAD.

Studies measuring metabolite levels in antibiotic-exposed children receiving probiotics are lacking. Given the limited evidence, future mechanistic studies focusing on the microbiota function are warranted to elucidate the exact working mechanisms of probiotics. This may elucidate the optimal types, combination, dosing, and duration of probiotic therapy. These studies should also focus on long-term health outcomes of probiotic exposure, as this has not been studied.
