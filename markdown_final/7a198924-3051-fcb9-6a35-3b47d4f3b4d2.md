## Question

Weakness and loss of control in finger

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about weakness and loss of control in the fingers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical problem and establishing a working definition. Then, I should organize the differential diagnosis by neuroanatomic localization and pathophysiology. Next, I will prioritize the most likely etiologies and outline a diagnostic approach, including history, examination, and targeted testing. After that, I should consider special syndromes and mimics that can mislead localization. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight red flags and pitfalls, making sure I verify each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. "Weakness and loss of control" in the fingers implies reduced force production and impaired dexterity, often reflecting deficits in strength, coordination, or both, and can arise from central or peripheral causes; I need to ensure I distinguish true weakness from fatigue, pain-limited movement, or functional disorders before proceeding [^96ffa385].

> I will now examine the differential by localization, starting with central causes. Stroke is a leading cause of finger weakness and loss of control, with weakness often accompanied by spasticity and altered activation patterns; importantly, weakness accounts for the largest portion of variance in hand impairment after stroke, and cortical motor areas may remain functionally intact even when corticospinal pathways are injured, which shapes rehabilitation strategies [^5948129a] [^e61a75c8]. Hold on, I should verify the role of spasticity versus weakness; a nerve blockade study shows that inappropriate flexor activation and spasticity contribute to limited finger extension, but weakness remains a dominant driver of impairment, reinforcing the need to target strength and motor control in therapy [^9d0f8494].

> Next, I should review cervical cord pathology. Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a key consideration in adults over 50 with progressive hand clumsiness, gait imbalance, and hyperreflexia; MRI confirms cord compression and early surgical decompression improves outcomes, so I need to keep a low threshold for imaging and referral when the phenotype fits [^f85439fe]. But wait, what if the pattern is purely motor and distal? Cervical radiculopathy, especially C8–T1, can cause hand intrinsic weakness and finger flexor/extensor weakness with minimal sensory change, and clinical findings related to the fingers are among the most accurate for localizing a single-level disc herniation, which can guide targeted imaging and management [^38caa3a0] [^3b96a703].

> Let me consider peripheral nerve etiologies next. Carpal tunnel syndrome is common and can produce thenar weakness and loss of fine control; severity classifications integrate sensory and motor deficits, and thumb abduction weakness correlates with advanced disease, so I should confirm with electrodiagnostics when suspected [^d569d2f8]. Ulnar neuropathy causes intrinsic hand weakness, clawing, and loss of key pinch; deficits differ subtly between above- and below-elbow lesions, and early recognition informs surgical planning and rehabilitation expectations [^f42105a1] [^bf24d771]. Radial nerve palsy produces wrist and finger drop, with tendon transfers or nerve transfers offering functional restoration depending on timing and level of injury, so I need to check for trauma, humeral fracture, or iatrogenic causes and act within the window for reinnervation [^087eb5d9].

> I should confirm the pattern of multifocal motor neuropathy, which often presents with asymmetric distal upper limb weakness, frequently affecting finger extensors more than flexors, and may show weakness out of proportion to atrophy; conduction block and anti-GM1 antibodies support the diagnosis, and IVIg is first-line therapy, so I need to ensure comprehensive electrophysiology and serologic testing when this pattern is suspected [^f806daab] [^41205e38]. Hold on, I should verify that conduction block can be proximal and hard to detect; yes, proximal stimulation and careful study design are often required to demonstrate block, which can delay diagnosis if not pursued [^41205e38].

> Now, motor neuron disease. ALS frequently begins distally in the hands and exhibits a split-hand pattern with preferential involvement of the thenar eminence and first dorsal interosseus; pinch strength correlates with disease burden and can serve as a practical biomarker, so I should screen for UMN signs and arrange EMG when suspected [^dcf5f3ad] [^289e60f9]. Wait, let me verify the differential for split-hand; while classic for ALS, it can rarely occur in other disorders such as GARS1-associated neuropathy, so I should not overinterpret this sign in isolation [^330aa3a6].

> I will now examine myopathies. Inclusion body myositis produces progressive, often asymmetric weakness with a predilection for finger flexors and knee extensors; diagnosis is delayed on average 4–9 years, so I should maintain suspicion in older adults with distal weakness and request muscle biopsy when indicated [^91643bff]. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 also causes distal upper limb weakness with myotonia and can impair hand function; recognizing the systemic features and genetic testing implications is essential for comprehensive care [^8607ab69]. Let me reconsider the broader differential for finger flexor-predominant weakness; other myopathies can mimic IBM, so I need to integrate histopathology, electrodiagnostics, and genetics when the presentation is atypical or refractory to initial assumptions [^8bf8ca76].

> Next, I should review hereditary neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease commonly causes intrinsic hand muscle atrophy, clawing, and loss of grip and pinch strength, with hand dysfunction often under-recognized early; patient-reported outcomes emphasize hand weakness as a major driver of participation restrictions, so I should proactively assess hand function and offer adaptive strategies [^d7ec3c8c]. I need to ensure I screen for superimposed entrapment neuropathies such as CTS, which are more prevalent in CMT and can further degrade function if untreated [^efa19a6f].

> But wait, what if the "loss of control" reflects a movement disorder rather than weakness? Parkinson's disease can manifest with finger abduction weakness and loss of higher-frequency tremor components off medication, linking dopaminergic deficits to both force and physiological tremor; I should consider medication states and perform targeted examination when bradykinesia or rigidity coexist [^852f0ec7]. Functional neurological symptom disorder can mimic focal hand weakness; validated examination techniques can help distinguish functional from organic weakness, though I must apply these carefully and avoid premature closure [^ae893b56].

> I should double-check for special syndromes that can mislead localization. FEWDON-MND presents with slowly progressive finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus, with chronic motor axon loss on EMG; recognizing this pattern prevents mislabeling as ALS or MMN and directs appropriate counseling and follow-up [^76452b26]. Hirayama disease, a juvenile asymmetric distal upper limb weakness with cold paresis, reflects dynamic cervical cord compression and can be differentiated from mimics by flexion MRI and clinical phenotype, which matters for prognosis and management [^b1b9260c].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. History should map tempo, symmetry, sensory involvement, cranial or bulbar features, family history, trauma, and exposures; examination should grade strength, identify UMN signs, localize to specific nerves or roots, and screen for functional signs. I need to ensure I do not anchor on a single nerve territory without considering combined or proximal lesions [^96ffa385]. Electrodiagnostics (NCS/EMG) are pivotal for distinguishing radiculopathy, neuropathy, motor neuron disease, and myopathy, and should be tailored to the suspected localization; MRI of the brain, cervical spine, or brachial plexus is indicated for central or compressive etiologies; and targeted labs (CK, TSH, glucose, autoimmune panels, genetic testing) refine the differential when suggested by phenotype [^96ffa385].

> I will now examine management principles, keeping them etiology-specific. For stroke, task-specific rehabilitation, spasticity management, and emerging modalities such as brain–machine interfaces can augment recovery; I should confirm candidacy and set expectations based on baseline severity and cortical plasticity potential [^2576d62c]. For compressive myelopathy, timely surgical decompression improves neurological outcomes, so I must expedite referral when cord compression is documented or strongly suspected [^f85439fe]. For CTS and ulnar neuropathy, conservative measures, injections, and surgery have evidence-based roles; for radial palsy, tendon or nerve transfers within the reinnervation window are key, and I should coordinate with hand surgery early [^d569d2f8] [^087eb5d9]. For MMN, IVIg is first-line and often requires high or repeated dosing; I should monitor for axonal loss and adjust treatment to preserve strength [^41205e38]. For ALS, multidisciplinary care, respiratory surveillance, and disease-modifying therapy are standard; for IBM, exercise therapy and assistive devices mitigate disability while disease-modifying trials continue [^dcf5f3ad] [^56fc5979]. For hereditary neuropathies, orthoses, adaptive strategies, and selective surgical procedures can preserve function; I should align choices with patient goals and disease stability [^34620711].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address red flags and pitfalls. Rapidly progressive weakness, respiratory or bulbar involvement, severe pain, or new bowel/bladder dysfunction warrant urgent evaluation for compressive or life-threatening causes; misattributing myelopathy to peripheral neuropathy or functional weakness can delay decompression and worsen outcomes, so I should maintain diagnostic vigilance and escalate promptly when indicated [^f85439fe]. I should confirm that I have not overlooked treatable mimics such as MMN, cervical radiculopathy, or entrapment neuropathies, and I should revisit the diagnosis if the course deviates from expectations or if new features emerge [^41205e38] [^38caa3a0].

Finger weakness and loss of control most often reflect **distal nerve compression** (carpal tunnel, ulnar, or radial neuropathies) [^d569d2f8] [^f42105a1] [^087eb5d9], **cervical radiculopathy** (especially C8–T1) [^38caa3a0] [^3b96a703], or **neurodegenerative disease** (ALS, IBM, CMT) [^dcf5f3ad] [^56fc5979] [^d7ec3c8c]. Less common causes include stroke, Parkinson's, myasthenia gravis, and functional disorders [^5948129a] [^852f0ec7] [^ae893b56]. Evaluation should start with a **focused history and exam** [^96ffa385], then use **EMG/NCS** to localize and characterize the deficit [^96ffa385], and add MRI or labs as indicated [^96ffa385]. Management is cause-specific: decompression for entrapment, immunotherapy for immune neuropathies, disease-modifying therapy for neurodegeneration, and rehabilitation for all [^d569d2f8] [^41205e38] [^1971a16b].

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: onset, progression, symmetry, sensory symptoms, pain, trauma, systemic features, family history [^96ffa385].
- **Examination**: strength (MRC), atrophy, fasciculations, tone, reflexes, sensory loss, coordination, functional tests (grip, pinch, fine motor) [^7920d26e].
- **Electrodiagnostic studies**: EMG and nerve conduction studies to localize and characterize neuropathy, radiculopathy, or myopathy [^96ffa385].
- **Imaging**: MRI for cervical spine, brain, or brachial plexus when indicated [^f85439fe].
- **Laboratory tests**: CK, autoimmune panels, genetic testing as indicated [^96ffa385].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Peripheral nerve compression**: splinting, activity modification, corticosteroid injections, surgical decompression [^d569d2f8].
- **Cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy**: conservative care (PT, NSAIDs), surgical decompression for progressive deficits [^f85439fe].
- **Neurodegenerative diseases**: disease-modifying therapy (e.g. IVIg for MMN) [^41205e38], rehabilitation, orthoses, adaptive devices [^1971a16b].
- **Central nervous system disorders**: stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's medications, MS disease-modifying therapies.
- **Neuromuscular junction disorders**: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppression, IVIg.
- **Functional disorders**: psychotherapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause**: compressive neuropathies often improve with treatment [^d569d2f8], whereas neurodegenerative diseases progress and cause lasting disability [^dcf5f3ad]. Complications include chronic pain, contractures, loss of independence, and psychological impact [^1971a16b].

---

Finger weakness and loss of control arise from diverse causes; a **focused history, exam, and targeted testing** enable accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, with prognosis ranging from reversible deficits to progressive disability depending on etiology.

### Weakness is the primary contributor to finger impairment in chronic stroke [^5948129a]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relative contributions of several neurologic and biomechanic impairment mechanisms to overall finger and hand impairment in chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors.

Design

Repeated-measures design.

Setting

Clinical research laboratory.

Participants

Thirty stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis. Fifteen subjects had severe hand motor impairment and 15 had moderate impairment, as measured with the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

The biomechanic factors stiffness and resting flexion torque, together with the neurologic factors spasticity, strength, and coactivation, were quantified by using a custom hand manipulator, a dynamometer, and electromyographic recordings. Both passive and active rotations of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers were examined.

Results

Although subjects in the severely impaired group exhibited statistically greater passive stiffness and resting flexion torque than their moderately impaired counterparts (P<.05), the overall effect of these biomechanic changes appeared small in relation to the deficits attributable to neurologic changes such as spasticity and, especially, weakness. In fact, weakness in grip strength and isometric extension accounted for the greatest portion of the variance between the 2 groups (eta(2)=.40 and eta(2)=.23, respectively).

Conclusions

Thus, deficits in hand motor control after stroke seem to derive mainly from weakness, which may be attributable to the loss of descending corticospinal pathway activation of motoneurons.

2.5 Inclusion body myositis

Myopathies are a diverse group of conditions that include inherited or sporadic forms, some with systemic involvement such as the mitochondrial myopathies, and cause progressive muscle degeneration resulting in muscle weakness, atrophy, and joint contractures. Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a progressive inflammatory myopathy characterized by weakness of the deep finger flexors (flexor digitorum profundus) and knee extensors, and dysphagia. Onset is usually after 40 years of age, more common in males, and diagnosis is based on muscle histopathological features.Progressive loss of hand function is a feature of IBM, with hand grip and fine motor task impairments associated with inability to flex distal and sometimes proximal interphalangeal (IP) joints. Typical progression, although generally slow, is associated with marked morbidity and reduced QOL,,with limited hand function associated with loss of independence in daily activities.

Difficulty with active finger flexion creates challenges with capturing hand and grip strength using standard tools such as handheld dynamometry. Compensatory techniques such as MCP and thenar flexion to produce a functional grip are often used.A study reported upper extremity function in 74 persons with IBM, identifying weaker grip strength than controls and more time to complete a functional dexterity test.Transverse volar grip strength correlated with disease duration, and hand weakness was greater in nonambulatory participants. Performance‐based tests are suggested to identify impairments and activity limitations that may not be captured with common grip strength tests.

### Motor cortex activation is preserved in patients with chronic hemiplegic stroke [^e61a75c8]. Annals of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Many central nervous system conditions that cause weakness, including many strokes, injure corticospinal tract but leave motor cortex intact. Little is known about the functional properties of surviving cortical regions in this setting, in part because many studies have used probes reliant on the corticospinal tract. We hypothesized that many features of motor cortex function would be preserved when assessed independent of the stroke-affected corticospinal tract. Functional MRI was used to study 11 patients with chronic hemiplegia after unilateral stroke that spared regions of motor cortex. Activation in stroke-affected hemisphere was evaluated using 3 probes independent of affected corticospinal tract: passive finger movement, a hand-related visuomotor stimulus, and tapping by the nonstroke index finger. The site and magnitude of cortical activation were similar when comparing the stroke hemisphere to findings in 19 control subjects. Patients activated each of 8 cortical regions with similar frequency as compared to controls, generally with a smaller activation volume. In some cases, clinical measures correlated with the size or the site of stroke hemisphere activation. The results suggest that, despite stroke producing contralateral hemiplegia, surviving regions of motor cortex actively participate in the same proprioceptive, visuomotor, and bilateral movement control processes seen in control subjects.

2.1 Friedreich ataxia

Friedreich ataxia (FA) is the most common inherited ataxia; the disease affects multiple regions of the central nervous system; the cerebellum, visual and vestibular systems in the brain, posterior columns, corticospinal, and spinocerebellar tracts in the spinal cord.There is also evidence of a sensory neuronopathy in up to 98% of people, that is often severe, but insidious in onset, so those with FA may not always notice a lack of sensation.Persons with FA (pwFA) can therefore exhibit both sensory and cerebellar ataxia, nonlength‐dependent sensory loss, spasticity, weakness, and fatigue, leading to decreased hand strength and dexterity.A study examining hands in pwFA found spasticity in 68%, contractures of at least one joint in 36.8%, weakness of intrinsic muscles in 84%, and finger hypermobility in nearly 95%, with the Functional Independence Measure significantly correlated with hand weakness and spasticity.Oculomotor dysfunction, including unstable fixation, is common,and can hinder both general function and the use of eye‐tracking computer controls intended to compensate for reduced hand function. Most pwFA develop varying degrees of scoliosis, which can impact positioning.Impaired trunk control and postural responses then contribute to upper extremity instability which further affects reaching capacity and hand function.

### Late reconstruction of ulnar nerve palsy [^f42105a1]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Ulnar nerve palsy results in significant loss of sensation and profound weakness, leading to a dysfunctional hand. Typical clinical findings include loss of key pinch, clawing, loss of normal flexion sequence of the digits, loss of the metacarpal arch, and abduction of the small finger. Further deficits in hand/wrist function are seen in high-level ulnar nerve palsy, including loss of ring- and small-finger distal interphalangeal flexion, decreased wrist flexion, and loss of dorsal sensory innervation. This article reviews the clinical findings seen in low and high ulnar nerve palsies, and reviews surgical options for correcting certain motor and sensory deficits.

2 Clinical Presentation

2.1 Typical Clinical Features

Asymmetric chronic or stepwise progressive weakness is the characteristic feature seen in 80%–100% of patients and leads to accumulation of disability over time. Weakness starts most commonly in the distal upper limb (60%–80%) while a smaller portion of patients have distal lower limb onset (15%–30%). Almost all patients will eventually have distal upper limb involvement which often becomes the most severely affected region. Within the distal upper limb, finger extensors are affected more commonly than flexors. Weakness usually follows the distribution of specific nerves and muscles within the same nerve distribution can be affected to different degrees, which can lead to the clinical finding of differential finger extension weakness.

Worsening weakness with cold exposure termed cold paresis is reported in up to 83% of MMN patients. While this symptom is not specific, it is five to six times more frequent in MMN patients when compared with patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or progressive muscular atrophy (PMA).

Muscle atrophy is eventually seen in nearly all patients, but a potential clue to an MMN diagnosis is weakness out of proportion to degree of atrophy especially in earlier stages. The degree of atrophy often correlates with disease duration. Other lower motor neuron findings including fasciculations and cramps are common, occurring in 20%–60% of patients, and reflexes are typically reduced or normal.

### Levodopa reversible loss of the piper frequency oscillation component in Parkinson's disease [^852f0ec7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although Parkinson's disease is typically characterised by bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor, the possibility that two additional motor deficits are manifest during small hand muscle activity was explored-namely, weakness and abnormal physiological tremor.

Methods

A paradigm previously used in normal subjects reliably records the strength, tremor and surface EMG of index finger abducting contractions against a compliant (elastic) resistance. In addition to the well known physiological tremor at around 10 Hz, there are other co existing peak tremor frequencies at around 20 and 40 Hz; the last of these frequencies corresponds to the range of EMG Piper rhythm. The same technique was used to study parkinsonian patients while on and off dopaminergic medication.

Results

The maximum strength of finger abduction produced by first dorsal interosseous contraction was considerably lower when patients were off medication (mean (SD) 6.27 (1.49) N when off v 12.33 (3.64) N when on). There was also a marked reduction in the power of Piper frequency finger tremor (p<0.0005) and EMG (p<0.0005) oscillations that did not simply result from weaker contraction.

Conclusion

As the components of physiological tremor at higher frequencies are thought to derive from CNS oscillations important in motor control, their loss in parkinsonism in association with severe off symptoms may represent an important pathophysiological link between dopaminergic depletion and parkinsonian motor deficits.

2.4 Hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy

Hereditary neuropathies encompass a broad range of heterogeneous genetic and phenotypic presentations from mild to severe disability, the most common of which is Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) or hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HSMN).Overall, about 75% of neuropathies (including HSMN) are length dependent, producing impairments of distal foot, ankle, hand, and finger strength, muscle atrophy, fatigue, sensory disturbance, cramps, pain, tremor, loss of motion and dexterity, and musculoskeletal deformities.

In CMT, the intrinsic hand muscles (interossei, lumbricals, thenar, and hypothenar) are preferentially affected, resulting in progressive clawing of the fingers due to unopposed long extensors and flexors, and loss of thumb opposition.With prolonged hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and flexion of proximal interphalangeal joints, stiffness and contractures develop which further impacts power grip. In total, there is a slowly progressive loss of tactile sensation, synchronistic finger flexion, adduction/abduction, thumb stability, hand grip and pinch strength.Hand involvement is not necessarily a late‐onset experience for people with CMT. In fact, hand impairments may be under‐recognized in early CMT1A. Burns et al.found in a cohort of 84 children aged 2–16 years reduced strength and function at the earliest stages of disease, which never improved to normal range throughout childhood.

People with CMT commonly report hand weakness as an issue that leads to restricted participation. The CMT Health Index was developed from an international registry survey of 407 participants (50.9% response rate) as a disease‐specific patient‐reported outcome measure (PROM) of symptom burden for all subtypes of CMT. Hand and finger weakness was the fourth most prevalent theme at 97%.In addition, Videler et al.reported that upper limb dysfunction was perceived by 98% of a CMT1A cohort (N = 49) and strongly correlated with restricted participation, while lower limb disability did not. Upper extremity weakness was cited as the most sensitive marker of overall disability and hand dexterity noted as essential for autonomy in ADLs.The most noted disease‐related limitations include difficulties with handwriting, dressing and undressing, personal care, and household activities.

### Relative preservation of finger flexion in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^49321653]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

A characteristic pattern of intrinsic hand muscle involvement--known as the split hand sign--is typical of ALS; differential involvement of forearm muscles has not been examined systematically. After observing that finger-flexion was often preserved in ALS, despite severe weakness of finger-extension, we assessed the relative involvement of these two muscle groups in a cohort of patients with ALS. We found finger-flexion to be relatively preserved, when compared with finger-extension, in patients with ALS. In many cases finger-flexion is only minimally affected, even when finger-extension is totally paralyzed. The reasons for this predilection are unclear, but may be similar to those underlying the split-hand sign. Nevertheless, the discrepancy may provide another useful clinical clue in patients presenting with distal upper-limb weakness.

### Tendon transfers, nerve grafts, and nerve transfers for isolated radial nerve palsy: a systematic review and analysis [^087eb5d9]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isolated radial nerve palsy results in loss of wrist, finger, and thumb extension.These deficits limit activities of daily living and decrease quality of life. Radial nerve deficits are frequently secondary to trauma; up to 20% of humerus fractures are complicated by radial nerve palsy. Other causes include iatrogenic injury, birth injury, and oncologic resections.

Given the significant morbidity of radial nerve palsy, surgical procedures have been developed to treat affected patients. The classic intervention is tendon transfer, in which an expendable donor muscle is used to perform the absent function. Although tendon transfer provides gross function, some feel outcomes lack subtle motor control.

Although nerve grafting restores function without donor muscle sacrifice, it requires a secondary donor nerve and accessible proximal and distal nerve stumps.As with any nerve-based reconstruction, reinnervation of the target muscle must be performed within 12 to 18 months from the date of injury, or irreversible motor end plate atrophy guarantees reconstructive failure.The best outcomes occur in young patients with small nerve gaps repaired 3 to 6 months after injury.

More recently, nerve transfers have become popular. These procedures combine the principles of tendon transfers and nerve grafting by coapting a terminal motor nerve from an expendable muscle to the motor nerve of the paralyzed target muscle. Although postoperative motor control may be more nuanced, the operation is dependent on nerve fiber growth across a nerve coaptation, requires lengthy rehabilitation periods, and has less reliable results.

There is no consensus on the optimal reconstructive technique for isolated radial nerve palsy. We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis to determine which technique was superior, as determined by the proportion of patients who achieved good results as measured by grading rubrics of function and strength. We then assessed comparisons based on the anatomical level of function, namely, assessing outcomes of each technique at the wrist and finger separately.

### Motor cortex organization after stroke is related to side of stroke and level of recovery [^257f2230]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The present study hypothesized that side of stroke and level of recovery influence motor system organization after stroke.

Methods

Functional MRI was performed on 14 control subjects and 21 patients with chronic stroke during index finger tapping (control subjects, right; patients, recovered side).

Results

On functional MRI, stroke patients with right arm involvement showed (1) significantly smaller activation in contralateral motor cortexes compared with control subjects; (2) smaller ipsilateral (nonstroke) premotor and larger contralateral (stroke-side) sensorimotor activation compared with patients with left arm involvement, although electromyogram across groups was similar; and (3) 2.7-fold-larger contralateral sensorimotor cortex activation, ventrally, in those with full recovery compared with those with partial recovery, despite similar tapping force, frequency, range of motion, and electromyogram between groups. Supplementary motor area activation was unrelated to level of recovery.

Conclusions

After stroke that causes mild to moderate initial impairment and mild residual hand weakness, cortical organization varies with side of injury and with final motor status. The findings may have implications for treatment after stroke.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^8607ab69]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an example of a dystrophy that preferentially affects the distal upper limb. An autosomal dominant multisystem disease, it causes a range of cardiorespiratory, genitourinary, ocular, endocrine, central nervous system and skeletal muscle impairments and is the most common inherited adult‐onset myopathy, with a prevalence estimated at 1 in 20,000 worldwide. There are four subtypes; congenital, childhood, adult and late onset, with more severe symptoms occurring at earlier ages of onset, and wide individual variability.Skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy generally begin in distal upper (particularly long finger flexors) and lower limbs, the neck, and slowly progress to the trunk. Myotonia, or delay in muscle relaxation, most commonly affects the forearm and finger muscles, is present in almost 100% of adult‐onset patients and is worsened with cold temperatures. DM1 may cause stiffness, pain, and prolonged hand grip, thus reducing manual dexterity. Upper limb muscle impairments have been associated with activity and participation limitations such as lifting and grasping objects, opening doors or jars, and household activities.An MRI study of upper limb weakness in 17 people with DM1 (pwDM1) demonstrated high‐intensity signals in the flexor digitorum profundus, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis, with proximal muscle involvement in prolonged disease.A study of a large cohort of adult and late onset pwDM1 confirmed a slow annual rate of decline on validated tests of hand grip strength, lateral pinch strength, gross and fine motor dexterity over a 9‐year period, with men demonstrating greater weakness and decline than women.

### Relative contributions of neural mechanisms versus muscle mechanics in promoting finger extension deficits following stroke [^9d0f8494]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

The origins of impaired finger and hand function were examined in 10 stroke survivors with chronic spastic hemiparesis, with the intent of assessing whether mechanical restraint or altered neurophysiological control mechanisms are responsible for the well-known impairment of finger extension. Simultaneous extension of all four metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the impaired hand was either externally imposed using a rotary actuator or attempted voluntarily by the subject. Trials were conducted both before and after administration of a local anesthetic, blocking the median and ulnar nerves at the elbow. The anesthetic was administered to reduce the activity of the muscles flexing the MCP joints, in order to distinguish mechanical from neuronal resistance to imposed MCP rotation. We found that the nerve blockade resulted in a reduction in velocity-dependent torque (P = 0.01), thereby indicating significant joint impedance due to spasticity. Blockade also produced a posture-dependent reduction in static torque in declaratively relaxed subjects (P = 0.04), suggesting some tonic flexor activity for specific hand postures. No change in either extensor isometric (P = 0.33) or isokinetic (0.53) torque was apparent, but 3 of the 10 subjects did exhibit substantial (>10 degrees ) improvement in voluntary MCP extension following the blockade. This improvement seemed largely due to a decrease in inappropriate flexor activity during the movement, rather than an increase in extensor activity. We argue that persistent and inappropriate flexor activation plays a role in limiting voluntary finger extension, and that this activation is potentially a reflection of altered supraspinal control of key spinal pathways. In all cases, this inappropriate activation was compounded by weakness, apparent in both the extensor and flexor muscles.

2.2 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease causing loss of motor neurons.In about 70% of cases, manifestations first occur in a single limb,most often distally, with approximately equal distribution between upper and lower limbs,and subsequent progressive involvement of other body regions. Persons with ALS (pwALS) display both upper motor neuron (spasticity, loss of motor speed, and precision) and lower motor neuron (fasciculations, atrophy, muscle weakness, and cramps) signs with few or no sensory changes.Many pwALS, especially with limb‐onset presentation,show a “split hand” pattern, in which the radial side of the hand, is preferentially affected compared with the muscles of the hypothenar eminence,despite sharing the same myotomes and, in the case of first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi, peripheral innervation.Reported in about 20% of pwALS by Kuwabara et al.50% in a 2021 systematic review,and even observed in up to 95% at follow‐up by some authors,this phenomenon seems to occur early in the disease course and is very rarely found in other neuromuscular diseases. Some pwALS may progressively develop bilateral, severely debilitating “flail arms”with complete upper extremity paralysis and secondary balance and mobility impairments. Whether through spasticity, loss of dexterity, or weakness, pwALS with hand involvement will demonstrate fine motor difficulties with functional implications.

2.3 Spinal muscular atrophy

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused, in about 95% of cases, by a homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene, resulting in progressive loss of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord,causing flaccid paralysis. The disease phenotype correlates with the number of SMN2 copies in one's genome, with a broad spectrum ranging from infants with symptom onset at birth or in the first weeks of life and never being able to sit, to milder adult‐onset forms.When upper limbs become involved, persons with SMA (pwSMA) usually develop earlier and more severe proximal weaknessand contractures,but eventually face issues with hand strength and range of motion (ROM), especially in cold conditions, that worsen with age and progressively impair independence.Some pwSMA also demonstrate hand joint hypermobilityand up to 59% of patients will demonstrate a fine hand tremor.

### Differentiating lower motor neuron syndromes [^12643708]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Key differentiating features

The LMN syndromes represent a group of conditions with a variety of presentations and varied underlying disease mechanisms. While a thorough clinical assessment and neurophysiology can usually delineate or assist in classification of the different syndromes, peripheral nerve and muscle imaging and the rapidly advancing field of NGS are additional diagnostic tools available to clinicians. Neurophysiological findings in the majority of LMN syndromes consist of axonal loss with a reduction in compound muscle action potential amplitudes with normal or slightly reduced motor conduction velocities. In contrast, findings suggestive of an immune-mediated motor neuropathy include features such as significantly reduced conduction velocities, focal partial motor conduction block and prolongation of F-wave latencies. While treatments are currently limited for most syndromes, immune-mediated LMN disorders may respond to immunotherapy and hence are important to distinguish from hereditary and degenerative causes.

Figure 4 outlines a diagnostic approach for the patient presenting with a LMN syndrome. Table 1 outlines the typical clinical features of the different LMN syndromes. An acute presentation of a LMN syndrome with onset over days to weeks should prompt consideration of an immune, toxic, metabolic or infective aetiology. The major differentials for a chronic monomelic or asymmetrical presentation include MND, MMN and MMA. Early involvement of finger and wrist extensors, focal motor conduction block on neurophysiology and/or the presence of anti-GM1 IgM antibody should prompt consideration of MMN as the diagnosis and warrants a treatment trial of IVIg. Positive symptoms, such as cramping and spasm are common in MMN. In contrast, positive symptoms are rarely a prominent presenting symptom in MND with negative features of LMN dysfunction dominating.

### Differential weakness of finger extensor muscles: a clinical pattern of multifocal motor neuropathy [^d1b71ecd]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several studies have suggested that differential weakness in muscles supplied by the same motor nerve supports the diagnosis of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN).

Methods

We describe the clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and laboratory findings of patients with a lower motor syndrome whose clinical presentation included differential finger extension weakness that we have seen in our neuromuscular clinic.

Results

We identified 3 patients with hand weakness and 1 patient with asymmetric weakness of the upper extremity. Conduction blocks (CBs) were identified in 1 patient. Anti-GM1 immunoglobulin M antibodies were detected in 2 of the 3 patients tested. Only 1 patient responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Rituximab was administered in another patient, but we did not detect a response.

Conclusions

We suggest that differential finger extension weakness is a feature that may be seen in MMN, even in the absence of CB or response to IVIg. Muscle Nerve 55: 433-437, 2017.

### Electrophysiological abnormalities in finger extension weakness and DOwnbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease: three new patients and review of the literature [^76452b26]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Finger Extension Weakness and DOwnbeat Nystagmus Motor Neuron Disease (FEWDON-MND) is characterized by motor weakness predominantly affecting finger extension, accompanied by downbeat nystagmus. To date, only 11 patients have been reported. The present study adds a further three and aims to provide a more detailed description of the electrodiagnostic features of these patients.

Methods

We present the clinical and electrophysiological features of three French patients from specialized motor neuron centers and review the electrophysiological findings of previously reported patients.

Results

These three patients presented with pure motor weakness affecting finger extension and downbeat nystagmus. They exhibited a slowly progressive disease course without respiratory involvement. Nerve conduction studies showed decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes in the extensor indicis muscles. Abnormal spontaneous activity on needle electromyography (EMG) was rare in two patients, absent in one, and otherwise limited to weak muscles. Additionally, chronic motor axon loss features suggestive of motor neuronopathy were seen in our patients. Importantly, they were also detected in distant asymptomatic muscles.

Discussion

The three patients reported here confirm the typical phenotype of FEWDON-MND, characterized by slowly progressive distal motor weakness initially affecting finger extension, associated with downbeat nystagmus. Although chronic motor axon loss features have been found in all reported patients, our three patients show that active denervation can be absent or rare. Thus, finger drop and diffuse chronic neurogenic changes on EMG should lead clinicians to look for downbeat nystagmus and to consider FEWDON-MND.

10 CONCLUSION

When I got back home from a 10‐week ICU (intensive care unit) visit, I was no longer able to drive my power wheelchair. I never realized that my wrist and hand was solicited to just drive my chair and move around. I then realized how important hands, fingers and wrists were and taken for granted. 1 hand, 1 wrist was my complete autonomy. Losing the little strength I had left in my right hand would make me so much more dependent of others. Luckily, my story allows me to gain some back after starting nusinersen. Gaining a little strength back in my hand and wrist allows me to be so much more independent. My hand and wrist allow me to use a computer and my phone on my own. I can work, read, do researches, keep contacts with friends… I feel complete, useful and never alone. I guess I can say that a big part of my autonomy is at the end of my fingers…

The hand is important in all aspects of our lives. A broad range of neuromuscular disorders including polyneuropathies, motor neuron diseases, and muscle disorders can cause hand and wrist impairments, which limits participation in self‐care, occupation, leisure activities, communication, social participation, and even healthcare access. Hand function should be assessed on a regular basis in pwNMDs. There is emerging evidence for the role of exercise in improving hand function and there are many adaptive devices to assist with daily activities and technology use which can be custom‐made or purchased off‐the shelf. Clinicians should get “all hands on deck”, partnering with persons with lived experience, family, caregivers, and allied health professionals such as occupational therapists to develop personalized solutions to improve hand function and QOL. More research is needed to identify the best modalities and optimal exercise prescriptions for people with different kinds of neuromuscular disorders, and the impact of assistive devices on functional outcomes and QOL. Beyond the clinic, neuromuscular clinicians should contribute to advocacy for increased accessibility to facilitate full participation and inclusion for people living with neuromuscular diseases.

### Finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease syndrome: a novel motor neuron disorder? [^1becbcc6]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We describe a novel motor syndrome, characterized by progressive muscle weakness with onset in finger extensor muscles and a downbeat nystagmus. In published reports of series of patients with downbeat nystagmus, a concomitant motor syndrome is not mentioned. 16, 17 As an acronym that captures the core clinical features for finger extensor weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease, we suggest FEWDON‐MND syndrome. With only 6 reported patients to date, the incidence is anticipated to be low. However, increased awareness of this clinical disease entity may lead to identification of additional patients and research into its pathophysiology.

The differential diagnosis of FEWDON‐MND syndrome is broad. The initial diagnoses included ALS, SMA, multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). MNDs or motor neuropathies often have onset in the distal upper extremities. However, onset with finger and wrist extensor muscle weakness is not frequent. MMN can start with finger extension weakness 18 ; however, none of the patients had signs of demyelination on electrodiagnostic testing or positive monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) antibodies. Low‐titer GAD antibodies were found in 1 patient. GAD antibodies can present with ataxia or eye movement disorders, including downbeat nystagmus. However, in 5 of our patients, those antibodies were negative. In addition, muscle paresis is not described in patients with GAD antibodies. 19

3 Results

The clinical, imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and electrodiagnostic findings of the three patients are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

TABLE 1 
Clinical, imaging, and electrodiagnostic findings of the three patients with FEWDON‐MND.

TABLE 2 
Nerve conduction studies of the three patients with FEWDON‐MND.

3.1 Patient 1

A 45‐year‐old man without a family history of neurological disease presented with a 15‐year history of finger drop. Since his twenties, he had noted oscillopsia. When he was around 30 years of age, he developed a bilateral finger drop, which slowly progressed over the years. His neurological examination at 45 years of age was remarkable for distal weakness predominantly involving finger extension in the upper limbs and ankle dorsiflexion in the lower limbs (Table 1). Finger extension was more severely affected in the third and fourth digits of the left hand (grade 2) compared to the other fingers (grade 3). Rare fasciculations were observed in the forearms. The sensory examination was normal. A bilateral postural tremor was noted in the upper limbs. Downbeat nystagmus was noted, present in the primary position but increased in lateral gazes. The nerve conduction study (NCS) demonstrated low compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitudes in both radial nerves (Table 2). Needle electromyography (EMG) found rare abnormal spontaneous activity in combination with signs of diffuse chronic axon loss during contraction (Table 1). Extensive diagnostic blood tests were unremarkable (Table S1), except for the blood creatine kinase (CK) level that was mildly elevated (297 UI/L, N < 200 UI/L); CSF analysis was also normal. No intronic GGGGCC expansion was found in C9ORF72. Gene panel analyses for hereditary neuropathies and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Table S2) were negative. Whole exome sequencing (parents‐child trio) did not find any pathogenic variants, but only a heterozygous variant of unknown significance in ALS2 (NM_020919.3, c.145G>A, p.Gly49Arg), also present in his asymptomatic mother. After 2 years of follow‐up, the patient was stable. He was able to walk without assistance.

### A biosynthetic thumb prosthesis [^f0aadc87]. NPJ Biomedical Innovations (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The thumb is considered clinically to be the most important digit on the hand, responsible for approximately 40% of hand function –. The thumb’s core role is opposition, which is critical for grasp and pinch. Natural opposition requires an ability to trace the tip of the thumb along the tips of the remaining four fingers. In the intact hand, this ability is a direct result of thumb’s position on the hand and complex anatomical structure. The interphalangeal (IP) joint, which is the thumb’s most distal joint, plays a crucial role in functional opposition pinch, accounting for up to 31% of pinch strength and ensuring fingertip-to-thumb-tip contact,. The rich sensory information from the skin at the thumb tip allows for robust closed-loop control of pinch and grasp force, as well as perception of texture, slip, and temperature. The skin also acts as a barrier to external insult such as infection.

Catastrophic injury to the thumb is fairly common: approximately 6 million digital amputations occur annually worldwide, one third of which include loss of at least one thumb joint. Because the thumb plays such a critical role in hand function, its loss can have tangible effects on lifestyle. This is especially true in populations who rely on their hands for manual labor, which incidentally predisposes them to these very amputations; loss of the thumb can inhibit their ability to perform work functions, creating financial strain or necessitating a shift in career. More broadly, partial hand amputation is linked directly to decreases in mental health and overall quality of life, with a large portion of the deficit related to functional impairment. While biological reconstruction using native tissues is typically favored, it is not always possible. In such cases, we face the task of reproducing the function of the lost biological digit via synthetic prostheses. For some of these functions (e.g. actuation, mechanical strength), synthetic components (motors, titanium) outperform the biological systems (muscles, bone) that they are intended to replace –. However, other functions, such the skin’s ability to sense the environment and protect from infection, have proven particularly challenging to replicate with synthetic components –. As a result, it has been difficult to create synthetic digits that look, feel, and behave like their biological counterparts –.

### Kinetic and kinematic workspaces of the index finger following stroke [^1b3330af]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore motor impairment of the index finger following stroke. More specifically, the kinetics and kinematics of the index finger were analysed throughout its workspace. Twenty-four stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis of the hand participated in the trials, along with six age-matched controls. Hand impairment was classified according to the clinical Chedoke-McMaster Stage of Hand scale. Subjects were instructed to generate fingertip force in six orthogonal directions at five different positions within the workspace. Split-plot analysis of variance revealed that clinical impairment level had a significant effect on measured force (P < 0.001), with the weakness in stroke survivors being directionally dependent (P < 0.01). Electromyographic recordings revealed altered muscle activation patterns in the more impaired subjects. Unlike the control subjects, these subjects exhibited peak muscle excitation of flexor digitorum superficialis, extensor digitorum communis and first dorsal interosseous during the generation of fingertip flexion forces. Subjects also attempted to reach locations scattered throughout the theoretical workspace of the index finger. Quantification of the active kinematic workspace demonstrated a relationship between impairment level and the percentage of the theoretical workspace that could be attained (P < 0.001). The stroke survivors exhibited a high correlation between mean force production and active workspace (R = 0.90). Thus, our data suggest that altered muscle activation patterns contribute to directionally dependent weakness following stroke. Both the modulation of muscle excitation with force direction and the independence of muscle activation seem to be reduced. These alterations translate into a significantly reduced active range of motion for the fingers.

### Management of a thumb-in-palm deformity in adult patients with upper motor neuron syndrome [^013e7972]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The thumb-in-palm (TIP) deformity in adults with upper motor neuron syndrome results from an imbalance of extrinsic and intrinsic muscular forces. Traditionally, the thumb is adducted against the index ray, and flexed to varying degrees at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. However, not all TIP deformities result from the same underlying imbalances. The severity of the deformity ranges over a spectrum dependent upon the involved muscle groups and underlying spasticity, myostatic contracture, and/or joint contractures. Surgical procedures for correcting a TIP deformity can be classified broadly as procedures used for functional, present volitional motor control, versus nonfunctional, absent motor control. Techniques include tenotomies, tenodeses, tendon lengthenings, tendon transfers, tendon reroutings, neurectomies, and joint releases. A focused physical examination is key in developing a patient-specific treatment algorithm.

### Clinical reasoning: a 55-year-old woman with painless hand weakness and atrophy [^e6569d08]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hand weakness is a frequent chief concern in neurology practice. We report a case of a 55-year-old woman presenting with a chronic, gradually worsening right hand weakness and atrophy, selectively affecting the thenar muscles, without any sensory symptoms. She had a history of carpal tunnel syndrome and previously underwent surgical carpal tunnel release. This case delves into the differential diagnosis of hand weakness and atrophy, emphasizing the significance of myotomal innervation in intrinsic hand muscles. Furthermore, it outlines a systematic approach to diagnosing an uncommon cause for a common clinical presentation, offering a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and exploring various possible causes.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^38caa3a0]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy due to CDH—clinical localization is summarized as follows: Objective muscle weakness corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 77% and 12%, respectively. All cases of objective weakness in which root C5 or C8 was involved, the level was correctly localized. Sensory loss corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 65% and 35%, respectively. Author conclusions (relative to question): Clinical findings related to the fingers are the most accurate for localizing a CDH to a single level. A single level CDH may produce signs and symptoms that correspond to overlapping dermatomal levels.

### Muscle hypoxia in rheumatoid hands: does it play a role in ulnar drift? [^31f0d58d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The cause of ulnar drift in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. It may occur because of external forces applied to the fingers during normal use. Alternatively, it may arise after changes in the internal forces on the anatomy of the digits owing to alterations in the supporting structures of the joints or their control mechanisms, or both. Intrinsic muscle tightness, which is commonly seen in RA hands, may be the result of adaptive shortening or a direct consequence of RA. Previous studies carried out by our group have shown that joints, tendons, and associated synovium in RA hands are consistently hypoxic. Therefore, we formed the hypothesis that there is a difference in hand/forearm muscle oxygen tension in RA versus non-RA.

Methods

We measured tissue oxygen levels in the intrinsic muscles of the hands and forearm muscles of 29 patients with a diagnosis of RA, who were undergoing elective surgery. We measured oxygen levels using a microelectrode technique. A total of 31 patients without RA undergoing elective surgery served as matched controls.

Results

Our results show that the intrinsic muscles of RA patients are significantly more hypoxic than in non-RA controls. Moreover, there is a trend in the RA group for increasing hypoxia in a radial-to-ulnar direction when comparing the different intrinsic muscle groups. We also demonstrate that forearm and thenar and hypothenar muscles are significantly more hypoxic in RA versus non-RA patients.

Conclusions

The intrinsic muscle weakness, intrinsic tightness, and muscle wasting observed in RA may not be due to disuse atrophy resulting from joint disease. From our data, we speculate that these changes may be the result of direct muscular involvement in RA leading to muscle hypoxia.

### Exploring challenges in the management and treatment of inclusion body myositis [^91643bff]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES

IBM is clinically characterized by chronic, slowly progressive weakness, often asymmetric, presenting with predominant finger flexor and/or knee extensor involvement [,–]. However, less common presentations of this disease can occur in approximately 14% of patients including isolated dysphagia, foot drop, proximal upper limb weakness, axial weakness with head drop, and facial diplegia. Furthermore, IBM may be diagnosed even at a preclinical stage manifesting with elevated creatine kinase levels. The lingering course, the variable presentations, and the distal asymmetric weakness, mimicking a mononeuropathy (e.g. ulnar) or a motor neuron disorder, can be challenging for providers to recognize and result in diagnostic delay with time from symptom onset to diagnosis ranging from 4 to 9 years on average.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^64b85b40]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

5 GRIPS AND ORTHOSES

Upper extremity use depends on functional grip, hand dexterity, and the ability to position its different segments in space. The distal upper extremity “position of function” places the wrist in ~20° extension, and approximate flexion of MCPs, proximal and distal IPs at 45°, 30°, and 20°, respectively, with the thumb straight and relaxed.

With progressive intrinsic muscle atrophy, the hand adopts a clawed, “intrinsic minus” position. Wrist extension weakness further contributes to this nonfunctional configuration,impairing ability to perform key types of grip, which are typically divided into two main types: power and precision (or pinch),as illustrated in Figure 2. Orthotic devices, defined as “externally applied device[s] used to compensate for impairments of the structure and function of the neuromuscular and skeletal systems”aim to maintain or support one's capacity to perform these grips (Figure 3).

### The biomechanical basis of the claw finger deformity: a computational simulation study [^e729322d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Claw finger deformity occurs during attempted finger extension in patients whose intrinsic finger muscles are weakened or paralyzed by neural impairments. The deformity is generally not acutely present after intrinsic muscle palsy. The delayed onset, with severity progressing over time, suggests soft tissue changes that affect the passive biomechanics of the hand exacerbate and advance the deformity. Clinical interventions may be more effective if such secondary biomechanical changes are effectively addressed. Using a computational model, we simulated these altered soft tissue biomechanical properties to quantify their effects on coordinated finger extension.

Methods

To evaluate the effects of maladaptive changes in soft tissue biomechanical properties on the development and progression of the claw finger deformity after intrinsic muscle palsy, we completed 45 biomechanical simulations of cyclic index finger flexion and extension, varying the muscle excitation level, clinically relevant biomechanical factors, and wrist position. We evaluated to what extent (1) increased joint laxity, (2) decreased mechanical advantage of the extensors about the proximal interphalangeal joint, and (3) shortening of the flexor muscles contributed to the development of claw finger deformity in an intrinsic-minus hand model.

Results

Of the mechanisms studied, shortening (or contracture) of the extrinsic finger flexors was the factor most associated with the development of claw finger deformity in simulation.

Conclusions

These simulations suggest that adaptive shortening of the extrinsic finger flexors is required for the development of claw finger deformity. Increased joint laxity and decreased extensor mechanical advantage only contributed to the severity of the deformity in simulations when shortening of the flexor muscles was present.

Clinical Relevance

In both the acute and chronic stages of intrinsic finger paralysis, maintaining extrinsic finger flexor length should be an area of focus in rehabilitation to prevent formation of the claw finger deformity and achieve optimal outcomes after surgical interventions.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^34620711]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical procedures for improving hand function are rarely considered in neuromuscular disease, and there is little literature available to guide decision‐making. An experienced hand surgeon familiar with neuromuscular patients should be consulted, in collaboration with the pwNMD, their caregivers and rehabilitation team. Personal goals, stability of disease, adequate support in the perioperative period, and ability to follow through on postoperative care and rehabilitation are important factors in selecting surgical candidates. Contracture release may be employed on rare occasions when nonsurgical treatments have failed and there is a clear attainable functional goal or prevention/treatment of complications identified.In the case of CMT and polyneuropathy due to distal to proximal progression of muscle weakness, surgery is palliative but has potential to prolong dexterity and autonomy. Thumb and index instability, pinch weakness, lack of opposition, and synchronized finger movements as well as clawing are primary concerns that may benefit from surgical consultation following initiation of conservative options. Dynamic procedures can be considered for patients with strong wrist muscles. Forearm muscle weakness follows preferential involvement of median and ulnar innervated intrinsic muscles in CMT, thus radial muscles are least affected early on, and are most useful for tendon transfers. Additional considerations: donor muscle‐tendon units will lose one grade of strength after transfer, work best when synergistic with recipient muscles, and force is proportional to muscle cross‐sectional area at rest. Pre‐operative EMG is helpful to confirm the health of donor muscles during surgical planning.

Opponensplasty procedures have been used successfully to improve thumb opposition in CMT and low median neuropathy, such as radial innervated ECU to EPB and EIP to APB, or fourth digit FDS to APB transfers. The Zancolli lasso dynamic procedure for claw fingers divides FDS at its insertion on the middle phalanx, loops around the A1 pulley and is sutured onto itself to create flexion at the MCP joints when there are limited donor tendons and active extension is observed in IP joints when MCPs are flexed. A suggested alternative is the Brand ECRB transfer with grafting. Only static procedures can be used in patients without active wrist or hand muscles as joint stabilization is the goal and weakness cannot be corrected. Examples include thumb metacarpal, trapeziometacarpal, and IP joint fusions, or Zancolli volar plate advancement and various tenodeses for finger clawing.When clinically indicated, nerve entrapment release may also be performed in select patients as discussed previously in this review.

### Peripheral neuropathy: pattern recognition for the pragmatist [^d5e30a0f]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Long lists of causes of peripheral neuropathy make peripheral nerve disease a dry and uninspiring subject. A simple scheme based on the answers to just six questions should enable the clinician to recognise characteristic patterns, investigate relevant subgroups appropriately, and identify treatable disorders quickly: which systems are involved? What is the distribution of weakness? What is the nature of the sensory involvement? Is there any evidence of upper motor neuron involvement? What is the temporal evolution? Is there any evidence for a hereditary neuropathy? Standard screening investigations suffice for the common length dependent axonal neuropathies while complex presentations need more detailed investigations targeted to their clinical phenotype.

### Intrinsic contracture of the hand: diagnosis and management [^bfd432c1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Intrinsic contracture of the hand may result from trauma, spasticity, ischemia, rheumatologic disorders, or iatrogenic causes. In severe cases, the hand assumes a posture with hyperflexed metacarpophalangeal joints and hyperextended proximal interphalangeal joints as the contracted interossei and lumbrical muscles deform the natural cascade of the fingers. Considerable disability may result because weakness in grip strength, difficulty with grasping larger objects, and troubles with maintenance of hygiene commonly encumber patients. Generally, the diagnosis is made via history and physical examination, but adjunctive imaging, rheumatologic testing, and electromyography may aid in determining the underlying cause or assessing the severity. Nonsurgical management may be appropriate in mild cases and consists of occupational therapy, orthoses, and botulinum toxin injections. The options for surgical management are diverse and dictated by the cause and severity of contracture.

A 36-year-old man had a 6-year history of progressive left hand and finger extension weakness. Extensive electrophysiological studies showed only a partial motor conduction block along the left radial nerve at the mid-arm. Several intravenous immunoglobulin treatments were clinically successful. A 3-year follow-up did not show any clinical or electrophysiological involvement of other nerves. A monofocal motor neuropathy, as a variant of multifocal motor neuropathy, was diagnosed.

### An expanded cortical representation for hand movement after peripheral motor denervation [^743dba7a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Functional reorganisation of the motor or sensory cortex has been demonstrated in animals after section of mixed peripheral nerves. Here functional changes in the motor cortex specifically after peripheral motor denervation in humans are investigated.

Methods

Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to study brain activation during a finger flexion-extension task in patients with a late onset, acquired pure motor neuropathy (n=6), contrasting results with those from patients with pure sensory neuropathies (n=4) or healthy controls (n=7).

Results

Increases in the extent of activation in the motor cortex both ipsilateral and contralateral to the hand moved were found in the patients with motor neuropathy. The neuroanatomical localisation of the mixed contralateral sensorimotor cortex activation volume was more posterior for the patients with motor neuropathy than for the healthy controls (mean difference, 12 mm, p<0.05). The pure sensory neuropathy group by contrast showed no change in the extent of activation relative to healthy controls and a trend for more anterior primary sensorimotor cortex activation (p<0.06). To test whether the increased activation volumes found in patients with motor neuropathy were a result simply of factors such as increased effort with movement rather than the motor denervation, patients with hand weakness from inclusion body myositis (n=4) were studied while making similar hand movements. No differences in either the numbers of significantly activated voxels or in their localisation were found relative to healthy controls (n=10).

Conclusions

These results provide a novel demonstration that peripheral denervation (as distinguished from factors related to weakness) leads to functional reorganisation of the sensorimotor cortex in the adult brain. This suggests that adaptive responses to motor denervation involve the central as well as the peripheral nervous system.

### Inclusion body myositis. clinical features and clinical course of the disease in 64 patients [^3bdd686b]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical features of inclusion body myositis (IBM) were of minor importance in the design of consensus diagnostic criteria, mainly because of controversial views on the specificity of signs and symptoms, although some authors reported "typical" signs. To re-assess the clinical spectrum of IBM, a single investigator using a standard protocol studied a cohort of 64 patients cross-sectionally. Symptom onset was before the age of 50 years in 20% of cases. Only a few patients (14 %) started with weakness other than that of quadriceps, finger flexor or pharyngeal muscles. The sequence of power loss was erratic, but onset of symptoms with quadriceps weakness predicted an earlier onset of dysphagia in older patients (> or = 56 years) compared with younger ones (< 56 years) (p = 0.02). Despite widespread weakness patients had favourable scores on three commonly used function scales and they kept their employment. Complete wheel-chair dependency was rare (3 %). A dominant characteristic was the anatomical distribution of afflicted muscles: ventral extremity muscle groups were more affected than dorsal muscle groups and girdle muscles were least affected, the latter preserving postural stability. Ankylosis, especially in extension of the fingers,was frequently present. Together with the sparing of intrinsic hand muscles it was helpful in the preservation of many skillful movements. IBM has a unique distribution of muscle weakness. Ankylotic contractures are common. We feel that their joint impact on daily functioning is characteristic for the disease.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^d569d2f8]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome classification—severity-based clinical and electrodiagnostic criteria: Carpal tunnel syndrome is most commonly classified by severity (mild, moderate, severe, or extreme). According to Gelberman et al, mild CTS included a symptom duration of less than 1 year with diffuse complaints, intermittent numbness, normal 2-point discrimination (2PD), absence of weakness or atrophy, and nerve conduction velocities increased only by 1 to 2 m/s with no fibrillations on electromyographic testing, whereas advanced CTS was characterized by permanent sensory and motor loss and thenar muscle atrophy. Maggard et al defined mild disease as all 3 of: symptom pattern at least characteristic of CTS, intermittent symptoms, and no abnormalities of physical exam; moderate CTS included symptom pattern at least characteristic of CTS, no thenar atrophy, and at least 1 of constant symptoms, thenar musculature weakness, or loss of sensory function in fingers 1, 2, or 3; and severe disease included symptom pattern at least characteristic of CTS and thenar muscle atrophy, and a Delphi consensus study identified thenar muscle atrophy, location/presence of sensory symptoms, nocturnal symptoms, and APB muscle weakness among the top 5 diagnostic criteria.

Cardiac amyloidosis—when to involve a neurologist and diagnostic evaluation details: symptoms of polyneuropathy typically begin symmetrically with numbness, paresthesia, or pain in the toes and feet and are worse at the end of the day or at nighttime; as symptoms progress, the fingertips may be involved, distal weakness first affects the toe extensors then the ankle dorsiflexors, and proprioceptive sensory loss in the feet causes gait imbalance; autonomic symptoms may include orthostatic hypotension, alternating diarrhea and constipation and night diarrhea, urinary retention, and sexual dysfunction; on physical examination there may be distal muscle weakness, distal sensory loss, reduced or absent reflexes, and a wide-based unsteady gait; confirmatory tests for polyneuropathy include nerve conduction studies and electromyography, but when patients have only small-fiber neuropathy this may not be detected by conventional nerve conduction studies and a skin biopsy to determine epidermal nerve fiber density may be performed; sweat gland nerve fiber density may also be examined, as well as Congo red staining for amyloid; the modified NIS + 7 scale was specifically designed to assess polyneuropathy impairment in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis and has been the primary endpoint in the 2 landmark trials of TTR silencers for ATTRv neuropathy.

### Differentiating lower motor neuron syndromes [^e0583cfe]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Poliomyelitis and other infections

Poliomyelitis is a rare complication of poliovirus infection characterised by the destruction of the anterior horn cells causing motor weakness. Wild-type polio has largely been eradicated and remains endemic only along the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan.The typical presentation is of acute flaccid paralysis which is asymmetrical and affects the lower limbs more frequently than the upper limbs.Weakness is most prominent in proximal muscle groups. Myalgias and muscle spasm are often prominent prior to onset of weakness. Bulbar and respiratory involvement may occur. PCR of the virus from cerebrospinal fluid is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis. Most affected patients recover strength, although a significant proportion are left with some residual weakness.

Other enteroviruses (including coxsackievirus, echoviruses and enterovirus 71) and the flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus may also cause acute flaccid paralysis due to anterior horn cell disease.

Postpolio syndrome

Postpolio syndrome develops after a period of stability in a proportion of patients who have recovered from acute poliomyelitis. Symptoms may include the development of new weakness and muscle atrophy, fatigue and/or pain.The cause of postpolio syndrome remains unclear and may be due to the degeneration of enlarged reinnervated motor units.

Other LMN syndromes

Although rare, lead and porphyric neuropathies are briefly discussed here, as they are treatable causes of motor neuropathies. Lead toxicity can lead to a subacute motor neuropathy which classically affects the wrist and finger extensors before spreading to other muscles and hence may be confused with MMN.Porphyria, an inherited metabolic disorder of heme biosynthesis, may present with an acute or subacute predominantly motor neuropathy also with focal weakness at onset, such as wristdrop or footdrop. The acute onset may lead to confusion with AMAN. Both lead and porphyric neuropathies are typically associated with involvement of other organ systems and additional features may include gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive disturbance and haematological changes.A family history of symptoms of porphyria or history of occupational exposure to lead may provide clues to the diagnosis. Lead toxicity is treatable with chelation and porphyria with haematin.

### Brain-machine interface in chronic stroke rehabilitation: a controlled study [^2576d62c]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic stroke patients with severe hand weakness respond poorly to rehabilitation efforts. Here, we evaluated efficacy of daily brain-machine interface (BMI) training to increase the hypothesized beneficial effects of physiotherapy alone in patients with severe paresis in a double-blind sham-controlled design proof of concept study.

Methods

Thirty-two chronic stroke patients with severe hand weakness were randomly assigned to 2 matched groups and participated in 17.8 ± 1.4 days of training rewarding desynchronization of ipsilesional oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms with contingent online movements of hand and arm orthoses (experimental group, n = 16). In the control group (sham group, n = 16), movements of the orthoses occurred randomly. Both groups received identical behavioral physiotherapy immediately following BMI training or the control intervention. Upper limb motor function scores, electromyography from arm and hand muscles, placebo-expectancy effects, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level-dependent activity were assessed before and after intervention.

Results

A significant group × time interaction in upper limb (combined hand and modified arm) Fugl-Meyer assessment (cFMA) motor scores was found. cFMA scores improved more in the experimental than in the control group, presenting a significant improvement of cFMA scores (3.41 ± 0.563-point difference, p = 0.018) reflecting a clinically meaningful change from no activity to some in paretic muscles. cFMA improvements in the experimental group correlated with changes in fMRI laterality index and with paretic hand electromyography activity. Placebo-expectancy scores were comparable for both groups.

Interpretation

The addition of BMI training to behaviorally oriented physiotherapy can be used to induce functional improvements in motor function in chronic stroke patients without residual finger movements and may open a new door in stroke neurorehabilitation.

### Microstimulation of human somatosensory cortex evokes task-dependent, spatially patterned responses in motor cortex [^a5d12fdc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Participants

The three participants, part of a multi-site clinical trial (registered on clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01894802), provided informed consent including prior to any experimental procedures. The primary eligibility criterion for the clinical trial was paralysis of at least one hand following spinal cord injury or brain-stem stroke. The primary exclusion criteria were any health concerns that were likely to be exacerbated by surgery or brain stimulation (e.g. chronic pressure sores or a history of seizures). All three participants were male between the ages of 28 and 57 at time of implant and presented with SCI that occurred between 10 and 35 years prior. The primary outcome of the ongoing trial is that the implant is safe for at least 1 year; all enrolled participants have exceeded this goal. The secondary outcome was functional use of the device; assessment of this outcome is still active. The results presented here do not contribute to the assessment of these outcomes. Participant C1 presented with a C4-level ASIA D spinal cord injury (SCI). He had no spared control of the intrinsic or extrinsic muscles of the right hand but retained the ability to move his arm with noted weakness in many upper limb muscles. Filament tests revealed spared deep sensation but diminished light touch in the right hand (detection thresholds ranged from 0.6 to 2.0 g across digit tips). Data were collected 1–1.5 years after implant. Participant P2 presented with a C5 motor/C6 sensory ASIA B SCI. He had no spared control of the intrinsic or extrinsic muscles of the right hand but had limited control of wrist flexion and extension. Proximal limb control at the shoulder was intact, as was elbow flexion. However, he had no voluntary control of elbow extension. He was insensate in the ulnar region of the hand (digits 3–5) on both the palmar and volar surfaces but retained both diminished light touch and deep sensation on the radial side (digits 1–2) (thresholds were 1.4 g to 8 g on the thumb and index, respectively, and 180 g on the middle finger). Data were collected 6.5 years after implant. Participant P3 presented with a C6 ASIA B SCI. He had no functional control of the intrinsic or extrinsic muscles of the right hand but retained the ability to move his arm with noted weakness in many upper limb muscles. He was insensate in the ulnar region of the hand on both the palmar and volar surfaces but retained diminished light touch and deep sensation on the radial side (thresholds were 0.07 g and 1.6 g on the thumb and index and 8 g on the middle finger). Data were collected 1.5–2 years after implant. All participants were compensated for time spent on the study, receiving $1080 per month that the devices were implanted for testing.

### Clinical reasoning: a woman with subacute progression of distal upper extremity weakness [^b68b7bac]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old woman presented with 3 months of progressive hand weakness, initially with distal-predominant symptoms. EMG was notable for diminished amplitudes in bilateral radial nerves without evidence of conduction block and with normal sensory nerve action potentials. Anti-acetylcholine receptor and antistriated muscle antibodies were positive, but subsequent EMG did not reveal abnormalities on repetitive nerve stimulation. Muscle biopsy was performed, revealing extensive inflammatory infiltrates with significant associated fibrosis. This case discusses the approach to localization within the motor pathway and the use of serologic studies, imaging, and electrodiagnostic testing to supplement history and examination.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^3b96a703]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines—C8 radiculopathy clinical presentation: A retrospective case series reviewed a series of 10 patients with C7-T1 herniations in which MRI on each patient revealed a soft disc compressing the C8 nerve root and sensation and DTRs were unremarkable; recovery of hand strength was noted in each patient, although recovery was incomplete in two patients with symptoms greater than four months. This study provides Level IV evidence that C8 radiculopathy usually presents as weakness of the hand and pain radiating to shoulder, scapular area, and to the fourth and fifth fingers; physical exam may reveal normal sensation and DTRs and motor examination may show weakness of finger flexion and extension and weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

### Interictal hemodynamic abnormality during motor activation in sporadic hemiplegic migraine: an explorative study [^d9836d4b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The motor weakness in sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) is a poorly understood aura manifestation. Cortical spreading depression affecting motor excitability and alterations of neurovascular coupling may be integral to the development of migraine aura.

Methods

We studied 10 right-handed SHM patients and 17 healthy controls with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the interictal period. Subjects performed a finger opposition task and had real time determination of oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (deOxyHb) changes. Recordings were completed with 10 left and 10 right sided cortical channels.

Results

Mean baseline to peak changes were significantly reduced in SHM patients as compared to controls bilaterally only for OxyHb measurements in the anteromedial channels. Mean time to peak changes were significant delayed in SHM patients compared to controls bilaterally largely for OxyHb measurements in the posterolateral channels, with the exception of 2 recording channels.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest presence of abnormal interictal hemodynamic responses to increased metabolic demands during motor activation in SHM. These bilateral cerebrovascular changes involve OxyHb to a much larger degree than deOxyHb. Baseline to peak changes were evident more in the anteromedial channels, whereas time to peak changes were more evident in the posterolateral channels. These findings suggest that oxygen inflow into specific brain regions may be defective in SHM as opposed to oxygen utilization. Our findings suggest that in SHM, enduring hemodynamic deficits in response to an impending motor task are evident, which can be further explored in future studies, and possibly therapeutic trials.

### Axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia: there is a HINT [^eb82d306]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical features

The phenotype initially related to mutations in HINT1 encompasses axonal, motor-greater-than-sensory polyneuropathy with an onset mostly in the first decade of life, combined with action neuromyotonia (more pronounced in the hands) and neuromyotonic or myokymic discharges on needle EMG (;;;). The identification of additional patients extended the clinical spectrum; including a later disease onset (up to 28 years of age), asymmetric gait involvement or a pure distal motor neuropathy (dHMN) without neuromyotonia (;).

The initial complaints are distal lower limb weakness with gait impairment, combined with muscle stiffness, fasciculations and cramps in hands and legs, worsened by cold. When specifically asked, most patients report difficulties in releasing grip after a strong voluntary hand contraction, dating back from childhood. The disorder is slowly progressive; none of the reported patients lose ambulation until the sixth decade of life. Upon clinical examination, foot/toe extension and flexion weakness to plegia are present in almost all cases (;;;). Achilles tendon reflexes are diminished to absent, depending on the stage of progression. Upper limbs become involved later in the disease course, usually in the first or second decade. Calf and intrinsic hand and foot muscle wasting is almost always observed to a variable degree (Fig. 2 A–E). The hypotrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles, particularly of the hypothenar and thenar eminence is pronounced, leading to flexion contractures of the fingers, even in cases with mild muscle weakness (Fig. 2 D and E). Mild distal sensory impairment can be present (;;).

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^750cbfbb]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation of C8 radiculopathy at the cervicothoracic junction—case series (C7-T1 herniations): Study design was a case series with the number of patients: 10, in which symptoms included shoulder pain radiating into the lateral aspect of the hand, hand weakness and weakness in finger flexion, finger extension, and intrinsic hand muscles, sensation and DTRs were unremarkable, MRI on each patient revealed a soft disc compressing the C8 nerve, and recovery of hand strength was incomplete in two patients with symptoms greater than four months. The work group concluded that C8 radiculopathy usually presents as weakness of the hand, and pain radiates to the shoulder, scapular area, and to the fourth and fifth fingers; physical exam may reveal normal sensory and DTR's; and motor examination may show weakness of flexors and extensors of the fingers and also weakness of intrinsic muscles of the hand.

### Clinical and electrophysiological examination of pinch strength in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^289e60f9]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The split-hand concept has highlighted the preferential wasting of the thenar side of the hand in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our objective is to re-explore pinch grip strength to assess whether it has the potential to be a practical biomarker of ALS.

Methods

We measured different pinch grip strengths (thumb, index, and fifth) using a pinch gauge from both hands of 54 ALS patients and correlated this with the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, the upper-limb component of the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) score, and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) that comprise the split-hand index.

Results

Pinch grip strength using any of the three fingers showed a positive correlation with its corresponding CMAP, MRC grading, and upper-limb ALSFRS-R score. The thumb pinch showed the strongest correlation with the split-hand index and MRC grading.

Conclusions

Pinch grip strength test using a simple gauge deserves further study as a potentially practical biomarker of ALS.

### Myopathies with finger flexor weakness: not only inclusion-body myositis [^8bf8ca76]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Muscle disorders are characterized by differential involvement of various muscle groups. Among these, weakness predominantly affecting finger flexors is an uncommon pattern, most frequently found in sporadic inclusion-body myositis. This finding is particularly significant when the full range of histopathological findings of inclusion-body myositis is not found on muscle biopsy. Prominent finger flexor weakness, however, is also observed in other myopathies. It occurs commonly in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2. In addition, individual reports and small case series have documented finger flexor weakness in sarcoid and amyloid myopathy, and in inherited myopathies caused by ACTA1, CRYAB, DMD, DYSF, FLNC, GAA, GNE, HNRNPDL, LAMA2, MYH7, and VCP mutations. Therefore, the finding of finger flexor weakness requires consideration of clinical, myopathological, genetic, electrodiagnostic, and sometimes muscle imaging findings to establish a diagnosis.

### Differentiating lower motor neuron syndromes [^41205e38]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic immune-mediated neuropathies

MMN typically presents with asymmetrical distal weakness and wasting, without sensory impairment which is slowly progressive and has an upper limb predilection(figure 2). Weakness may be out of proportion to muscle wasting and involvement of wrist and/or finger extension at onset should prompt consideration of MMN as a potential diagnosis. Positive features such as twitching, cramping and spasm are relatively common in MMN and may be the presenting symptom.Bulbar and respiratory involvement are not typical, although respiratory symptoms may occur due to phrenic nerve involvement.

Figure 2 
Asymmetric wasting of thenar eminence in a 71-year-old male with an upper limb predominant motor neuropathy associated with anti-GM1 IgM antibody (A). High doses of intravenous immunoglobulin were required to achieve disease stabilisation. The CMAP was unrecordable on the right from APB. The distal APB CMAP on the left was normal, but there was marked dispersion and reduction in CMAP amplitude with stimulation at the elbow (B). A, amplitude; A, area; APB, abductor pollicis brevis; d, duration; CMAP, compound muscle action potential; CV, conduction velocity; NCS, nerve conduction studies.

A definitive diagnosis of MMN requires demonstration of focal motor conduction block on neurophysiological studies with normal sensory nerve conduction across the region of block.As conduction block may be difficult to demonstrate and may occur in proximal segments, comprehensive neurophysiology should be performed and proximal stimulation may be required. A normal compound muscle action potential amplitude in a weak muscle with neurogenic recruitment on EMG suggests the presence of conduction block. Anti-GM1 IgM is present in ∼50% of cases with a high titre supporting a diagnosis of MMN.MRI may reveal asymmetrical nerve enlargement and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images of the brachial plexus.Ultrasound imaging may show multiple sites of peripheral nerve enlargement in the arms, including segments without conduction abnormalities.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the accepted treatment for MMN.Dosing must be individualised and no optimal dosing strategy has been established, although high doses of IVIg are often required.Furthermore, despite treatment, MMN is often associated with progressive axonal loss and functional decline.

### Do longer necks predispose to hirayama disease? A comparison with mimics and controls [^b1b9260c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dynamic changes in cervical spine during flexion is a proposed mechanism for Hirayama disease [HD], a localized form of anterior horn cell disorder. Apparent shortening of dura as compared to vertebral column leading to dural shift on flexion is considered to be the primary mechanism in this hypothesis. Whether this disproportion is a result of short dura or longer cervical segment is not known and neck length has not been studied in HD. Also, all patients with segmental motor weakness and wasting of upper limbs do not show dural changes; hence comparative evaluation of HD and its mimics is important.

Material and Methods

Patients with segmental wasting and weakness limited to upper limbs were subjected to flexion MRI. A special pillow was designed to provide fixed flexion angle of 35°. Patients showing dural changes formed the HD group while rest formed the non-HD group [mimics]. Both groups were analyzed on clinical, electrophysiological and radiological parameters. Whole spine to neck ratio of patients in HD group was compared to the non-HD group and age matched controls.

Results and Conclusions

Patients with HD had longer cervical segments as compared to the non-HD group and age matched controls [p=0.001]. The longer cervical segment, in combination with dural changes probably contributes to the pathophysiology of dynamic flexion hypothesis of HD and the onset around the growth spurt. Patients with HD had cold paresis and finger extensors were consistently weaker than flexors. Apart from longer necks, cold paresis and pattern of weakness may help to differentiate HD from its mimics.

### Apparent weakness of ulnar-innervated muscles in radial palsy [^de6dacc5]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Muscle strength was assessed in 11 patients with radial or posterior interosseus palsy. Apparent weakness was found in the dorsal and palmar interossei and the abductor digiti minimi. These muscles insert on the extensor expansions, and their activation is associated with concomitant contraction of finger flexors and extensors. This apparent weakness may be due to their unopposed traction on the extensor expansion by the paralyzed extensor digitorum.

### A practical guide to assessing functional motor weakness: a review of validated techniques [^ae893b56]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological symptom disorder, specifically, functional limb weakness, is a commonly seen condition in clinical neurological practice and requires careful examination for diagnosis. Specific and detailed examination techniques have been developed and validated over the past 100 years to help clinicians differentiate functional limb weakness from objective neurological weakness. These techniques vary in sensitivity, specificity, clinical application, and limitations. However, over time, the studied and/or validated forms of these exam techniques may have been lost and often not performed or taught in the way it was originally studied, thus decreasing the reliability of the examiner’s findings. With many new examination techniques for functional limb weakness having been studied in recent years, it is important to not only review the form of each of these examination techniques, but also discuss the clinical applications, limitations, and utility of each. To date, there has been no comprehensive review demonstrating the exact form of all the studied and/or validated examination techniques for functional limb weakness and their proposed clinical utility. This review analyzes 9 examination techniques for functional limb weakness that have been studied for validity and provides readers with the exact technique of examination used to study each. It also outlines their sensitivity, specificity, clinical applications, and limitations to help clinicians accurately diagnose functional limb weakness.

### Clinical reasoning: a 39-year-old man with asymmetric distal weakness and loss of sensitivity [^52d9f00e]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 39-year-old man presented with an asymmetric distal weakness and loss of sensitivity sequentially affecting both lower extremities and the left upper limb. Nerve conduction studies showed a multifocal sensory and motor axonal neuropathy, and a pseudo-conduction block of the right fibular nerve, the whole being consistent with a mononeuropathy multiplex. An uncommon etiology was found after an extensive workup. Axonal loss was severe, with only partial response to treatment with corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulins.

### Altered hemodynamic responses in patients after subcortical stroke measured by functional MRI [^a8e8b22b]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) is a promising method for defining brain recovery after stroke quantitatively. Applications thus far have assumed that the BOLD hemodynamic response in patients after stroke is identical to that in healthy controls. However, because of local vascular compromise or more diffuse vascular disease predisposing to infarction, this assumption may not be justified after stroke. We sought to test whether patients who have suffered a lacunar stroke show BOLD fMRI response characteristics identical to those of healthy controls.

Methods

We measured the BOLD fMRI signal time course in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand with finger- or hand-tapping tasks for minimally or mildly impaired right-handed patients (n=12) after lacunar strokes causing limb weakness and for healthy controls (n=20).

Results

With a right-handed sequential finger-tapping task, the rate of rise and maximum increase of the BOLD signal in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex were > 30% lower (P< or =0.01) in the stroke patients. Similar relative decreases were found for the same task performed with the left hand. These changes were found in patients both in the hemisphere affected by stroke and in the unaffected hemisphere, suggesting that the BOLD fMRI time course differences observed arise from a diffuse functional pathology. The difference between patients and controls is not a result of age alone, since differences were not found between the younger (n=10; aged 22 to 38 years) and the older (n=10; aged 56 to 83 years) healthy controls. The effect also does not seem to be dependent on the specific hand movement task used.

Conclusions

The magnitude of the BOLD fMRI response can be reduced in stroke patients even if infarcts do not involve the cortex. This may be a consequence of the stroke, but the observation that the BOLD signal time course is similar in the affected and unaffected hemispheres suggests that it also could result from preexisting pathophysiological changes in the cerebral microvasculature.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^9cc0fa93]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Whereas the signs and symptoms of ulnar nerve dysfunction are straightforward to detect at the bedside, identifying the site, severity, and aetiology of the condition is more challenging. Neurological examination of the limbs and cranial nerves should be documented at the earliest opportunity in a patient suspected of having PUN. Routine screening of patients for evidence of PUN in the recovery room should not be undertaken.Sensory findings in PUN may include paraesthesia, numbness, pain, and loss of two-point discrimination in the ring and little finger.

Broad differential diagnoses to consider in such cases are muscle diseases, radiculopathy, myelopathy, spinal cord trauma/infarction, and stroke.A brachial plexus lesion arising from compression on a cervical rib is a further differential diagnosis to consider. A pre-existing abnormality along the course of a peripheral nerve, for example an area of nerve compression, may increase the likelihood that a further physically distinct insult will manifest with signs of symptoms of nerve injury. This is known as the ‘double-crush’ phenomenon.A history of pre-existing neurological symptoms in the upper limb should, therefore, be sought. New, acute postoperative pain or paralysis should trigger assessment for compartment syndrome or acute vascular compromise.Communication to the patient of examination findings, possible diagnoses, and further assessment should be undertaken by the relevant anaesthetist and must be documented in the medical record.When notified that a patient has developed PUN (which may come to the attention of anaesthetists months or even years after anaesthesia), practitioners should express their sympathy and offer any assistance to patients. In UK practice, offering an apology when something goes wrong does not mean admitting legal liability and does not automatically mean taking personal responsibility for preceding events. Such communication should be copied to the patient's general practitioner/family doctor. It is imperative that the anaesthetist or surgical team or both ensure a responsible physician is involved in the patient's care until either PUN symptoms resolve or treatment or oversight of long-term dysfunction is established.

### Focal myopathy mimicking posterior interosseous nerve syndrome [^b63bcf95]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man developed weakness of extension of the right index, middle, and fourth fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints, over 2 years. No sensory deficit was present. Nerve conduction studies, including the right radial nerve, were within normal limits. Needle electromyographic (EMG) examination showed myopathic changes that were limited to the right extensor digitorum communis and extensor indicis proprius muscles. An intravenous edrophonium chloride test had no effect on weakness and repetitive stimulation showed no significant decremental response. An EMG-guided open biopsy of the extensor digitorum communis muscle revealed severe myopathic changes. Evaluation for the cause of myopathic involvement was negative. After 13 months, clinical examination and electrophysiological studies showed no significant progression. This case exemplifies the fact that a focal myopathy may mimic an entrapment neuropathy.

### Can compressive thoracic cord lesions cause a pure lower motor neurone syndrome? [^becb2e40]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A pure lower motor neurone syndrome affecting the upper limbs due to degenerative cervical spine disease is well described (cervical spondylotic amyotrophy); however, the existence of a similar syndrome affecting the lower limbs and due to thoracolumbar spinal cord compression is controversial.

Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy is characterised by weakness and wasting of the upper limbs without sensory or lower limb involvement. It can be further classified depending on the muscles involved into a proximal (scapular, deltoid and biceps) and a distal type (triceps forearm and hand). Radiologically, the proximal subtype corresponds to lesions at the C4/5 intervertebral level resulting in damage to anterior horn cells supplying C5/6 nerve root innervated muscles. The distal subtype corresponds to cord lesions at either C5/6 or C6/7 that affect anterior horn cells innervating C7–T1 nerve root innervated muscles.These anatomical correlations help explain the pathomechanism of disease for the two cases reported in which the cord lesion is at T11/12 but the muscles affected are innervated by nerve roots L2–S1.

### Combined central and peripheral demyelination in two siblings, immune mediated or genetic? [^b145bcb9]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Having excluded other clinically relevant secondary causes of demyelination (online supplemental table 2A,B), she was managed as having chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 1 month following symptom onset. Despite her vision improving to near normal over the following weeks, her tetraparesis improved only minimally over the subsequent 8 months while maintained on azathioprine 150 mg daily and oral corticosteroids. She was therefore started on mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g two times a day at 12 months and improved over the subsequent year, such that she could walk with support, hold objects and feed herself. Approximately 2 years into her illness (figure 1) she relapsed, with tetraparesis and visual loss, having defaulted treatment for the 6 months before. Examination confirmed, poor visual acuity (right eye: nil light perception, left eye: counting fingers), bilateral optic atrophy, paraplegia in the lower limbs, MRC grade 1–2 strength in the upper limbs, and markedly impaired joint-position sense, light touch and pin prick up to the knees in the lower limbs and elbows in the upper limbs. MR scan of the brain (figure 2) confirmed central demyelination. An MR scan of the spine was not done. She continued to deteriorate despite a repeat course of IVIG and intravenous methylprednisone. She died from respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic weakness arising from a phrenic nerve neuropathy, while awaiting an intensive care unit bed for ventilatory support. Postmortem histology confirmed demyelination of the cerebral white matter and peripheral nerves (figure 3).

Clinical summaries

Patient 1–1 is the first child born full term to healthy, non-consanguineous parents (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Early development was normal. She underwent a right inguinal herniorrhaphy at 18 months. At 14 years, she presented with a 6-month history of difficulty holding a pen and fine motor difficulties in the right hand. Her left hand function was normal. She denied difficulty in walking, climbing stairs or rising from a squatting position. The initial physical exam was remarkable for distal right upper extremity weakness, along with wasting of the thenar and hypothenar eminences and interossei bilaterally. She had difficulty opposing her thumb to the 4th and 5th fingers, but handgrip was good. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) revealed signs of focal demyelination in the right upper extremity (Supplementary Table 2). Needle electromyography (EMG) was not performed.

### Variation in repeated handgrip strength testing indicates submaximal force production in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome [^0671fc1e]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Changes in handgrip strength have recently been adapted as clinical biomarkers for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) under the assumption of a disease-specific peripheral neuromuscular dysfunction. However, some have proposed that strength impairments in ME/CFS are better explained by alterations in higher-order motor control. In serial measurements, exertion can been assessed through analysis of variation, since maximal voluntary contractions exhibit lower coefficients of variation (CV) than submaximal contractions.

Methods

Serial handgrip strength measurements of 105 ME/CFS patients and 66 healthy controls from a previously published biomarker validation study are analyzed post hoc regarding their CV. CV is separately compared in a subsample of participant with normal indexes of fatigability.

Results

Compared to healthy controls, patients had significantly higher CV, largely over the conservative 15% cutoff associated with submaximal exertion. In the subsample of study participants, whose within-session fatigability was within normal bounds, CV was still significantly higher in female patients; the difference in male patients was not statistically significant (p=0.06).

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that loss of grip strength is likely compounded by alterations in higher-order motor control, challenging its utility as a biomarker of peripheral dysfunction. Functional weakness is discussed within a framework that sees motor fatigue as a result of reduced implicit self-efficacy acquired in the context of chronic dyshomoeostasis and disability.

### A practical guide to assessing functional motor weakness: a review of validated techniques [^74f0ec3c]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation and limitations

In the baseline assessment, both patients with FLW and ONW should exert less oppositional abductive force on the examiner’s hand in the affected LE compared to the unaffected LE, or no abductive force at all.

Test 1 is considered positive if the affected (midline) LE exerts more abductive force on the examiner’s hand than when performed during the prior baseline assessment.

Test 2 is considered positive if the unaffected (midline) LE exerts less abductive force on the examiner’s hand than when performed during the prior baseline assessment.

This sign was validated in only one study of 33 participants (16 FLW and 17 ONW) with either weakness of one LE or bilateral unequal weakness. The study reported both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in detecting FLW. However, it's important to note that the study was conducted with unblinded examiners, and no data were collected on inter-rater reliability. The reliability of the abduction sign can be confounded by pain or difficulty following commands or keeping attention.

### Thumb abduction strength measurement in carpal tunnel syndrome [^53e01351]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The strength of thumb abduction and index finger flexion was measured with a load cell mounted on a custom-made device. The resulting ratio (thumb-index ratio, or TIR) was used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and was compared with the gold standard (electrodiagnostic studies). The ratio was used as an internal control in each subject.

Methods

Sixty-one patients (80 hands) with a clinically and electrodiagnostically confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic CTS and a control group of 51 asymptomatic volunteers (102 hands) were evaluated. The strength of thumb abduction and index finger flexion was measured in standardized fashion in each hand three times, and the mean was taken to calculate TIR.

Results

Thumb-index ratio was statistically significant in differentiating between a CTS patient and a normal control. A TIR of 0.51 had a 98% specificity and a 92% positive predictive value for diagnosing CTS. Thumb-index ratio greater than 0.51 was neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosis of CTS. Twenty-four (30%) hands in the investigational group had a TIR < or =0.51 compared with 1 hand (1%) in the control group. There was a significant difference in the TIR between hands with a motor amplitude of < or =4.0 mV and those with an amplitude >4.0 mV.

Conclusions

Most patients with CTS do not appear to have notable weakness of thumb abduction strength. A TIR < or =0.51 had high specificity for differentiating between CTS and controls. However, the performance of this device needs to be evaluated in a general population of patients who present with signs and symptoms of CTS before it would be clinically applicable.

### T1-T2 disk herniation presenting with horner syndrome: a case report with literary review [^98158477]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Historically, symptomatic thoracic disk herniation occurred with a frequency of 2 to 3/1,000 cases of disk herniation.This is likely even less frequent with the advent of MRI use in diagnosis. Patients with upper extremity radicular pain/paresthesias are often sent for radiographs and MRI. Cervical radiographs are not usually clinically useful because of the difficulty in visualizing through the shoulders. The T1-T2 interspace is not fully visualized on a cervical MRI; therefore, a thoracic MRI scan can be helpful. CT can be used to complement MRI in cases of thoracic disk herniations. This study can distinguish calcified disk herniations, which may lead to modified treatment strategies and surgical approach.The T1 nerve root supplies the ulnar nerve with C8 at a root level, the medial pectoral, medial brachial cutaneous, the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves at a cord level, and the first intercostal nerve. Delineating the location of nerve compression begins with assessing sites of peripheral compression with physical examination. Tests such as Tinel sign at carpal/cubital tunnel, elbow flexion test, ulnar nerve compression test, Phalen test, and/or Durkan test are helpful. Causes of T1 nerve root compression has been summarized in the literature (Table 2). C8 and T1 nerve roots compromise both the ulnar and median nerve root; therefore, precise examination of these roots is necessary. Dermatomal patterns for C8 and T1 radiculopathy can be difficult to discern on examination because they can mimic peripheral nerve pathology such as cubital and/or Guyon tunnel syndrome.Motor deficits of C8 compression are reflected as weakness in hand intrinsic muscles, finger flexion, and some finger abduction. Weakness with finger abduction results from C8 radiculopathy and/or peripheral ulnar nerve entrapment. The C8 nerve root innervates the extensor indicus and abductor pollicis brevis from the radial and median nerves, respectively, in addition to finger flexion (ulnar nerve). C8 root pathology will result in weakness in all three of these muscles with manual muscle testing. T1 motor root innervates the flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor pollicis longus, flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus, lumbricals, interossei, and the pectoralis major.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^dc304d27]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical disc herniation (CDH)—accuracy of clinical localization: A retrospective observational study of 100 patients with a single compressed cervical nerve root correlated clinical and surgical findings; arm pain corresponded to the compression site in 23% of cases, forearm pain or paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 32% and 66%, respectively, and hand pain and paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 70% and 27%, respectively. With diminution of DTR, the lesion was correctly localized to a single level or one of two levels in 11% and 82%, respectively; objective muscle weakness corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 77% and 12%, respectively; sensory loss corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 65% and 35%, respectively; and in all cases with C5 or C8 radiculopathy accompanied by weakness, the level was correctly localized. This study provides Level II evidence that clinical findings related to the fingers are the most accurate for localizing a CDH to a single level, and that a single level CDH may produce signs and symptoms that correspond to overlapping dermatomal levels.

### Genotype / phenotype correlations in AARS-related neuropathy in a cohort of patients from the United Kingdom and Ireland [^593d4e59]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Patients

Due to overlapping and variable clinical phenotypes the referrals were occasionally misleading indicating CMT1, hereditary sensory neuropathy or intermediate CMT phenotypes. Multi-gene panel testing was performed in a total of 22 patients with ‘mixed/intermediate’ CMT and out of the 8 positives 5 were proved to be an AARS mutation.

Lower limb predominant sensorimotor neuropathy was characteristic in UK family 1. All family members developed pes cavus and foot drop bilaterally leading to progressive walking difficulties at different adult ages. They all remained ambulant with orthotic support. Various degree of upper limb involvement was observed. The proband manifested with fluctuating weakness of finger and intrinsic hand muscles at disease onset with progressive hand muscles wasting at later stage.

Slowly progressive various degree of motor weakness affecting the lower extremities and subsequent walking problems were the leading symptoms in UK family 2. Tiptoe walking and feet deformities were present. Sensory changes were mild or absent and no upper limb involvement was associated, but we note that the index patient is only 20 years of age.

In UK family 3, the clinical presentation was very heterogeneous. The proband manifested with young adult onset asymmetric upper and lower limb involvement equally affecting motor and sensory functions. His father had stable feet deformities since childhood which progressed rapidly in his late 50s exclusively and symmetrically affecting his lower limbs causing predominantly motor and milder sensory loss. Development of bilateral foot drop and walking difficulties were common symptoms within the family.

A slowly progressive disease course and predominant lower limb motor loss was the common presentation in UK family 4. Initial symptoms presented either in symmetric or asymmetric fashion and striking clinical features were bilateral foot and toe drop with subsequent walking difficulties. Various degrees of weakness and wasting of intrinsic hand muscles with split hand formation were associated. Mild to moderate sensory changes were present.

Lower limb motor symptoms progressed slowly in Irish family 1 leading to different impact on their walking abilities with ambulatory loss in some family members. Sensory loss in lower extremities accompanied and upper limb involvement manifested in later ages.

### Wrist drop and muscle weakness of the fingers induced by an upper cervical spine anomaly [^c7bcc642]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

This report presents a case of wrist drop and muscle weakness of the fingers as a false localizing sign induced by stenosis of the upper cervical spine caused by a bony anomaly.

Methods

A 77-year-old male complained of severe muscle weakness of the right hand. Cervical spine MRI showed a severe and sharp compression of the spinal cord from the dorsal side between C2 and C3 with intramedullary intensity changes and mild stenosis at C3/4 and C4/5.

Results

The patient underwent laminectomy of C2, cranial side laminotomy of C3, and laminectomy of C4. Decompression of the spinal cord was demonstrated 1 year after surgery. The patient achieved full recovery of the muscle weakness 1 year after undergoing surgery.

Conclusions

The pathophysiology of false localizing signs remains controversial; however, we believe that this unusual compression pattern and level had the possibility to induce atypical myelopathies such as drop hand and finger of the unilateral hand in this case.

### Hierarchical motor control in mammals and machines [^8e1e447c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The settings in which higher-level structures are most relevant depend upon the specific behaviors for which the animal is adapted. For example, dogs and cats do not execute dexterous finger movements, whereas non-human primates, humans, and even rodents do. And increasingly for animals that reach and exhibit dexterous finger control, direct cortical control of upper-limb extremities allows closer integration of visual and tactile information for hand-eye (and finger) coordination. To support sensory-guided fine motor control, which is required for dexterous manipulation, non-human primates and humans have more substantial direct projections from cortex to spine,. The anatomical variation continues even among primates, with fine motor control by humans even surpassing other primates. More broadly, the general role for high-level structures in mediating sensory-rich control may be relevant in other niches; for example, legged traversal of precarious terrains, as performed by a mountain goat navigating small footholds, is also obviously dependent upon visual guidance for foot placement.

Recent studies involving targeted inactivation or removal of motor cortex provide evidence that supports this view that cortex refines movement, primarily in contexts involving precise sensory-guided control or dynamic motor improvisation. In rodents, the production of grasping behaviors has been localized to the rostral forelimb area (RFA), and long-duration intracortical microstimulation can generate reaching and grasping behaviors(paralleling similar results in monkeys). Experimenters have demonstrated that transient, reversible, and specific deficits in pellet-grasping ability are produced in behaving rats when RFA is silenced via cooling. In other experiments, rodents traversed a simple “obstacle course” with infrequent dynamic perturbations. Although rodents with bilateral motor cortical lesions showed no significant deficits in navigating stable terrains, in the presence of dynamic perturbations, lesioned animals were unable to rapidly adapt their movements. The sensory-guided element of motor cortical control was perhaps most directly tested in experiments making use of a virtual environment that allows for the experimental dissociation of motor control and sensory feedback—researchers found that in response to experimental perturbations of the visual environment, the local cortical microcircuit in motor cortex was involved in producing corrective motor responses to situations where the actual sensory consequences did not match predictions. Taken together, motor cortex appears required for fine-scale, dexterous motor control, especially involving sensory guidance, but motor cortex may not be required for stereotyped (autonomous and amortized) movements, consistent with previous interpretations,.

### Intrinsic hand muscle function, part 1: creating a functional grasp [^58bfc759]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Regaining hand function has been identified as the highest priority for persons with tetraplegia. In many patients, finger flexion can be restored with a tendon transfer of extensor carpi radialis longus to flexor digitorum profundus (FDP). In the absence of intrinsic function, this results in a roll-up finger movement, which tends to push large objects out of grasp. To enable patients to grasp objects of varying sizes, a functional grasp is required that has a larger excursion of fingertip-to-palm distance than can be supplied without intrinsic function. The aim of this study was to quantify the role of intrinsic muscle force in creating a functional grasp.

Methods

Finger kinematics during grasp were measured on 5 cadaveric hands. To simulate finger flexion, the FDP was activated by a motor and intrinsic muscles were loaded at various levels (0, 125, 250, 375, or 500 g). Finger movement was characterized by the order of metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joint flexion and by the maximal fingertip-to-palm distance during finger closure.

Results

Without any intrinsic muscle contribution (0-g load), FDP activation resulted in flexion of all 3 joints, whereby flexion began at the proximal interphalangeal joint, followed by the distal interphalangeal joint, and then the metacarpophalangeal joint. With increasing intrinsic muscle load, finger flexion was initiated at the metacarpophalangeal joint, followed by the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. This altered joint flexion order resulted in a larger maximal fingertip-to-palm distance during finger flexion. The difference between the 2 extreme conditions (0 g vs 500 g of intrinsic muscle load) was 19 mm.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that simultaneous activation of the FDP and the intrinsic muscles results in an apparently more functional hand closing compared with FDP activation alone because of altered kinematics and larger fingertip-to-palm distances.

Clinical Relevance

These findings suggest that intrinsic muscle balancing during reconstruction of grasp in tetraplegic patients may improve function.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^efa19a6f]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

3 IMPAIRMENT AND FUNCTION ASSESSMENT

PwNMDs known to involve the hand should be assessed at regular intervals, evaluating and monitoring stability and changes in symptoms, signs and function expected for their diagnosis. Interestingly, measures of hand motor impairment such as strength have been demonstrated to correlate poorly with activity limitations, potentially attributable to compensatory strategies and that strength is but one factor in hand function.This underscores the importance of a whole‐person “holistic” approach to assessment, selecting the appropriate tools and measures to capture performance, QOL, and pwNMDs' priorities.

Neuromusculoskeletal history, physical exam, and outcome measures should be documented at each visit for monitoring, informing care, and supporting advocacy needs. If a pwNMD presents with atypical features, or more rapid than expected neurological deterioration, concomitant or superimposed diagnoses should be considered. For example, comorbid pathologies such as entrapment neuropathies, radiculopathy, neurotoxic exposures, or endocrinopathies such as diabetes and thyroid disorders, should be investigated and treated as appropriate.Carpal tunnel syndrome affects 3%–6% of adults, with prevalence much higher across CMT subtypes (as high as 31%). For clinicians and electrodiagnostic medicine specialists, diagnosis of CTS can be challenging in inherited neuropathies as there is a significant overlap in symptoms between both conditions, electrodiagnostic criteria are less reliable due to demyelination and axonal loss, median and ulnar sensory nerve action potentials are often absent and are preferentially involved vs. radial. A minority of patients are also known to have baseline asymmetry of CMT disease.A Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire Symptoms Severity Score ≥20 may be used as a high sensitivity, moderate specificity threshold to guide CTS diagnosis in patients with inherited neuropathy. In their retrospective study of 309 patients, Panosyan et al.also identified a higher risk of CTS in CMT patients with comorbidities of RA, wrist fracture, renal disease with dialysis, osteoarthritis (OA) of the wrist, and collagen vascular disease. Both splints and surgical decompression have been found to be effective treatments in CMT1A.In patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, there have been case reports and small series suggesting benefit from CTS surgical release, especially in those who reported activity‐provoked symptoms including nocturnal awakening. Nerve enlargement by ultrasound at the carpal tunnel has not been successful in predicting surgical outcomes and nerves are diffusely enlarged in CMT1A.Diabetes is also known to worsen motor and sensory impairment in CMT1A.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^7920d26e]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Persons with DM1 require regular monitoring for cardiac and metabolic disease, which confer additional risk of polyneuropathy and stroke.As pwDM1 can have variable central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including developmental disabilities, which can potentially complicate the neurological presentation, careful evaluation of all factors is necessary.While IBM affects an older cohort, with greater likelihood of common conditions of aging such as spinal arthropathy or stroke, IBM is also associated with a higher rate of polyneuropathy, Sjögren's syndrome, and T‐cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.Therefore, it is important not to assume that all symptoms, signs, and functional decline are a result of the neuromuscular condition.

An excellent detailed approach to functional assessment of the hand and wrist was described by Kimmerle illustrating several key points.Firstly, basic Physical factors of ROM, strength, sensation, pain, myotonia, and swelling should be evaluated; in particular, hand intrinsics, long finger flexor and extensor muscles, resting upper limb posture, active and passive wrist flexion, extension, supination, pronation, MCP, and IP ROM, and strength. Psychological factors may impact function, such as developmental/perceptual and cognitive limitations, motivation, and self‐perception or body image relating to hand use. Hand roles identify how each hand may be used in bimanual or unimanual tasks. Object‐related hand and body actions refers to specific movements used for reaching, grasping, and manipulating such as stabilization and movement of the trunk, types of power and pinch grasps (Figure 2). Finally, Task parameters include characteristics of the object such as size, shape, texture, and performance demands such as force, endurance, speed, and physical environment that may directly affect ADLs, work, or leisure function. This model is useful to guide selection of specific treatment targets and appropriate outcome measures for objective monitoring by clinicians. Even in cases of severe impairments, pwNMD have often been observed to demonstrate remarkable ability to adapt with their own unique long‐standing compensatory strategies. Ultimately, the practical ability to accomplish a task will determine if a rehabilitation recommendation is accepted or rejected by a pwNMD.

### SIgMAR1 mutation associated with autosomal recessive silver-like syndrome [^fa1caf7f]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

At age 17 years, on neurologic examination, he had clawed hands with no fixed contractures, bilateral finger and foot drop, knee bobbing, marked muscle atrophy from mid-forearms and knees down (figure, B), and weakness of wrist extension (Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 2/5 right, 4/5 left), finger extension (1/5), intrinsic hand muscles (0/5), ankle dorsiflexion (0/5 right, 1/5 left), ankle plantar flexion (1/5), toe extension (1/5), and toe flexion (0/5). Muscle strength in proximal muscles and finger flexors was normal. There was marked spasticity of the lower limbs and normal muscle tone in the upper limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were present in the upper limbs, increased at the knees, and absent at the ankles. Babinski sign was present bilaterally. Sensory and cranial nerve examinations were unremarkable. He walked with a combination of spastic and steppage gait. There was no scoliosis. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with a motor axonal neuropathy that was more severe in the lower limbs (table e-1). The superficial peroneal sensory action potential was normal and although the sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude was mildly reduced this may have been due to previous surgery rather than a sensory neuropathy. EMG of the biceps brachii showed features of chronic denervation. Brain and spinal cord MRIs were normal. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score v.2 was 13.

At age 20, neurologic examination confirmed progression of wrist extension weakness (MRC grade 1/5) causing hand drop and weakness of finger flexion (4/5) (video). The remainder of the examination was unchanged. MRI of the lower limbs demonstrated normal appearance of the thigh muscles and atrophy of all lower leg muscles with mild fatty replacement (figure, C). Serum creatine kinase level was normal at 184 IU/L.

### Insights into phenotypic variability caused by GARS1 pathogenic variants [^330aa3a6]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

GARS1 ‐associated neuropathy encompasses different phenotypes including purely motor distal forms (dHMN or dSMA type V), sensory and motor distal forms (CMT2D), and severe iSMA‐like phenotypes with respiratory failure. A continuum exists between dHMN and CMT2D phenotypes, even in individuals from the same family, with some of the members displaying sensory alterations whereas others do not. Weakness and atrophy usually appear and predominate in the hands, progressing to the distal muscles of lower limbs in approximately half of the individuals, with variable clinical severity that ranges from weakness and atrophy of the extensor digitorum brevis and dorsiflexors of the fingers, to weakness and peroneal muscle atrophy with foot drop and pes cavus. Patients classified as CMT2 also present a distal sensory axonopathy that is associated with an impairment of all sensory modalities with vibratory and tactile predominance, related to disease severity but not duration.

The c.794C>T (p.Ser265Phe) variant in GARS1 was previously described in a Korean family in which three patients were affected by a dHMN type V phenotype. The clinical phenotype of this Korean family is quite similar to those described in our families, with an age at onset around the 2nd decade of life, a purely or predominantly motor presentation, and relevant upper limb involvement. As patent in our families, predominant upper limb weakness and atrophy have been described as an initial or early clinical feature related to GARS1 neuropathy. In most of the reported cases, symptoms first appear in the intrinsic hand muscles, predominantly in the thenar musculature and first interosseus. The preferential involvement of the first dorsal interosseous and the abductor pollicis brevis muscles, with relative sparing of the abductor digiti minimi muscle, is known as split hand. This clinical sign was described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where >70% present a split hand at some stage of the disease. In any case, split hand is not pathognomonic for ALS, although it has only rarely been described in other diseases like spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease), spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, and postpolio syndrome, and in a single dHMN family with a pathogenic variant in GARS1. In our patients, upper limb involvement predominated in 10 of 12 affected members, and clinical examination revealed a split hand in nine of them (75%), confirming that GARS1 ‐associated neuropathy should be considered a potential cause for split hand.

Case 15: Prolonged COVID-Incident Multifocal Motor Neuropathy

CMAP = compound motor action potential; D = day; EDX = electrodiagnostic testing; IVIg = IV immunoglobulin therapy; MMN = multifocal motor neuropathy; SNAP = sensory nerve action potential. Three weeks after 12/04/1920 onset of mild COVID-19, this previously healthy 65-year-old developed progressive R > L hand weakness and atrophy. Three months later, he could not hold eating utensils or a pen and noted hand “limpness” tingling and pain, and finger cramps without lower limb symptoms. Neurosurgical referral prompted cervical MRI showing unrelated degenerative changes. A local neurologist's EDX suggesting MMN or lower motor neuron disease prompted our neuromuscular evaluation on post-COVID D67. This revealed weakness in the distal ulnar and median nerve distributions, 4/5 finger abduction strength, and R > L interosseus and thenar eminence atrophy. He could not make a fist or hold utensils; sensory self-examination was normal. EDX on D122 documented demyelinating neuropathy with conduction blocks in both ulnar nerves at the forearms and across the elbows and prolonged latencies and reduced conduction in both median nerves. F waves were prolonged in the upper and lower limbs, and the right peroneal CMAP was low amplitude. SNAP velocities were normal, with slightly diminished amplitude in the median, ulnar, and sural nerves. Serum immunoglobulins and immunofixation were normal, and GM1 antibodies were absent. He met the diagnostic criteria for MMN and began standard treatment, IVIg 2 g/kg/4 weeks, on D146. A few weeks later, he noticed improved hand dexterity with ability to fully open hands and use utensils and decreased hand cramps, with 90% improvement after the 3rd cycle. Then, expiration of IVIg orders caused regression. After 2 missed cycles, D292 evaluation documented R > L increasing difficulty opening his hands and return of hand and forearm tingling. He self-reported hair loss on legs, muscle difficulties, skin color changes, tingling, itching, and needing to move legs for comfort (eFigure 1,). Same-dose IVIg was restarted, and after 2 cycles with improvement, clinic return on D341 documented 80% improved weakness, hand opening, finger dexterity, and hand cramps. He had bilateral 4/5 finger abduction strength, and this image documented significant remaining R > L interossei muscle atrophy. IVIg was continued, and he was referred for interosseus exercises.

Case Presentations

Case 1

A 60-year-old woman comorbid with controlled hypertension, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and alopecia had a baseline multiyear history of nondisabling neck and low back pain for which she would periodically see a chiropractor. Shortly after a clinically successful treatment for neck pain relief she noted new symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness, and poor balance with a tendency to drag the right leg that progressed over 1 month to her wall-walking in the home, inability to navigate stairs, and using a walker outside the home.

She self-referred to her local emergency room where a history of numbness and tingling in the hands with loss of fine motor control bringing difficulty in toothbrushing and dressing was elicited. Radiographs and CT scan showed diffuse degenerative change without deformity, and she was referred to the local amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinic.

At the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinic, physical examination found bilateral positive Hoffmann sign and bilateral clonus. A cervical spine MRI confirmed spondylotic cord compression (Figure 1) and prompted referral to a spine surgeon.

Figure 1 
Case 1; Preoperative MRI.

A spine surgeon found her American Spine Injuries Association motor index score to be 96 with the only deficiency being weakness in right hip flexion where there was a history of arthritis pain. She was admitted and booked on the urgent inpatient surgery list for anterior cervical decompression and fusion C4-C7.

Postoperatively, there was no change in her neurological status whatsoever. At reassessment, a consultant confirmed generally good strength and the American Spine Injuries Association score but found she could not perform rapid digital opposition to all the lesser fingers and was able to correctly report only three of 10 trials in passive elevation/depression of the great toes. The clinical diagnosis was PCS. On POD#6, MRI was repeated (Figure 2), confirming that posterior compression of the cord remained unchanged despite some decompression anteriorly.

Figure 2 
Case 1; MRI after primary anterior surgery.

The patient was returned to the operating room for multilevel cervical laminectomy C4-7.

After the second surgery, there was immediate major relief of neurological symptoms and improved manual dexterity and mobility. Baseline deficits were such that the patient required convalescent transfer to her local hospital. Outpatient Spinal Cord Rehabilitation facilitated her eventual discharge home with stable gait and functional independence.

Materials and methods

Patient characteristics

We enrolled ten patients with MMN, ten patients with ALS and ten healthy controls at the neuromuscular outpatient clinic of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, a tertiary referral centre for neuromuscular disorders. Patients with MMN and ALS fulfilled diagnostic consensus criteria for definite or probable MMN and the El Escorial criteria for ALS, respectively. All patients with ALS had clinical signs of lower motor neuron involvement (i.e. weakness, atrophy and/or fasciculations) in the forearm or hand. Patients and healthy controls were matched for age and gender. All patients with MMN were on immunoglobulin maintenance treatment and all patients with ALS used riluzole. All patients and healthy controls underwent a standardized clinical examination including muscle strength testing of the wrist, thumb and finger flexion, opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, finger spreading and adductor pollicis, together with sensory testing. Clinical examinations, electromyogram and MRI studies were performed on the same day. The local institutional review board approved this study and we obtained written informed consent from each subject prior to inclusion.

Nerve conduction study protocol

Nerve conduction studies were performed using a Nicolet VIKING IV electromyogram machine (CareFusion, Tokyo, Japan) after the limbs were warmed in water at 37 °C for 30 min. One of us (SG) was unaware of the clinical diagnosis and performed nerve conduction studies using a shortened version of a previously published protocol, consisting of motor nerve stimulation of the median nerve (recording m. abductor pollicis brevis) and ulnar nerve (recording m. abductor digiti V) on both sides up to the axilla. We used the definition of conduction block as described in the diagnostic consensus criteria for MMN. Axonal loss was defined as a decrease of distal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) below to 2 standard deviations of the lower limit of normal, i.e. a CMAP <3.5 mV for the median nerve and a distal CMAP of <2.8 mV for the ulnar nerve.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^3e099d2b]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Resting wrist‐hand orthoses (Figure 3B) are often a mainstay of contracture prevention and management. They aim to maintain the hand in a functional or “intrinsic plus” position, with the wrist neutral or slightly extended, MCPs flexed, and IPs extended, to prevent clawing.Recommendations on wear vary; many advise at least every other night,but some state minimally five times a week is required to be effective.A study on teenagers with DMD who previously demonstrated contracture progression reported maintenance, and even improvement, over 8 months with nighttime orthoses (alternating sides each night); benefit, however, was only maintained long‐term in patients who continued utilization.

Various orthoses assist function. Wrist extension supports (Figure 3C,D) can improve grip strength,and functional reach.Thumb opposition and tripod pinch strength are fundamental aspects of manual dexterity,and can be aided by positioning orthoses such as thumb opponens (“spica”) splints or spacers (Figure 3E,F).Finger orthoses stabilize hypermobile IP joints for fine movements (Figure 3G).Some hand orthoses are designed to reduce clawing by limiting MCP hyperextension (Figure 3H).Many of these aspects can be combined into a single device.

Dynamic arm supports can be attached to a power wheelchair or stand to help move the limb in a gravity‐eliminated plane. Such support can improve endurance and independence for activities such as feeding,and personal hygiene. However, the devices can be expensive, cumbersome, interfere with wheelchair control,and disease progression may prevent long‐term use,necessitating careful evaluation before prescription. For some individuals with ataxia, weighted items and cuffs may be beneficial during activities such as writing or eating, but may also contribute to increased fatigue; evidence is equivocal.Finally, orthoses can support the use of other assistive devices,such as universal cuffs (Figure 3I).

Despite their usefulness, compliance with orthotic devices is often low.Collaboration with experienced occupational therapists and orthotists is essential, as setting clear goals and expectations, and optimizing fit, comfort, weight, ease‐of use, and proactive troubleshooting can facilitate adherence.

### Supinator to posterior interosseous nerve transfer for recovery of hand opening in the tetraplegic patient: a case series [^6da5e432]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

There are 18 000 new traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) cases in the United States annually; these result in profound disability. Half of the SCIs occur in the cervical cord, resulting in tetraplegia.Restoration of upper-extremity function is of highest priority to the SCI population as it can dramatically enhance independence.Finger extension is a critical component of hand function, providing adequate hand aperture to acquire an object and subsequently release the same object. This function dramatically enhances patients' ability to use utensils and operate hand-held devices such as cell phones. Midcervical injuries typically result in loss of hand function while preserving shoulder and elbow flexion functions, with variable control of forearm muscles. Tendon transfers are an established surgical technique to restore hand function and represent the alternative to nerve transfers for achieving finger extension. However, the tendon transfer options for finger extension, including tenodesis of the finger extensors to the dorsum of the radius, are suboptimal.Even the active tendon transfers, such as pronator teres to the extensor digitorum communis (EDC), often provide inadequate hand opening. Many such patients still depend on dropping the wrist into flexion to pull the fingers open (tenodesis). Transfer of the radial nerve (RN) branches innervating the supinator (SUP) muscle to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) offers the potential for full active extension of the fingers without using additional wrist positioning, with far less postoperative care.

### Management of ulnar nerve injuries [^9e982615]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Injuries to the ulnar nerve result in both sensory and motor deficits within the hand. Functional outcomes following repair of this nerve have not performed as well as outcomes following repair of the median or radial nerves. Advances in imaging modalities may provide earlier means of identifying and diagnosing closed nerve injuries. Early neurorrhaphy of acute nerve injuries provides the best outcome, but consideration should also be given to performing distal motor nerve transfers to preserve hand intrinsic motor function when injuries occur at or above the proximal forearm. This article attempts to summarize the most recent trends within ulnar nerve repair.

### Distal median to ulnar nerve transfers to restore ulnar motor and sensory function within the hand: technical nuances [^4df2e6c9]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

ULNAR NERVE INJURIES can be severely debilitating and result in weakness of wrist flexion, loss of hand intrinsic function, and ulnar-sided hand anesthesia. When these injuries produce a Sunderland fourth- or fifth-degree injury, surgical intervention is necessary for functional recovery. Traditional methods for restoring hand intrinsic function after ulnar nerve palsy include interposition nerve grafting for timely presentations or tendon transfers for either complex injuries or late presentations. Distal median to ulnar nerve transfer to restore ulnar intrinsic nerve muscle function was first performed in 1991. We continue to find it advantageous for recovery of ulnar intrinsic function in patients with proximal ulnar nerve injuries by significantly reducing denervation time and directing motor fibers into this critical motor distribution. Several case reports have been published discussing the concept behind this approach, but none have outlined the specific steps involved in this operation. As such, this article discusses our operative methodology behind the distal median to ulnar neurotization, which includes a Guyon canal release, identification of donor median and recipient ulnar nerve fascicular anatomy within the forearm, and an operative tutorial on proper technique for neurotization to restore both ulnar motor and sensory function. We present the technical nuances of the following nerve transfers to restore ulnar nerve function within the hand: anterior interosseous nerve to deep motor branch of ulnar nerve, third webspace sensory contribution of median nerve to volar sensory component of ulnar nerve, and end-to-side reinnervation of ulnar dorsal cutaneous to the remaining median sensory trunk.

### Muscle weakness in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^96ffa385]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the prevalence of muscle weakness in the general population is uncertain, it occurs in about 5% of U.S. adults 60 years and older. Determining the cause of muscle weakness can be challenging. True muscle weakness must first be differentiated from subjective fatigue or pain-related motor impairment with normal motor strength. Muscle weakness should then be graded objectively using a formal tool such as the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale. The differential diagnosis of true muscle weakness is extensive, including neurologic, rheumatologic, endocrine, genetic, medication- or toxin-related, and infectious etiologies. A stepwise approach to narrowing this differential diagnosis relies on the history and physical examination combined with knowledge of the potential etiologies. Frailty and sarcopenia are clinical syndromes occurring in older people that can present with generalized weakness. Asymmetric weakness is more common in neurologic conditions, whereas pain is more common in neuropathies or radiculopathies. Identifying abnormal findings, such as Chvostek sign, Babinski reflex, hoarse voice, and muscle atrophy, will narrow the possible diagnoses. Laboratory testing, including electrolyte, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and creatine kinase measurements, may also be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated if there is concern for acute neurologic conditions, such as stroke or cauda equina syndrome, and may also guide muscle biopsy. Electromyography is indicated when certain diagnoses are being considered, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, neuropathy, and radiculopathy, and may also guide biopsy. If the etiology remains unclear, specialist consultation or muscle biopsy may be necessary to reach a diagnosis.

### Label: KLONOPIN-clonazepam tablet (...) [^44fbd2dc]. FDA (DailyMed) (2011). Low credibility.

A taming effect in aggressive primates, muscle weakness and hypnosis are also produced. In humans, clonazepam is capable of suppressing the spike and wave discharge in absence seizures and decreasing the frequency, amplitude, duration and spread of discharge in minor motor seizures. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 74% of patients receiving clonazepam 1 mg/day were free of full panic attacks, compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients. Seizure Disorders Klonopin is useful alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, akinetic and myoclonic seizures. In patients with absence seizures who have failed to respond to succinimides, Klonopin may be useful.

In some studies, up to 30% of patients have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy. sweating; trembling or shaking; sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; feeling of choking; chest pain or discomfort; nausea or abdominal distress; feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; derealization or depersonalization; fear of losing control; fear of dying; paresthesias; chills or hot flushes. Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance Since Klonopin produces CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.

They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during Klonopin therapy. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27, 863 AED-treated patients was 0. 43% compared to
0. 24% among 16, 029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated.

There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age in the clinical trials analyzed.

### Frequently asked questions (...) [^6e11bf93]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Acute flaccid myelitis is an uncommon but serious neurologic condition.
- Sudden onset of arm or leg weakness, loss of muscle tone, and loss of reflexes are the most common symptoms.
- Get answers to frequently asked questions about acute flaccid myelitis. What can I do if I suspect acute flaccid myelitis. Seek medical care immediately if you or your child develop any of these symptoms: weakness or loss of muscle tone or reflexes in the arms or legs, facial droop or weakness, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, difficulty with swallowing, or slurred speech. If a doctor suspects someone has AFM, they should be hospitalized immediately. AFM can worsen rapidly and weaken the muscles used for breathing. The patient might need extra support to help them breathe. How is AFM different from polio.

Poliomyelitis is the term used to describe the syndrome of acute flaccid limb weakness and lesions in the grey matter of the spinal cord. Poliomyelitis caused by poliovirus, or polio, rarely occurs in the United States. In 2014, the term AFM was adopted to describe poliomyelitis without a known cause and not caused by poliovirus. AFM has some similarities with polio, such as the lesions in the grey matter of the spinal cord and flaccid limb weakness that can result in paralysis. Polio can be prevented by a vaccine. Stool specimens that we receive from AFM patients are tested for poliovirus. If poliovirus is detected, it is considered a case of polio, not a case of AFM. We continue to test all specimens from AFM patients to look for viruses, including poliovirus and non-polio enteroviruses. Is there a link between vaccinations and AFM. We have found no evidence to suggest that vaccinations cause AFM.

In 2018, AFM occurred in children who had received vaccines, and also in children who had received no vaccines. Among the AFM patients reviewed in 2018, about 85% had no recorded vaccinations in the 30 days prior to the beginning of their limb weakness. We continue to review the medical history of all reported patients, including past vaccinations, as part of our work. Has anyone died from AFM. Two patients with confirmed AFM died soon after developing AFM, one in 2017 and one in 2020. We have also learned of deaths in cases confirmed in previous years. CDC is gathering information on deaths reported to us from health departments. We are also gathering information as part of our patient outcome data collection. We ask that health departments send information about every death of a person with AFM to CDC. Why was there no outbreak of AFM in 2020. There have been increases in AFM cases in 2014, 2016, and 2018 across the U. S.

Because of this, we anticipated an increase in AFM cases in 2020, but it did not happen. It is likely that prevention measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as social distancing, mask wearing, and increased hand washing, reduced the circulation of enteroviruses that can cause AFM. We saw a decrease in other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza, during 2020 as well. It is unclear if we will see another increase in AFM cases and we continue to monitor and evaluate all reported AFM cases closely as part of national surveillance. How are AFM cases reported to CDC. AFM is not nationally notifiable, but all jurisdictions have some type of requirement for clinicians to report patients under investigation for AFM based on surveillance case definitions, which are developed by CDC and CSTE.

### Abduction finger sign: a new sign to detect unilateral functional paralysis of the upper limb [^34c5b4b0]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective of this study is testing a new sign to differentiate functional from organic paralysis of the arm. Thirty-six healthy subjects, ten patients with acute functional paralysis of one arm and eleven patients with acute organic paralysis of one arm were enrolled. The test consisted of abduction finger movements of one hand against resistance with a maximal sustained contraction to detect synkinetic abduction finger movements of the contralateral hand. For both hands, contralateral hand synkinesias were observed in healthy subjects. The task performed with the unaffected hand evoked synkinesias of the presumed affected hand in functional patients, but did not evoke synkinesias of the affected hand in organic patients. The abduction finger test had 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing functional from organic paralysis of the upper limb in this cohort of patients. The abduction finger sign may be a reliable bedside test to discriminate functional from organic arm paralysis.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^f85439fe]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Consider degenerative cervical myelopathy in patients over 50 with progressive neurological symptoms, such as pain and stiffness in the neck or limbs, imbalance, numbness, loss of dexterity, frequent falls, and/or incontinence
Perform a full neurological assessment as early symptoms are subtle and non-specific
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is essential to detect degenerative changes in the cervical spine and cord compression
Time is Spine: Refer patients with suspected DCM promptly to a specialist for consideration of spinal surgery, as delayed diagnosis can lead to residual symptoms and functional disability

A 54 year old man presents with neck stiffness for about a year. He complains of numbness in his fingers and difficulty buttoning up his shirt, which has not improved following surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. Of late, he has experienced unsteadiness and has started to use a walking stick after sustaining falls. He sees a neurologist who identifies hyperreflexia in his arms and legs. An MRI scan shows multilevel cervical spondylosis and disc herniation causing cord compression. He is diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy and referred to spinal surgery for operative decompression.

### Dynamometry of intrinsic hand muscles in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [^2b68f55c]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Several problems are associated with manual muscle testing and dynamometry in the hands of patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of the Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer (RIHM) to directly measure intrinsic hand muscle strength in CMT disease.

Methods

We measured hand muscle strength and hand function in 41 patients with CMT disease.

Results

RIHM measurement of intrinsic strength had excellent reliability. We found overlapping RIHM strength values in Medical Research Council grades 3 to 5. High grip and pinch strength could be found in patients with severe intrinsic muscle weakness. RIHM measurements were more strongly correlated with fine motor skills of the hand than grip and pinch strength.

Conclusions

The Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer is a reliable instrument to measure intrinsic hand muscles strength in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, providing more detailed information than manual muscle testing and a more direct assessment of intrinsic muscle loss than grip and pinch dynamometers.

### Differential diagnosis of vacuolar myopathies in the NGS era [^fa82adf4]. Brain Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Three patients (P18, P23 and P28) showed focal myofibrillar breakdown combined with autophagic vacuoles and prominent accumulations of abnormal mitochondria often containing multiple paracrystalline inclusions. No pathogenic variants were found using WES in any of these cases. In P18, this was surprising because he is member of a large family with an autosomal dominant trait including six additional affected family members in three generations. The index patient had distinct high‐grade paresis of finger extension, whereas leg weakness developed at a much later stage. One of his brothers had been wheelchair bound at the age of 40 and had died at 58 years of an undiagnosed muscle disease. Other affected family members had difficulty in maintaining an erect posture, which correlated with fatty degeneration of spinal muscles on radiological imaging. In the biopsy of P23, nemaline bodies were found repeatedly, albeit not as frequent as usually seen in sporadic late‐onset nemaline myopathy (SLONM) (78). In addition, muscle weakness was only slowly progressive in this case; there was no rapid progression leading to respiratory weakness within 1–5 years after onset or axial weakness or dysphagia which is often encountered in SLONM cases (78).

### Nicotine patch for the treatment of pain associated with... [^098d1b5d]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Nicotine Patch for the Treatment of Pain Associated with Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy This phase II trial investigates how well short-term nicotine patch works in treating pain that is associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Some chemotherapies and other drugs used to treat cancer can damage nerves that are around the body and outside of the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral nerves carry sensations to the brain and control the movement of our arms and legs. They also control the bladder and bowel. When this happens, it is called chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a set of symptoms that include pain, burning, tingling, weakness, and loss of feeling or numbness. These symptoms may start in the hands and feet and may move to other parts of the body. CIPN can cause severe pain and can make it difficult to do activities of everyday life.

If it gets very bad, it can cause more serious problems like changes in heart rate and blood pressure, dangerous falls, trouble breathing, or loss of muscle function. Nicotine has some pain reducing properties and may be able to help lessen symptoms of CIPN. The purpose of this study is to test whether nicotine, in the form of a nicotine patch that is placed on the skin, can lessen the symptoms of CIPN. Inclusion Criteria

### Reduction of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy with glutamine [^dfe38fe1]. Clinical Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dose-limiting toxicity of many newer chemotherapeutic agents is peripheral neuropathy. Prior attempts to reduce this side effect have been unsuccessful. We report on the possible successful reduction of peripheral neuropathy with glutamine administration after high-dose paclitaxel.

Experimental Design

Patients entered a high-dose chemotherapy protocol in which the first high-dose cycle was paclitaxel at 825 mg/m(2) given over 24 h. The first cohort of patients did not receive glutamine, and the second cohort of patients received glutamine at 10 g orally three times a day for 4 days starting 24 h after completion of paclitaxel. Neurological assessment was performed at baseline, and at least 2 weeks after paclitaxel, and consisted of a complete neurological exam and nerve conduction studies.

Results

There were paired pre- and post-paclitaxel evaluations on 33 patients who did not receive glutamine and 12 patients who did. The median interval between pre- and post-exams was 32 days. For patients who received glutamine, there was a statistically significant reduction in the severity of peripheral neuropathy as measured by development of moderate to severe dysesthesias and numbness in the fingers and toes (P < 0.05). The degree and incidence of motor weakness was reduced (56 versus 25%; P = 0.04) as well as deterioration in gait (85 versus 45%; P = 0.016) and interference with activities of daily living (85 versus 27%; P = 0.001). Moderate to severe paresthesias in the fingers and toes were also reduced (55 versus 42% and 64 versus 50%, respectively), although this value was not statistically significant. All of these toxicities were reversible over time.

Conclusions

Glutamine may reduce the severity of peripheral neuropathy associated with high-dose paclitaxel; however, results from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials will be needed to fully assess its impact, if any. Trials are currently ongoing to assess its efficacy for standard-dose paclitaxel in breast cancer and other tumors for which peripheral neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity.

### Leprous ganglionitis and myelitis [^9f1834ef]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Case report.

A 27-year-old Brazilian woman presented with a 7-month history of progressive pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness of the left upper limb, and paroxysmal dysesthesia affecting the left foot. On examination, there were erythematous, anesthetic patches of skin overlying the metacarpophalangeal joints and on the palmar surfaces of the hands (figure e-1 at). There was congenital, bilateral campylodactyly and new flexion deformity of the fingers of the left hand with an incomplete range of passive extension. The intrinsic muscles of the left hand were wasted, particularly the thenar eminence and the dorsal interossei. Fasciculations were not observed. There was marked tenderness in the antecubital fossa and at the wrist, and the left superficial radial nerve was palpable. There was severe weakness of intrinsic finger movements, wrist flexion, and extension. Left upper limb reflexes were brisk and painful to percuss but tone, power, and reflexes including plantar responses were otherwise normal. Sensation to pinprick was reduced throughout the left hand with loss of temperature, vibration, and proprioceptive sensation distal to the wrist.

### Prevention of axonal loss after immediate dosage titration of immunoglobulin in multifocal motor neuropathy [^f896d6fc]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The association between electrophysiological parameters and concurrent muscle strength in 39 MMN patients was evaluated in a cross‐sectional study from 2003 in which an association between a reduced distal CMAP amplitude and an increased risk of corresponding muscle weakness was observed. The same group subsequently published a report in 2006 on 20 MMN patients in whom the presence of axonal loss determined by muscle EMG was the strongest indicator of corresponding muscle weakness. Similar observations have been reported in 2007. In all of these cross‐sectional studies, the outcome parameter of muscle weakness was examined manually and then categorized as either present or absent, resulting in less precision. We like to emphasize that dynamometry yields continuous and precise measures of strength, thereby reducing the need for the number of patients included in clinical studies. Therefore, it is advantageous to consider the use of dynamometry during the planning in studies of small patient groups, such as MMN. Other study limitations should be considered, including the following. (i) Assessment of isokinetic strength in our study was associated with axonal loss of the corresponding nerve, but in MMN there is an irregular nerve involvement on a fascicular level, leading to a less relevant evaluation of strength not accurately reflecting the nerve involvement. The weakness of minor findings by the IKS score is that they do not necessarily reflect an impairment noticed by the patient or a clinically meaningful change. However, if such changes occur in conjunction with dose adjustments or a gradual worsening is observed on consecutive evaluations, then the IKS might well promote timely management in MMN. (ii) A minor fraction of the muscles involved at wrist flexion are innervated by the ulnar rather than the median nerve. (iii) The MMN‐RODS is designed to be utilized following conversion of the raw scores into Rasch‐transformed scores, as the untransformed MMN‐RODS performs suboptimally compared to the clinical findings. (iv) Determination of the CMAP amplitude as a measure of axonal loss is disputed, as both distal conduction blocks and collateral sprouting can influence the amplitude. We decided to use this parameter because it gives a continuous variable and because the observed axonal loss was in accordance with our findings on EMG and motor unit number estimation. All the abovementioned limitations are of minor significance compared with the major consideration of the limited numbers of long‐term‐treated patients with this rare disorder. This questions the generalization of our findings but does not take away the immediate challenge of what is a sufficient treatment dose of IgG in MMN.

### Prior to repair functional deficits in above-and below-elbow ulnar nerve injury [^bf24d771]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical deficits might vary, depending on whether an ulnar nerve lesion is above or below the elbow. Lack of strength and clawing are common manifestations of ulnar nerve paralysis. However, the magnitude of strength deficit relating to different pinch patterns and the rate and range of proximal interphalangeal extension deficits are poorly described.

Methods

I prospectively evaluated 14 patients with above-elbow and 16 with below-elbow unrepaired ulnar nerve injuries. The completeness of flexion of the ring and little fingers was tested at the metacarpophalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. Proximal interphalangeal joint extension lag of the ring and little fingers was assessed by goniometry, and adduction and abduction of the little finger. With dynamometers, I bilaterally evaluated grasp, key pinch, and pinch-to-zoom strength. Hand sensibility was evaluated with monofilaments.

Results

Metacarpophalangeal flexion in the ulnar fingers was absent in all patients, whereas distal interphalangeal joint flexion was preserved in 29 of 30 patients. In above-elbow ulnar nerve injuries, there was no paralysis of the flexor digitorum profundus. One-third of patients exhibited no clawing. There were minimal differences between the rate of clawing and proximal interphalangeal extension lag in above- and below-elbow ulnar nerve lesions, or its occurrence in the ring or little finger. In relation to the normal hand, grasping, key pinch, and pinch-to-zoom decreased by 62%, 51%, and 75% compared with 59%, 61%, and 76% in below- and above-elbow injuries groups, respectively. In both groups, sensory deficits were predominantly over the little finger and ulnar side of the hand.

Conclusions

Minimal differences were observed in clinical deficits after above- and below-elbow ulnar nerve injuries. Hand weakness was the most frequent problem, whereas pinch-to-zoom strength was highly affected.
