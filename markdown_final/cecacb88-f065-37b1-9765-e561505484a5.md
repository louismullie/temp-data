## Question

Why are OAT's results clinically important for managing stable patients 3–28 days after MI with a persistently occluded infarct-related artery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) results are clinically important for managing stable patients 3–28 days after myocardial infarction (MI) who have a persistently occluded infarct-related artery (IRA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the specific patient population OAT enrolled. Then, I should verify the trial design and primary outcomes. Next, I will examine the main results and their statistical interpretation. After that, I need to check subgroup analyses and mechanistic substudies. Then, I should review how guidelines incorporated OAT and how practice changed. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications and address common counterarguments, making sure I cite the pivotal sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and population. OAT enrolled stable patients 3–28 days after MI with a totally occluded IRA and at least one high-risk feature (ejection fraction < 50% or proximal occlusion), while excluding those with ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or multivessel disease requiring bypass, which precisely targets the scenario of a stable post-MI patient with a chronic total occlusion and no active ischemia [^40ffac14] [^48a6cfd5].

> I need to verify the trial design and interventions. OAT was a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial comparing PCI with stenting plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) versus OMT alone, with a primary composite endpoint of death, reinfarction, or hospitalization for NYHA class IV heart failure, and a mean follow-up of approximately 3 years in the initial report, with later extended follow-up to about 6 years, which gives robust long-term outcome data [^40ffac14] [^3b70c264].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the primary results. There was no significant difference in the primary composite endpoint at 4 years (17.2% PCI vs 15.6% medical therapy; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.92–1.45), and extended follow-up confirmed no reduction in death, reinfarction, or class IV heart failure with PCI, establishing that routine PCI of a totally occluded IRA in stable, asymptomatic patients does not improve hard outcomes [^40ffac14] [^3b70c264].

> Wait, let me verify the safety signals, because procedural harm can offset benefit. There was a trend toward more reinfarction in the PCI arm (7.0% vs 5.3%; HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.92–2.00), largely driven by periprocedural and stent thrombosis events, which is a critical safety concern that tempers any hypothetical advantage of restoring patency late after MI [^40ffac14] [^86592f1e].

> I should double-check whether any subgroup showed benefit. Analyses by ejection fraction, age, sex, infarct artery location (including LAD), and renal function consistently showed no interaction and no outcome advantage for PCI, including in the highest-risk strata, reinforcing that the neutral result is generalizable across clinically relevant subgroups [^92e11e41] [^8cb616c9] [^85f59f7d] [^aa0b6d24] [^55e061a6].

> Next, I should review mechanistic substudies to ensure there isn't a physiologic rationale being missed. TOSCA-2 showed PCI achieved high patency at 1 year but no improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction versus OMT, and the OAT-EP electrophysiology substudy found no reduction in arrhythmic vulnerability markers with PCI, while the nuclear viability ancillary study showed no attenuation of adverse remodeling even in patients with preserved infarct-zone viability, arguing against a hidden remodeling benefit in this setting [^82ef65c0] [^f16d6eb1] [^91a0d7f7].

> Let me consider symptom relief and quality of life, because clinicians often cite angina improvement. Early follow-up showed a modest reduction in angina with PCI that attenuated by 3 years and was not accompanied by sustained quality-of-life gains, and economic analysis found higher costs and no quality-adjusted survival advantage for PCI, which undermines a symptom-driven rationale for routine PCI in asymptomatic patients [^747efb81] [^51330c50].

> I should confirm how guidelines translated this evidence. Contemporary ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines issue a Class 3 "no benefit" recommendation against routine PCI of a totally occluded IRA in stable, asymptomatic patients more than 24 hours after MI without ongoing ischemia, and ESC guidance aligns with this stance, reflecting that OAT definitively tested and refuted the late open-artery hypothesis in this population [^372c3fa5] [^da32112a] [^dc120b53].

> But wait, what if practice changed anyway; I need to check real-world impact. Observational analyses of U.S. practice showed only modest declines in PCI for total occlusions after OAT and guideline updates, indicating persistent overuse despite negative randomized evidence, which highlights the gap between evidence and practice and underscores the importance of OAT for appropriateness criteria [^4c4e91ca].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. OAT is pivotal because it provides high-quality, randomized evidence that in stable, asymptomatic patients 3–28 days post-MI with a totally occluded IRA, routine PCI does not reduce death, reinfarction, or heart failure and may increase reinfarction risk, while offering no durable symptom or quality-of-life advantage; therefore, management should prioritize OMT and reserve PCI for patients with ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or other guideline-directed indications rather than for routine late opening of occluded IRAs [^40ffac14] [^3b70c264] [^372c3fa5].

> Hold on, I should verify common counterarguments. Some cite smaller studies or meta-analyses suggesting improved ejection fraction with late PCI, but these signals did not translate into clinical benefit in OAT and TOSCA-2, and any EF gains appear offset by procedural risks and lack of outcome improvement; thus, the totality of randomized evidence supports a conservative approach in this exact scenario [^77de4546] [^82ef65c0] [^40ffac14].

> In conclusion, OAT's results are clinically important because they definitively overturned the late open-artery hypothesis for stable, asymptomatic post-MI patients with a totally occluded IRA, establishing that routine PCI does not improve survival or major adverse cardiovascular outcomes and may cause harm, and thereby reshaped guideline recommendations and appropriateness criteria for millions of patients in this common post-MI phenotype [^40ffac14] [^3b70c264] [^372c3fa5].

OAT's results are clinically important because they show that routine PCI of a persistently occluded infarct-related artery in stable patients 3–28 days after MI **does not reduce death, reinfarction, or heart failure** compared with optimal medical therapy alone [^40ffac14] [^3b70c264]. PCI provided only a transient, early improvement in angina that **dissipated by 3 years**, with no sustained quality-of-life benefit [^747efb81] [^51330c50] and higher costs [^747efb81]. Importantly, PCI was associated with a **trend toward more reinfarction**, largely due to stent thrombosis and reocclusion [^86592f1e]. These findings led to guideline recommendations against routine PCI in this setting [^372c3fa5] [^da32112a], emphasizing medical therapy and selective revascularization only for ongoing ischemia or high-risk features [^c5e24bbd].

## Clinical outcomes and implications

### Primary and secondary endpoints

- **Primary endpoint**: No significant difference in death, reinfarction, or NYHA class IV heart failure at 4 years (17.2% PCI vs 15.6% medical therapy; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.92–1.45) [^40ffac14].
- **Secondary endpoints**: No significant differences in individual components (death, reinfarction, or heart failure) or in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over long-term follow-up [^3b70c264].
- **Reinfarction**: Trend toward higher reinfarction with PCI (7.0% vs 5.3%; HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.92–2.00), driven by stent thrombosis and reocclusion [^86592f1e].

---

### Symptom relief and quality of life

Early angina relief was modest at 4 months (7% more angina-free with PCI) but **diminished by 3 years** (1% difference, not significant) [^51330c50]. Quality of life showed a small, transient improvement at 4 months that **did not persist** at 1–2 years [^747efb81].

---

### Economic considerations

Costs were approximately **$7,000 higher** with PCI over 2 years, with no quality-adjusted survival advantage [^747efb81].

---

## Subgroup analyses and confounding factors

- **Ejection fraction**: No benefit of PCI regardless of baseline EF, including in patients with EF ≤ 44% [^8cb616c9].
- **Infarct artery location**: No benefit specific to LAD occlusion or proximal lesions [^766d93f1].
- **Renal function**: No benefit in patients with renal impairment [^55e061a6].
- **Collateral flow**: Presence of collaterals did not modify the lack of PCI benefit [^9cee7f50].

---

## Mechanistic insights

- **Microvascular dysfunction**: Late PCI often fails to restore microvascular flow, limiting functional recovery [^03e04263].
- **Stent thrombosis**: Increased reinfarction risk from stent thrombosis and reocclusion offsets patency gains [^86592f1e].
- **Remodeling**: PCI did not attenuate adverse LV remodeling or improve EF in viability-selected subgroups [^91a0d7f7].

---

## Guideline impact and clinical practice

Guideline recommendations: ACC/AHA/SCAI give a **Class 3 (no benefit)** recommendation against routine PCI of a totally occluded IRA in stable patients > 24 hours post-MI without ongoing ischemia [^372c3fa5] [^da32112a]. Practice patterns: Despite guidelines, PCI for occlusions > 24 hours post-MI remains common, underscoring the need to align practice with evidence [^4c4e91ca].

---

## Clinical management implications

- **Optimal medical therapy**: Emphasize guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) with close follow-up [^notfound].
- **Selective revascularization**: Reserve PCI for patients with ongoing ischemia, high-risk features, or symptoms despite GDMT [^c5e24bbd].
- **Patient selection**: Use stress testing or FFR to identify ischemia-driven candidates for revascularization [^f49a7a7d].

---

OAT's results are clinically important because they demonstrate that routine PCI of a persistently occluded IRA in stable patients 3–28 days post-MI **does not improve survival or reduce major adverse events** compared with optimal medical therapy alone [^40ffac14] [^3b70c264]. PCI offers only transient symptom relief, carries higher costs, and may increase reinfarction risk, leading to guideline recommendations against routine PCI in this setting [^747efb81] [^372c3fa5].

### Design and methodology of the occluded artery trial (OAT) [^48a6cfd5]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that late opening of an infarct-related artery (IRA) after myocardial infarction (MI) could improve clinical outcome. However, the suggestive observational data are limited by selection biases. Indeed, most small randomized studies have not demonstrated benefit. Thus, there is no recommendation for routine late opening of the IRA in current national guidelines for management of stable post-MI patients. The OAT is designed to test the hypothesis that opening a totally occluded IRA 3 to 28 days after MI in high-risk asymptomatic patients will improve clinical outcome and be cost-effective. The primary end point is the first occurrence of recurrent MI, hospitalization/treatment of New York Heart Association class IV congestive heart failure, or death. Trial background, design, and preliminary baseline characteristics of 2027 randomized patients are presented. Eligible patients are randomly assigned in equal proportions to optimal evidence-based medical care or optimal care plus late opening of the IRA using percutaneous coronary intervention of the occluded IRA. Treatment groups will be compared using intent-to-treat analysis. The results of OAT should have broad clinical impact by defining an evidence-based approach to the asymptomatic, high-risk, post-MI patient with an occluded IRA. If the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention are established, then a policy of routinely seeking and opening persistently occluded IRAs could be advocated. If not, this strategy should be avoided in this large subgroup of post-MI patients.

### Coronary intervention for persistent occlusion after myocardial infarction [^40ffac14]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study OAT was published by Hochman JS and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the OAT study, the trial question was: what is the role of PCI in stable patients with occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3–28 days after myocardial infarction? In the OAT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the OAT study, the population was: 2166 patients (476 female, 1690 male). The inclusion criteria were stable patients who had total occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction and who met a high-risk criterion (an ejection fraction of < 50% or proximal occlusion). The key exclusion criteria were NYHA class III or IV HF, shock, a serum creatinine concentration > 2.5 mg/dL, angiographically significant left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease, angina at rest, and severe ischemia on stress testing. In the OAT study, the interventions were: n = 1082 PCI (stent and optimal medical therapy) n = 1084 medical therapy (conventional medical therapy alone). In the OAT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, myocardial infarction, or NYHA class IV HF at 4 years (17.2% vs. 15.6%; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.45). In the OAT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in myocardial infarction, both fatal and nonfatal (7% vs. 5.3%; HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.92 to 2) No significant difference in nonfatal reinfarction (6.9% vs. 5%; HR 1.44, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.16). In the OAT study, the conclusion was: in stable patients who had total occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction and who MET a high-risk criterion (an ejection fraction of < 50% or proximal occlusion), PCI was not superior to medical therapy with respect to death, myocardial infarction, or NYHA class IV HF at 4 years.

### Predictors of outcome and the lack of effect of percutaneous coronary intervention across the risk strata in patients with persistent total occlusion after myocardial infarction: results from the OAT (occluded artery trial) study [^92e11e41]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine predictors of outcome and examine the influence of baseline risk on therapeutic impact of late mechanical opening of a persistently occluded infarct related artery after myocardial infarction in stable patients.

Background

Previous studies in patients with acute coronary syndromes suggest that the impact of infarct-related artery recanalization on clinical outcome is greatest in patients at highest risk.

Methods

Of 2,201 patients (age 58.6 ± 11.0 years) with infarct-related artery occlusion on days 3 to 28 after myocardial infarction in the OAT (Occluded Artery Trial) study, 1,101 were assigned to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 1,100 to medical therapy alone and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. The primary end point was a composite of death, reinfarction, or New York Heart Association functional class IV heart failure. Interaction of treatment effect with tertiles of predicted survival were examined using the Cox survival model.

Results

The 5-year rate for the primary end point was 18.9% versus 16.1% for patients assigned to PCI and medical treatment alone, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92 to 1.43, p 0.23). Lack of benefit of PCI was consistent across the risk spectrum for both the primary end point and total mortality, including for the highest tertile (33.9% PCI vs. 27.3% medical treatment alone, HR: 1.27, 99% CI: 0.87 to 1.85 primary end point and 23.5% PCI vs. 21.7% medical treatment alone, HR: 1.16, 99% CI: 0.73 to 1.85 mortality). The independent predictors of the composite outcome were history of heart failure (HR: 2.06, p < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (HR: 1.93, p 0.001), diabetes (HR: 1.49, p 0.002), rales (HR: 1.88, p < 0.001), decreasing ejection fraction (HR: 1.48 per 10%, p < 0.001), decreasing days from myocardial infarction to randomization (HR: 1.04 per day, p < 0.001), and decreasing glomerular filtration rate (HR: 1.11 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m², p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In the OAT study, there was no variation in the effect of PCI on clinical outcomes at different levels of patient risk, including the subset with very high event rates. (Occluded Artery Trial [OAT]; NCT00004562)

### Long-term effects of percutaneous coronary intervention of the totally occluded infarct-related artery in the subacute phase after myocardial infarction [^3b70c264]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite observations suggesting a benefit for late opening of totally occluded infarct-related arteries after myocardial infarction, the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) demonstrated no reduction in the composite of death, reinfarction, and class IV heart failure over a 2.9-year mean follow-up. Follow-up was extended to determine whether late trends would favor either treatment group.

Methods and Results

OAT randomized 2201 stable patients with infarct-related artery total occlusion > 24 hours (calendar days 3–28) after myocardial infarction. Patients with severe inducible ischemia, rest angina, class III-IV heart failure, and 3-vessel/left main disease were excluded. We conducted extended follow-up of enrolled patients for an additional 3 years for the primary end point and angina (6-year median survivor follow-up; longest, 9 years; 12 234 patient-years). Rates of the primary end point (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.28), fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.75), death, and class IV heart failure were similar for the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and medical therapy alone groups. No interactions between baseline characteristics and treatment group on outcomes were observed. The vast majority of patients at each follow-up visit did not report angina. There was less angina in the PCI group through early in follow-up; by 3 years, the between group difference was consistently < 4 patients per 100 treated and not significantly different, although there was a trend toward less angina in the PCI group at 3 and 5 years. The 7-year rate of PCI of the infarct-related artery during follow-up was 11.1% for the PCI group compared with 14.7% for the medical therapy alone group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–1.01; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Extended follow-up of the OAT cohort provides robust evidence for no reduction of long-term rates of clinical events after routine PCI in stable patients with a totally occluded infarct-related artery and without severe inducible ischemia in the subacute phase after myocardial infarction.

### Lack of benefit from percutaneous intervention of persistently occluded infarct arteries after the acute phase of myocardial infarction is time independent: insights from occluded artery trial [^a1564103]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) (n = 2201) showed no benefit for routine percutaneous intervention (PCI) (n = 1101) over medical therapy (MED) (n = 1100) on the combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and class IV heart failure (congestive heart failure) in stable post-MI patients with late occluded infarct-related arteries (IRAs). We evaluated the potential for selective benefit with PCI over MED for patients enrolled early in OAT.

Methods and Results

We explored outcomes with PCI over MED in patients randomized to the ≤ 3 calendar days and ≤ 7 calendar days post-MI time windows. Earlier, times to randomization in OAT were associated with higher rates of the combined endpoint (adjusted HR 1.04/day: 99% CI 1.01–1.06; P < 0.001). The 48-month event rates for ≤ 3 days, ≤ 7 days post-MI enrolled patients were similar for PCI vs. MED for the combined and individual endpoints. There was no interaction between time to randomization defined as a continuous (P = 0.55) or categorical variable with a cut-point of 3 days (P = 0.98) or 7 days (P = 0.64) post-MI and treatment effect.

Conclusion

Consistent with overall OAT findings, patients enrolled in the ≤ 3 day and ≤ 7 day post-MI time windows derived no benefit with PCI over MED with no interaction between time to randomization and treatment effect. Our findings do not support routine PCI of the occluded IRA in trial-eligible patients even in the earliest 24–72 h time window.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention in the occluded artery trial: procedural success, hazard, and outcomes over 5 years [^d0411ca4]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) was a 2,201-patient randomized clinical trial comparing routine stent-based percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus optimal medical therapy alone in stable myocardial infarction (MI) survivors with persistent infarct-related artery occlusion identified day 3 to 28 post MI. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference between strategies with respect to the incidence of new class IV congestive heart failure, MI, or death. The influence of PCI failure, procedural hazard, and crossover on trial results has not been reported.

Methods

Study angiograms were analyzed and adjudicated centrally. Factors associated with PCI failure were examined. Time-to-event analysis using the OAT primary outcome was performed by PCI success status. Landmark analysis (up to and beyond 30 days) partitioned early hazard versus late outcome according to treatment received.

Results

Percutaneous coronary intervention was adjudicated successful in > 87%. Percutaneous coronary intervention failure rates were similar in US and non-US sites, and did not significantly influence outcome at 60 months (hazard ratio for success vs fail 0.79, 99% CI 0.45–1.40, P = 0.29). Partitioning of early procedural hazard revealed no late benefit for PCI (hazard ratio for PCI success vs medical therapy alone 1.06, 99% CI 0.75–1.50, P = 0.66).

Conclusions

Percutaneous coronary intervention failure and complication rates in the OAT were low. Neither PCI failure nor early procedural hazard substantively influenced the primary trial results.

### Loss of short-term symptomatic benefit in patients with an occluded infarct artery is unrelated to non-protocol revascularization: results from the occluded artery trial (OAT) [^51330c50]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

the OAT found that routine late (3–28 days post-myocardial infarction) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of an occluded infarct-related artery did not reduce death, reinfarction, or heart failure relative to medical treatment (MED). Angina rates were lower in PCI early, but the advantage over MED was lost by 3 years.

Methods

angina and revascularization status were collected at 4 months, then annually. We assessed whether non-protocol revascularization procedures in MED accounted for loss of the early symptomatic advantage of PCI.

Results

seven per 100 more PCI patients were angina-free at 4 months (P < .001) and 5 per 100 at 12 months (P = 0.005) with the difference narrowing to 1 per 100 at 3 years (P = 0.34). Non-protocol revascularization was more frequent in MED (5-year rate 22% vs 19% PCI, P = 0.05). Indications for revascularization included acute coronary syndromes (39% PCI vs 38% MED), stable angina/inducible ischemia (39% in each group), and physician preference (17% PCI vs 15% MED). Revascularization rates among patients with angina at any time during follow-up (35% of cohort) did not differ by treatment group (5-year rates 26% PCI vs 28% MED). Most symptomatic patients were treated without revascularization during follow-up (77%).

Conclusions

in a large randomized clinical trial of stable post-myocardial infarction patients, the modest benefit on angina from PCI of an occluded infarct-related artery was lost by 3 years. Revascularization was slightly more common in MED during follow-up but was not driven by acute ischemia, and almost 1 in 5 procedures were attributed to physician preference alone.

### Impact of left ventricular ejection fraction on clinical outcomes over five years after infarct-related coronary artery recanalization (from the occluded artery trial [OAT]) [^8cb616c9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of an infarct-related artery on days 3 to 28 after acute myocardial infarction was of no benefit compared to medical therapy alone. The present analysis was conducted to determine whether PCI might provide benefit to the subgroup of higher risk patients with a depressed ejection fraction (EF). Of 2,185 analyzed patients (age 58.6 ± 11.0 years) with infarct-related artery occlusion on days 3 to 28 after acute myocardial infarction in the Occluded Artery Trial, 1,094 were assigned to PCI and 1,091 to medical therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death, reinfarction, and New York Heart Association class IV heart failure. The outcomes were analyzed by EF (first tertile, EF ≤ 44%, vs second and third tertiles combined, EF > 44%). Interaction of the treatment effect with EF on the study outcomes were examined using the Cox survival model. The 5-year rates of the primary end point (death, reinfarction, or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure) were not different in either subgroup (PCI vs medical therapy, hazard ratio 1.25, 99% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.88, for EF ≤ 44%; hazard ratio 0.98, 99% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.50, for EF > 44%). However, in patients with an EF > 44%, PCI reduced the rate of subsequent revascularization (p = 0.004, interaction p = 0.05). In conclusion, optimal medical therapy remains the overall treatment of choice for stable patients with a persistent total occlusion of the infarct-related artery after acute myocardial infarction, irrespective of the baseline EF. In patients with normal or moderately impaired left ventricular contractility, PCI reduced the need for subsequent revascularization but did not otherwise improve outcomes.

### Late coronary intervention for totally occluded left anterior descending coronary arteries in stable patients after myocardial infarction: results from the occluded artery trial (OAT) [^766d93f1]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We analyzed a prespecified hypothesis of the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) that late percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarct-related artery (IRA) would be most beneficial for patients with anterior myocardial infarction (MI).

Methods

Two thousand two hundred one stable, high-risk patients with total occlusion of the IRA (793 left anterior descending [LAD]) on days 3 to 28 (minimum of 24 hours) after MI were randomized to PCI and stenting with optimal medical therapy (1,101 patients) or to optimal medical therapy alone (1,100 patients). The primary end point was a composite of death, recurrent MI, or hospitalization for class IV heart failure.

Results

The 5-year cumulative primary end point rate was more frequent in the LAD group (19.5%) than in the non-LAD group (16.4%) (HR 1.34, 99% CI 1.00–1.81, P = 0.01). Within the LAD group, the HR for the primary end point in the PCI group (22.7%) compared with the medical therapy group (16.4%) was 1.35 (99% CI 0.86–2.13, P = 0.09), whereas in the non-LAD group the HR for the primary end point in PCI (16.9%) compared with medical therapy (15.8%) was 1.03 (99% CI 0.70–1.52, P = 0.83) (interaction P = 0.24). The results were similar when the effect of PCI was assessed in patients with proximal LAD occlusion.

Conclusions

In stable patients, persistent total occlusion of the LAD post MI is associated with a worse prognosis compared with occlusion of the other IRAs. A strategy of PCI of occluded LAD IRA > 24 hours post MI in stable patients is not beneficial and may increase risk of adverse events in comparison to optimal medical treatment alone.

### Reinfarction after percutaneous coronary intervention or medical management using the universal definition in patients with total occlusion after myocardial infarction: results from long-term follow-up of the occluded artery trial (OAT) cohort [^86592f1e]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The OAT study randomized 2,201 patients with a totally occluded infarct-related artery on days 3 to 28 (> 24 hours) after myocardial infarction (MI) to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical treatment (MED). There was no difference in the primary end point of death, reinfarction, or heart failure at 2.9 or 6-year mean follow-up. However, in patients randomized to PCI, there was a trend toward a higher rate of reinfarction.

Methods

We analyzed the characteristics and types of reinfarction according to the universal definition. Independent predictors of reinfarction were determined using Cox proportional hazard models with follow-up up to 9 years.

Results

There were 169 reinfarctions: 9.4% PCI vs 8.0% MED, hazard ratio 1.31, 95% CI 0.97–1.77, P = 0.08. Spontaneous reinfarction (type 1) occurred with similar frequency in the groups: 4.9% PCI vs 6.7% MED, hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.53–1.15, P = 0.21. Rates of type 2 (secondary) and 3 (sudden death) MI were similar in both groups. There was an increase in type 4a reinfarctions (related to protocol or other PCI) (0.8% PCI vs 0.1% MED, P = 0.01) and type 4b reinfarctions (stent thrombosis) (2.7% PCI vs 0.6% MED, P < .001). Multivariate predictors of reinfarction were history of PCI before study entry (P = 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.005), and absence of new Q waves with the index infarction (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

There was a trend for reinfarctions to be more frequent with PCI. Opening an occluded infarct-related artery in stable patients with late post-MI may expose them to a risk of subsequent reinfarction related to reocclusion and stent thrombosis.

### Electrophysiological effects of late percutaneous coronary intervention for infarct-related coronary artery occlusion: the occluded artery trial-electrophysiological mechanisms (OAT-EP) [^f16d6eb1]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The Occluded Artery Trial-Electrophysiological Mechanisms (OAT-EP) tested the hypothesis that opening a persistently occluded infarct-related artery by percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting (PCI) after the acute phase of myocardial infarction compared with optimal medical therapy alone reduces markers of vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias.

Methods and Results

Between April 2003 and December 2005, 300 patients with an occluded native infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days (median, 12 days) after myocardial infarction were randomized to PCI or optimal medical therapy. Ten-minute digital Holter recordings were obtained before randomization, at 30 days, and at 1 year. The primary end point was the change in alpha1, a nonlinear heart rate variability parameter, between baseline and 1 year. Major secondary end points were the changes in the filtered QRS duration on the signal-averaged ECG and variability in T-wave morphology (T-wave variability) between baseline and 1 year. There were no significant differences in the changes in alpha1 (-0.04; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.04), filtered QRS (2.2 ms; 95% CI, -1.4 to 5.9 ms), or T-wave variability (3.0 microV; 95% CI, -4.8 to 10.7 microV) between the PCI and medical therapy groups (medical therapy change minus PCI change). Multivariable analysis revealed that the results were unchanged after adjustment for baseline clinical variables and medication treatments during the Holter recordings.

Conclusions

PCI with stenting of a persistently occluded infarct-related artery during the subacute phase after myocardial infarction compared with medical therapy alone had no significant effect on changes in heart rate variability, the time-domain signal-averaged ECG, or T-wave variability during the first year after myocardial infarction. These findings are consistent with the lack of clinical benefit, including no reduction in sudden death, with PCI for stable patients with persistently occluded infarct-related arteries after myocardial infarction in the main OAT.

### The occluded artery trial (OAT) viability ancillary study (OAT-NUC): influence of infarct zone viability on left ventricular remodeling after percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy alone [^91a0d7f7]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) showed no difference in outcomes between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus optimal medical therapy (MED) in patients with persistent total occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days post-myocardial infarction. Whether PCI may benefit a subset of patients with preservation of infarct zone (IZ) viability is unknown.

Methods and Results

The OAT nuclear ancillary study hypothesized that (1) IZ viability influences left ventricular (LV) remodeling and that (2) PCI as compared with MED attenuates adverse remodeling in post-myocardial infarction patients with preserved viability. Enrolled were 124 OAT patients who underwent resting nitroglycerin-enhanced technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before OAT randomization, with repeat imaging at 1 year. All images were quantitatively analyzed for infarct size, IZ viability, LV volumes, and function in a core laboratory. At baseline, mean infarct size was 26% ± 18 of the LV, mean IZ viability was 43% ± 8 of peak uptake, and most patients (70%) had at least moderately retained IZ viability. There were no significant differences in 1-year end-diastolic or end-systolic volume change between those with severely reduced versus moderately retained IZ viability, or when compared by treatment assignment PCI versus MED. In multivariable models, increasing baseline viability independently predicted improvement in ejection fraction (P = 0.005). There was no interaction between IZ viability and treatment assignment for any measure of LV remodeling.

Conclusions

In the contemporary era of MED, PCI of the infarct-related artery compared with MED alone does not impact LV remodeling irrespective of IZ viability.

### Comparison of late results of percutaneous coronary intervention among stable patients ≤ 65 versus > 65 years of age with an occluded infarct related artery (from the occluded artery trial) [^85f59f7d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although opening an occluded infarct-related artery > 24 hours after myocardial infarction in stable patients in the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) did not reduce events over 7 years, there was a suggestion that the effect of treatment might differ by patient age. Baseline characteristics and outcomes by treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus optimal medical therapy alone were compared by prespecified stratification at age 65 years. A p value < 0.01 was prespecified as significant for OAT secondary analyses. The primary outcome was death, myocardial infarction, or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure. Patients aged > 65 years (n = 641) were more likely to be female, to be nonsmokers, and to have hypertension, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates, and multivessel disease compared to younger patients (aged ≤ 65 years, n = 1,560) (p < 0.001). There was no significant observed interaction between treatment assignment and age for the primary outcome after adjustment (p = 0.10), and there was no difference between PCI and optimal medical therapy observed in either age group. At 7-year follow-up, younger patients tended to have angina more often compared to the older group (hazard ratio 1.21, 99% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.46, p = 0.01). The 7-year composite primary outcome was more common in older patients (p < 0.001), and age remained significant after covariate adjustment (hazard ratio 1.42, 99% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.84). The rate of early PCI complications was low in the 2 age groups. The trend toward a differential effect of PCI in the young versus the old for the primary outcome was likely driven by measured and unmeasured confounders and by chance. PCI reduces angina to a similar degree in the young and old. In conclusion, there is no indication for routine PCI to open a persistently occluded infarct-related artery in stable patients after myocardial infarction, regardless of age.

### Heart failure in post-MI patients with persistent IRA occlusion: prevalence, risk factors, and the long-term effect of PCI in the occluded artery trial (OAT) [^4e3e8556]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence and predictors of heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI) with modern post-MI treatment have not been well characterized.

Methods and Results

A total of 2,201 stable patients with persistent infarct-related artery occlusion > 24 hours after MI with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% and/or proximal coronary artery occlusion were randomized to percutaneous intervention plus optimal medical therapy (PCI) or optimal medical therapy (MED) alone. Centrally adjudicated HF hospitalizations for New York Heart Association (NYHA) III/IV HF and mortality were determined in patients with and without baseline HF, defined as a history of HF, Killip Class > I at index MI, rales, S3 gallop, NYHA II at randomization, or NYHA > I before index MI. Long-term follow-up data were used to determine 7-year life-table estimated event rates and hazard ratios. There were 150 adjudicated HF hospitalizations during a mean follow-up of 6 years with no difference between the randomized groups (7.4% PCI vs. 7.5% MED, P = 0.97). Adjudicated HF hospitalization was associated with subsequent death (44.0% vs. 13.1%, HR 3.31, 99% CI 2.21–4.92, P < .001). Baseline HF (present in 32% of patients) increased the risk of adjudicated HF hospitalization (13.6% vs. 4.7%, HR 3.43, 99% CI 2.23–5.26, P < .001) and death (24.7% vs. 10.8%, HR 2.31, 99% CI 1.71–3.10, P < .001).

Conclusions

In the overall Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) population, adjudicated HF hospitalizations occurred in 7.5% of subjects and were associated with increased risk of subsequent death. Baseline or prior HF was common in the OAT population and was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death.

### Distribution and determinants of myocardial perfusion grade following late mechanical recanalization of occluded infarct-related arteries postmyocardial infarction: a report from the occluded artery trial [^03e04263]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the distribution and determinants of myocardial perfusion grade (MPG) following late recanalization of persistently occluded infarct-related arteries (IRA).

Background

MPG reflects microvascular integrity. It is an independent prognostic factor following myocardial infarction, but has been studied mainly in the setting of early reperfusion. The occluded artery trial (OAT) enrolled stable patients with persistently occluded IRAs beyond 24 hr and up to 28 days post-MI.

Methods

Myocardial blush was assessed using TIMI MPG grading in 261 patients with TIMI 3 epicardial flow following IRA PCI. Patients demonstrating impaired (0–1) versus preserved (2–3) MPG were compared with regard to baseline clinical and pre-PCI angiographic characteristics.

Results

Impaired MPG was observed in 60 of 261 patients (23%). By univariate analysis, impaired MPG was associated with failed fibrinolytic therapy, higher heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, lower ejection fraction, LAD occlusion, absence of collaterals (P < 0.01) and ST elevation MI, lower diastolic blood pressure, and higher systolic sphericity index (P < 0.05). By multivariable analysis, higher heart rate, LAD occlusion, absence of collaterals and higher systolic sphericity index (P < 0.01), and lower systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05) were independently associated with impaired MPG.

Conclusion

Preserved microvascular integrity was present in a high proportion of patients following late recanalization of occluded IRAs post-MI. Presence of collaterals was independently associated with preserved MPG and likely accounted for the high frequency of preserved myocardial perfusion in this clinical setting. Impaired MPG was associated with baseline clinical and angiographic features consistent with larger infarct size.

### The late open-coronary artery hypothesis: dead, or not definitively tested? [^df9a3596]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Continued controversy surrounds the optimal therapeutic approach to the patient who does not undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) early during acute myocardial infarction, when ischemic myocardium could still be salvaged, and who presents days to weeks after the acute event with persistent total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) demonstrated no measurable effect of PCI on outcome. There were trends, however, for more frequent reinfarctions and a higher estimated 4-year cumulative primary event rate. Because patient selection included only patients with 1- or 2-vessel coronary disease, and because interventionalists were permitted to perform PCI on the noninfarct-related arteries, > 85% of patients in the intervention group had no coronary arteries with significant obstructions after PCI, a situation that would cause the functional regression of existing collaterals. If subsequent plaque rupture and total occlusion of any of the 3 coronary arteries occurred (expected in 5% to 15% of patients with acute coronary syndromes over the first 1 to 2 years), the impaired collateral flow immediately after new acute occlusion would predispose to greater myocardial injury and therefore greater patient risk, which could explain the negative effects of the OAT study, and which raises the disturbing possibility that complete revascularization in patients with recent acute coronary syndromes could possibly lead to greater risks in the following 1 to 2 years in those patients who experience recurrent acute coronary occlusion. Conversely, late opening of the culprit artery in patients with multivessel coronary disease, without all arteries being patent, may favorably alter late outcomes. In conclusion, the therapeutic implications of the OAT study apply to a specific patient cohort; whether late opening of the culprit artery improves or impairs outcome appears critically to depend on the specific cohort treated.

### Impact of stress testing before percutaneous coronary intervention or medical management on outcomes of patients with persistent total occlusion after myocardial infarction: analysis from the occluded artery trial [^7a6647d5]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), 2,201 stable patients with an occluded infarct-related artery (IRA) were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or optimal medical treatment alone (MED). There was no difference in the primary end point of death, reinfarction, or congestive heart failure (CHF). We examined the prognostic impact of prerandomization stress testing.

Methods

Stress testing was required by protocol except for patients with single-vessel disease and akinesis/dyskinesis of the infarct zone. The presence of severe inducible ischemia was an exclusion criterion for OAT. We compared outcomes based on performance and results of stress testing.

Results

Five hundred ninety-eight (27%) patients (297 PCI, 301 MED) underwent stress testing. Radionuclide imaging or stress echocardiography was performed in 40%. Patients who had stress testing were younger (57 vs 59 years); had higher ejection fractions (49% vs 47%); and had lower rates of death (7.8% vs 13.2%), class IV CHF (2.4% vs 5.5%), and the primary end point (13.9% vs 18.9%) than patients without stress testing (all P < .01). Mild-moderate ischemia was observed in 40% of patients with stress testing and was not related to outcomes. Among patients with inducible ischemia, outcomes were similar for PCI and MED (all P > .10).

Conclusions

In OAT, patients who underwent stress testing had better outcomes than patients who did not, likely related to differences in baseline characteristics. In patients managed with optimal medical therapy or PCI, mild-moderate inducible ischemia was not related to outcomes. The lack of benefit for PCI compared to MED alone was consistent regardless of whether stress testing was performed or inducible ischemia was present.

### Angiographic and clinical outcomes of drug-eluting versus bare metal stent deployment in the occluded artery trial [^d47f23a2]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of patients randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) and its angiographic substudy, the Total Occlusion Study of Canada 2 (TOSCA-2) were treated with bare metal stents (BMS). We aimed to determine if stenting of the target occlusion in OAT with drug-eluting stents (DES) was associated with more favorable angiographic results and clinical outcome when compared with treatment with BMS.

Methods

TOSCA-2 DES was a prospective nonrandomized substudy that provided 1-year angiographic comparison of late loss and reocclusion in 25 patients treated with DES and in 128 treated with BMS. In addition, all PCI-assigned patients enrolled from the time when DES were first utilized were similarly categorized (DES n = 77, and BMS n = 386) and compared using the 3-year cumulative OAT primary combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or Class-IV heart failure, as well as angina.

Results

In-segment late loss was 0.14 ± 0.45 mm for DES and 0.75 ± 0.86 mm for BMS (P < 0.001). Corresponding binary restenosis rates were 13.0% and 44.3% (P = 0.005). Occlusion at 1 year was observed in 4.0 and 12.1%, respectively (P = 0.23). The 3-year cumulative primary event rate was 13.8% with DES and 12.5% with BMS (hazard ratio 1.08, 99% confidence intervals 0.44, 2.64; P = 0.83). Angina over time occurred less frequently in the DES group (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Although the reduction of late loss and trend to reduction in reocclusion with the use of DES for PCI of persistently occluded IRA 3–28 days post myocardial infarction did not translate into a signal for reduction in death, reinfarction, or Class IV heart failure, DES use was associated with less angina over time. Further follow-up is warranted.

### Infarct artery distribution and clinical outcomes in occluded artery trial subjects presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (from the long-term follow-up of occluded artery trial [OAT]) [^7bd0d7aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the insensitivity of the electrocardiogram in identifying acute circumflex occlusion would result in differences in the distribution of the infarct-related artery (IRA) between patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and STEMI enrolled in the Occluded Artery Trial. We also sought to evaluate the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention to the IRA on the clinical outcomes for patients with NSTEMI. Overall, those with NSTEMI constituted 13% (n = 283) of the trial population. The circumflex IRA was overrepresented in the NSTEMI group compared to the STEMI group (42.5 vs 11.2%; p < 0.0001). The 7-year clinical outcomes for the patients with NSTEMI randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention and optimal medical therapy versus optimal medical therapy alone were similar for the primary composite of death, myocardial infarction, and class IV congestive heart failure (22.3% vs 20.2%, hazard ratio 1.20, 99% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.40; p = 0.51) and the individual end points of death (13.8% vs 17.0%, hazard ratio 0.82, 99% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.84; p = 0.53), myocardial infarction (6.1 vs 5.1%, hazard ratio 1.11, 99% confidence interval 0.28 to 4.41; p = 0.84), and class IV congestive heart failure (6.7% vs 6.0%, hazard ratio 1.50, 99% confidence interval 0.37 to 6.02; p = 0.45). No interaction was seen between the electrocardiographically determined myocardial infarction type and treatment effect (p = NS). In conclusion, the occluded circumflex IRA is overrepresented in the NSTEMI population. Consistent with the overall trial results, stable patients with NSTEMI and a totally occluded IRA did not benefit from randomization to percutaneous coronary intervention.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint Committee on Clinical practice guidelines [^dc120b53]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

STEMI management after fibrinolysis and special situations: Studies have shown a reduction in MACE when routine early angiography with the intent to perform PCI is performed after fibrinolytic therapy, and in early-transfer studies, more than 80% of patients who were transferred underwent PCI to treat a significant residual stenosis or suboptimal flow of the infarct artery. The benefit of PCI for asymptomatic patients presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset is not well studied, but the BRAVE-2 trial examined patients with symptom onset > 12 hours but < 48 hours before presentation and, in this small study, an invasive strategy of coronary stenting was associated with a reduction in left ventricular infarct size compared with a conservative strategy. Therefore, delayed PCI of an infarct artery beyond 24 hours should be considered only in patients with a patent artery. There are no RCTs examining the benefit of PCI in patients with STEMI presenting > 12 hours after symptom onset who have clinical evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe heart failure, or life-threatening arrhythmias, and for this reason PCI should be considered. In OAT, PCI of a totally occluded vessel did not reduce cardiovascular events at 4 years of follow-up, and there was a trend toward a higher rate of recurrent infarction, and similar findings were noted in DECOPI, which enrolled patients presenting 2 to 15 days after symptom onset. Emergency CABG to restore flow to the infarct artery after failed PCI should be considered only in patients with ongoing ischemia and a large area of myocardium at risk.

### Where does the occluded artery trial leave the late open artery hypothesis? [^186c8718]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

As of April 2007 the early open artery hypothesis is alive and well, but the late open artery hypothesis is adrift. For the foreseeable future, stable patients with persistent occlusion of the infarct artery late after myocardial infarction, and without severe ischaemia or uncontrollable angina, should be managed initially with optimal medical treatment alone, and not with percutaneous coronary intervention. Efforts should focus on establishing reperfusion earlier, including reducing the time to patient presentation.

### Relationship of female sex to outcomes after myocardial infarction with persistent total occlusion of the infarct artery: analysis of the occluded artery trial (OAT) [^aa0b6d24]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term follow-up (up to 9 years) from the OAT allows for the examination of sex differences in outcomes and the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a relatively homogeneous cohort of myocardial infarction (MI) survivors.

Methods

The OAT randomized 484 (22%) women and 1717 men to PCI of the occluded infarct-related artery vs medical therapy alone > 24 hours post-MI. There was no benefit of PCI on the composite of death, MI, and class IV heart failure. We analyzed outcomes by sex and investigated for sex-based trial selection bias using a concurrent registry.

Results

Women were older and more likely to have left anterior descending infarct-related artery, diabetes and hypertension, history of heart failure, and rales at randomization but were less likely to smoke. The proportion and characteristics of women enrolled in the trial and the registry were similar, including left ventricular ejection fraction and extent of disease. Women had higher rates of the primary composite (hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, P = 0.0002), death (HR 1.50, P = 0.001), and heart failure (HR 2.53, P < .0001) but not reinfarction (HR 1.12, P = 0.57). Female sex was not independently associated with the primary end point or death on multivariate analysis. There was a trend toward independent association of female sex with heart failure (HR 1.66, P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Women in OAT had a higher primary end point event rate than did men, mainly driven by heart failure. Female sex was not independently associated with death or MI in this well-defined cohort with comparable extent of coronary artery disease, similar medical therapy, and equivalent left ventricular ejection fraction by sex.

### Risk stratification post-myocardial infarction: is early coronary angiography the more effective strategy? [^0aff34ee]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The primary management strategy for the post-myocardial infarction patient continues to be controversial despite published guidelines. In part, this is the consequence of study designs that are not directly applicable to individual patients, but also to the rapidly changing pharmacological and mechanical device armamentarium that rapidly renders clinical trial results obsolete within a few years. This review attempts to highlight those areas where there is consensus as well as to explicate those situations where common clinical practice appears to be in conflict with accepted guidelines.

### Effect of late revascularization of a totally occluded coronary artery after myocardial infarction on mortality rates in patients with renal impairment [^55e061a6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and a negative prognostic indicator after myocardial infarction (MI). Randomized data comparing percutaneous coronary intervention to medical therapy in patients with MI with renal insufficiency are needed. The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) compared optimal medical therapy alone to percutaneous coronary intervention with optimal medical therapy in 2,201 high-risk patients with occluded infarct arteries > 24 hours after MI with serum creatinine levels ≤ 2.5 mg/dl. The primary end point was a composite of death, MI, and class IV heart failure (HF). Analyses were carried out using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a continuous variable and by eGFR categories. Long-term follow-up data (maximum 9 years) were used for this analysis. Lower eGFR was associated with development of the primary outcome (6-year life-table rates of 16.9% for eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m², 19.2% for eGFR 60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m², and 34.9% for eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²; p < 0.0001), death, and class IV HF, with no difference in rates of reinfarction. On multivariate analysis, eGFR was an independent predictor of death and HF. There was no effect of treatment assignment on the primary end point regardless of eGFR, and there was no significant interaction between eGFR and treatment assignment on any outcome. In conclusion, lower eGFR at enrollment was independently associated with death and HF in OAT participants. Despite this increased risk, the lack of benefit from percutaneous coronary intervention in the overall trial was also seen in patients with renal dysfunction and persistent occlusion of the infarct artery in the subacute phase after MI.

### Long-term outcomes after a strategy of percutaneous coronary intervention of the infarct-related artery with drug-eluting stents or bare metal stents vs medical therapy alone in the occluded artery trial (OAT) [^7c370f17]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The OAT, a randomized study of routine percutaneous coronary intervention or optimal medical therapy (MED) alone for the treatment of a totally occluded infarct-related artery in the subacute phase after myocardial infarction, showed similar rates of death, reinfarction and congestive heart failure (CHF) between study groups. Although most percutaneous coronary intervention patients were treated with bare metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES) were also implanted in the latter part of the study. The aim of the study was to conduct an exploratory analysis of long-term outcomes for DES vs. BMS deployment vs. MED in the OAT.

Methods

Patients enrolled after February 2003 (when first DES was implanted) were followed (DES n = 79, BMS n = 393, MED n = 552) up to a maximum of 6 years (mean survivor follow-up 5.1 years).

Results

The 6-year occurrence of the composite end point of death, reinfarction and class IV CHF was similar [20.4% of DES, 18.9% of BMS and 18.4% of MED (P = 0.66)] as were the rates of the components of the primary end point. During the follow-up period, 33.4% of DES, 44.4% of BMS and 48.1% of MED patients, developed angina (P = 0.037). The rate of revascularization during follow up was 11.3%, 20.5% and 22.5% among these groups, respectively (P = 0.045).

Conclusions

There is no suggestion of reduced long-term risk of death, reinfarction or class IV CHF with DES usage compared to BMS or medical treatment alone. An association between DES use and freedom from angina and revascularization relative to medical therapy is suggested.

### Persistent reservations against contradicted percutaneous coronary intervention indications: citation content analysis [^f6f141cd]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Two large trials, Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) and Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), found no benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus optimal medical therapy in chronic stable coronary artery disease and chronic total occlusion.

Methods

We examined the stance of articles citing COURAGE and OAT to determine whether some authors continue to defend PCI despite this evidence, what persisting counterarguments are raised to express reservations, and whether specific characteristics of the citations are associated with reservations. We evaluated all citing articles entered in the Web of Science until February 1, 2008. Specific characteristics were recorded for each eligible citation, and a citation content analysis was performed. Counterarguments were categorized on participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes.

Results

Of 54 articles citing COURAGE and 33 articles citing OAT, 10 (19%) and 5 (15%), respectively, had an overall reserved stance. Alluded reservations included lack of power, eroded effects from crossover, selective inclusion and exclusion of specific types of patients, suboptimal clinical setting, use of bare-metal stents, suspiciously good results in the conservative treatment arm, and suboptimal outcome choices or definitions. Reserved articles were more likely than unreserved ones to have an interventional cardiologist as corresponding author (odds ratio 5.2, 95% confidence interval 1.6–17.1; P = 0.007) and to be commentaries focusing on one of these trials (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0–11.0; P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Despite strong randomized evidence, a fraction of the literature, mostly corresponded by interventional cardiologists, continues to raise reservations about recently contradicted indications of PCI.

### Randomized trial of percutaneous coronary intervention for subacute infarct-related coronary artery occlusion to achieve long-term patency and improve ventricular function: the total occlusion study of Canada (TOSCA)-2 trial [^82ef65c0]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In the present study, we sought to determine whether opening a persistently occluded infarct-related artery (IRA) by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients beyond the acute phase of myocardial infarction (MI) improves patency and indices of left ventricular (LV) size and function.

Methods and Results

Between May 2000 and July 2005, 381 patients with an occluded native IRA 3 to 28 days after MI (median 10 days) were randomized to PCI with stenting (PCI) or optimal medical therapy alone. Repeat coronary and LV angiography was performed 1 year after randomization (n = 332, 87%). Coprimary end points were IRA patency and change in LV ejection fraction. Secondary end points included change in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices and wall motion. PCI was successful in 92%. At 1 year, 83% of PCI versus 25% of medical therapy-only patients had a patent IRA (P < 0.001). LV ejection fraction increased significantly (P < 0.001) in both groups, with no between-group difference: PCI 4.2 ± 8.9 (n = 150) versus medical therapy 3.5 ± 8.2 (n = 136; P = 0.47). Median change (interquartile range) in LV end-systolic volume index was -0.5 (-9.3 to 5.0) versus 1.0 (-5.7 to 7.3) mL/m² (P = 0.10), whereas median change (interquartile range) in LV end-diastolic volume index was 3.2 (-8.2 to 13.3) versus 5.3 (-4.6 to 23.2) mL/m² (P = 0.07) in the PCI (n = 86) and medical therapy-only (n = 76) groups, respectively.

Conclusions

PCI with stenting of a persistently occluded IRA in the subacute phase after MI effectively maintains long-term patency but has no effect on LV ejection fraction. On the basis of these findings and the lack of clinical benefit in the main Occluded Artery Trial, routine PCI is not recommended for stable patients with a persistently occluded IRA after MI.

### The late open artery hypothesis – a decade later [^81f5249d]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Early reperfusion after myocardial infarction has been proved to preserve left ventricular function and reduce mortality. However, a significant number of patients have persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery late (days to weeks) after myocardial infarction because of ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy, failure of reperfusion, or reocclusion.

Methods

In this report we review the data on the potential mechanisms and benefits of late reperfusion and present prospective data on the incidence of and current practice patterns for the management of persistently occluded infarct-related arteries late after myocardial infarction.

Results

Although several studies have associated late patency of the infarct-related artery with improved long-term clinical outcome, they were nonrandomized and reflect selection bias. Furthermore, data on late patency from the largest study, Global Utilization of Steptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Arteries (GUSTO-I), failed to confirm independent benefits of an open infarct-related artery 1 year after myocardial infarction. The randomized data on the effects of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for occluded infarct-related arteries late after myocardial infarction are limited and inconclusive.

Conclusions

The hypothesis that late reperfusion by percutaneous coronary intervention days to weeks after myocardial infarction results in improved long-term clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients with occluded infarct-related artery is currently being tested in the randomized, multicenter Occluded Artery Trial.

### Clinical significance of culprit vessel occlusion in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [^094e00fc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), total occlusion of the culprit coronary artery (OCA) is not uncommon. We sought to determine the frequency and clinical impact of OCA at presentation in a large population of patients presenting with NSTEMI and who underwent systematic early invasive management. We performed a post hoc analysis of the TAO (Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome with Otamixaban) randomized trial, which included patients with NSTEMI with systematic coronary angiography within 72 hours. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients according to whether the culprit vessel was occluded (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade [TFG] 0 to 1) or patent (TFG 2 to 3) at presentation. A total of 7,473 patients with NSTEMI with only 1 culprit lesion identified were enrolled, of whom 1,702 patients had OCA (22.8%). In the OCA group, coronary angiography was performed earlier (18 ± 15 vs 20 ± 16 hours, p < 0.01), the culprit lesion was less likely to be the left anterior descending artery (26.5% vs 41.4%, p < 0.001) but with more frequent angiographic thrombus (49.9% vs 22.7%, p < 0.01). Culprit artery percutaneous coronary intervention during the index procedure was also more frequent (88.5% vs 78.1%, p < 0.001) but with a lower rate of TFG grade 3 after the procedure and higher subsequent peak troponin I levels (8.3 ± 13.6 µg/L vs 5.6 ± 11.9 µg/L, p < 0.001). At day 7, patients with OCA had higher mortality, and this persisted after adjustment on gender, Grace risk score, cardiovascular risk factors, and culprit vessel location (0.9% vs 0.4%, p = 0.02; adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23 to 5.29, p = 0.01). The absolute difference of mortality was maintained through 30 days: 1.2% versus 0.8%, p = 0.13; OR: 1.72, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.05, but mortality rates were similar by 180 days: 1.5% versus 1.6%, p = 0.8, adjusted OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.80, p = 0.66. In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with NSTEMI have a totally occluded culprit vessel at presentation. These patients are at higher risk of early mortality but not at 6 months.

### Impact of collateral flow to the occluded infarct-related artery on clinical outcomes in patients with recent myocardial infarction: a report from the randomized occluded artery trial [^9cee7f50]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Collateral flow to the infarct artery territory after acute myocardial infarction may be associated with improved clinical outcomes and may also impact the benefit of subsequent recanalization of an occluded infarct-related artery.

Methods and Results

To understand the association between baseline collateral flow to the infarct territory on clinical outcomes and its interaction with percutaneous coronary intervention of an occluded infarct artery, long-term outcomes in 2173 patients with total occlusion of the infarct artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction from the randomized Occluded Artery Trial were analyzed according to angiographic collaterals documented at study entry. There were important differences in baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics as a function of collateral grade, with generally lower-risk characteristics associated with higher collateral grade. Higher collateral grade was associated with lower rates of death (P = 0.009), class III and IV heart failure (P < 0.0001) or either (P = 0.0002) but had no association with the risk of reinfarction. However, by multivariate analysis, collateral flow was neither an independent predictor of death nor of the primary end point of the trial (composite of death, reinfarction, or class IV heart failure). There was no interaction between angiographic collateral grade and the results of randomized treatment assignment (percutaneous coronary intervention or medical therapy alone) on clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

In recent myocardial infarction, angiographic collaterals to the occluded infarct artery are correlates but not independent predictors of major clinical outcomes. Late recanalization of the infarct artery in addition to medical therapy shows no benefit compared with medical therapy alone, regardless of the presence or absence of collaterals. Therefore, revascularization decisions in patients with recent myocardial infarction should not be based on the presence or grade of angiographic collaterals.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention for late reperfusion after myocardial infarction in stable patients [^4875f092]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Results of randomized trials that have compared mechanical coronary artery recanalization versus medical therapy for total occlusion late after myocardial infarction (MI) have been conflicting.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with medical therapy in stable patients with an occluded artery 1 to 45 days after MI. Six trials and one substudy were included with data on 2617 patients for the clinical outcomes and 653 patients for determination of ejection fraction (EF) during follow-up. Outcomes included death, MI, death or MI, congestive heart failure (CHF), and change in left ventricular EF.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences for any clinical outcome, with trends for an increase in MI (risk ratio 1.26, P = 0.19) and decrease in CHF (risk ratio 0.67, P = 0.19) in the PCI arm. The PCI arm showed a slight superiority in left ventricular EF (2%, 95% CI 0.1%-2.8%). Early smaller studies showed formally statistically significant benefits for CHF and EF, but the much larger Occluded Artery Trial and Total Occlusion Study of Canada 2 found no benefit. For CHF, the difference between early smaller studies and Occluded Artery Trial was beyond chance (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Percutaneous coronary intervention does not seem to confer any benefits when used for late revascularization of occluded arteries after MI in stable patients.

### Quality of life after late invasive therapy for occluded arteries [^747efb81]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

The open-artery hypothesis postulates that late opening of an infarct-related artery after myocardial infarction will improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the quality-of-life and economic outcomes associated with the use of this strategy.

Methods

We compared percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus stenting with medical therapy alone in high-risk patients in stable condition who had a totally occluded infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction. In 951 patients (44% of those eligible), we assessed quality of life by means of a battery of tests that included two principal outcome measures, the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) (which measures cardiac physical function on a scale from 0 to 58, with higher scores indicating better function) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Mental Health Inventory 5 (which measures psychological well-being). Structured quality-of-life interviews were performed at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Costs of treatment were assessed for 458 of 469 patients in the United States (98%), and 2-year cost-effectiveness was estimated.

Results

At 4 months, the medical-therapy group, as compared with the PCI group, had a clinically marginal decrease of 3.4 points in the DASI score (P = 0.007). At 1 and 2 years, the differences were smaller. No significant differences in psychological well-being were observed. For the 469 patients in the United States, cumulative 2-year costs were approximately $7,000 higher in the PCI group (P < 0.001), and the quality-adjusted survival was marginally longer in the medical-therapy group.

Conclusions

PCI was associated with a marginal advantage in cardiac physical function at 4 months but not thereafter. At 2 years, medical therapy remained significantly less expensive than routine PCI and was associated with marginally longer quality-adjusted survival. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00004562.)

### New frontiers and unresolved controversies in percutaneous coronary intervention [^df963077]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become a key modality of therapy of patients with coronary artery disease. However, with the exception of acute coronary syndromes, there is as yet no conclusive evidence from randomized controlled trials that PCI improves survival and outcome compared with optimal medical therapy. Randomized trials comparing PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with stable coronary artery disease conducted before stenting showed superiority of the surgical approach. Early results from stent trials continue to indicate better symptom relief and less need for repeat intervention with the surgical approach, although myocardial infarction and mortality are similar with the 2 revascularization modalities. In the setting of acute coronary syndromes, however, recent trials suggest superiority of an aggressive approach, including PCI, compared with a conservative strategy of medical therapy only. This benefit extends to patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, including those with shock. In the latter setting, mortality remains high and novel approaches to protect myocardial metabolism and improve perfusion will be needed to further improve survival. The role of revascularization in patients with completed myocardial infarction and persistently occluded arteries is much less clear. Although the late open artery hypothesis is widely accepted and interventional cardiologists routinely open late infarct-related coronary occlusions, the available evidence to justify this strategy is weak. New devices, such as thrombectomy devices in thrombus-laden lesions and drug-eluting stents, offer promise, although all lack the degree of proof of benefit and safety typically required of new pharmaceutical agents. As new technologies and therapies with the potential to improve outcomes and decelerate the atherosclerotic process are developed, it will be important for investigators and industry to collaborate in incorporating these advances into ongoing and new trials testing the efficacy of PCI in all settings.

### Delayed post-myocardial infarction invasive measures, helpful or harmful? A subgroup analysis [^bc10d87d]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In patients who have experienced acute myocardial infarction (MI), primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been shown to be of benefit in terms of clinical outcomes. However, the value of performing routine PCI in patients with early MI (ie, an MI occurring > 12 h to ≤ 7 days before patient presentation) or recent MI (ie, an MI occurring ≥ 8 days to < 30 days before patient presentation) has not been established. The purposes of this prospective observational study were to evaluate the impact of PCI on outcomes, and to delineate the predictors of lack of response to reperfusion and the prognostic determinants in patients with this clinical condition.

Methods and Results

A total of 377 consecutive unselected patients who had experienced early or recent MI underwent PCI. Successful reperfusion (ie, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 of the infarct-related artery [IRA]) was achieved in 90.2% of patients. By multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis, high-burden thrombus formation (odds ratio [OR], 15.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.09 to 39.60; p < 0.0001) in the IRA, early PCI (ie, ≤ 3 days) [OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.79 to 7.36; p = 0.0008], advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) [OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.70 to 9.91; p = 0.002], and diabetes (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.03 to 7.06; p = 0.010) were independent predictors for lack of response to reperfusion. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.8%. The only variables that were independently related to the 30-day mortality rate were advanced CHF (OR, 29.85; 95% CI, 7.84 to 113.7; p < 0.0001), lack of response to reperfusion (OR, 7.57; 95% CI, 2.29 to 25.07; p = 0.0009), early PCI (OR, 4.81; 95% CI, 1.60 to 14.41; p = 0.005), and multivessel disease (OR, 9.22; 95% CI, 1.63 to 52.04; p = 0.0119). The surviving 351 patients were discharged from the hospital and followed-up for a mean (± SD) 38.9 ± 14.2 months. Coronary angiographic follow-up was performed in 285 patients (81.2%). Restenosis of the IRA was found in 101 patients (35.4%). Reinterventions of the IRA were required in 69 patients (24.2%). Follow-up measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) showed significantly more improvement than the initial LVEF (59.3 ± 13.8% vs 50.4 ± 13%; p < 0.0001). The total cumulative mortality rate after hospital discharge was 6.5% for the entire group. Only advanced CHF (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.26 to 9.52; p = 0.016) and old age (ie, ≥ 70 years of age) [OR, 4.41; 95% CI, 1.59 to 12.24; p = 0.004] were independent predictors of long-term mortality.

Conclusion

The performance of PCI on ≥ day 4 in patients after they had experienced an MI was safe and had a high rate of success. The clinical benefits of a relative low mortality rate associated with successful PCI for patients with early and recent MI was maintained during the long-term follow-up. However, patients with advanced CHF along with old age continued to have a poor prognosis.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^3d9b6514]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) — PCI versus medical therapy effects on angina and QoL. In studies of patients with SIHD, PCI has been more effective than medical therapy in relieving angina, free from angina, and QoL. Improved QoL with PCI compared with medical therapy has been reported at late follow-up 5–8 years post procedure, but not at 3 years post procedure. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized, controlled trials of PCI versus medical therapy in 7,818 patients enrolled from 1987–2005 showed that complete angina relief was superior with PCI (odds ratio: 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.24–2.30) with the benefit limited to trials that enrolled patients before the year 2000; in pooled analysis of studies that enrolled patients after 2000, angina relief was similar for both therapies. Low baseline angina burden is noted, with two-thirds of patients in COURAGE having angina weekly or less frequently and 77% in OAT having no angina; non-randomized studies enrolling patients after 2000 with a higher prevalence of angina have demonstrated significantly better QoL with PCI compared with medical therapy.

### Myocardial perfusion grade after late infarct artery recanalization is associated with global and regional left ventricular function at one year: analysis from the total occlusion study of Canada-2 [^3fc14a50]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Whether myocardial perfusion grade (MPG) following late recanalization of infarct-related arteries (IRAs) predicts left ventricular (LV) function recovery beyond the acute phase of myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown.

Methods and Results

The Total Occlusion Study of Canada-2 enrolled stable patients with a persistently occluded IRA beyond 24 hours and up to 28 days post-MI. We studied the relationship between the initial MPG and changes in LV function and volume as well as the change in MPG from immediate post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to 1 year in 139 PCI patients with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 epicardial flow post-PCI and with paired values grouped into impaired or good MPG groups (MPG 0/1 or MPG 2/3). MPG 0/1 patients were more likely to have received thrombolytic therapy and to have a left anterior descending IRA. They had lower blood pressure and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and a higher heart rate and systolic sphericity index at baseline. Changes in the MPG 0/1 and MPG 2/3 groups from baseline to 1 year were LVEF, 3.3 ± 9.0% and 4.8 ± 8.9% (P = 0.42); LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), -1.1 ± 9.2 and -4.7 ± 12.3 mL/m(2) (P = 0.25); LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), 0.08 ± 19.1 and -2.4 ± 22.2 mL/m(2) (P = 0.67); and SDs/chord for infarct zone wall motion index (WMI), 0.38 ± 0.70 and 0.84 ± 1.11 (P = 0.01). By covariate-adjusted analysis, post-PCI MPG 0/1 predicted lower WMI (P < 0.001), lower LVEF (P < 0.001), and higher LVESVI (P < 0.01) but not LVEDVI at 1 year. Of the MPG 0/1 patients, 60% were MPG 2 or 3 at 1 year.

Conclusions

Preserved MPG is present in a high proportion of patients following late PCI of occluded IRAs post-MI. Poor MPG post-PCI frequently improves MPG over 1 year. MPG graded after IRA recanalization undertaken days to weeks post MI is associated with LV recovery, indicating that MPG determined in the subacute post-MI period remains a marker of viability.

### Late percutaneous coronary intervention for the totally occluded infarct-related artery: a meta-analysis of the effects on cardiac function and remodeling [^77de4546]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Late percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a totally occluded infarct-related artery (IRA) in stable patients is currently not recommended based on the lack of clear clinical benefits in randomized controlled trials. We sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing PCI with optimal medical therapy in patients with IRA occlusion more than 12 hr after onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), focusing on left ventricular function and remodeling.

Methods and Results

PubMed, CENTRAL, and mRCT were searched for eligible studies. Studies were included in the analysis if they were randomized controlled trials comparing conservative medical management with PCI performed at least 12 hr after the onset of symptoms of AMI, and data on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline and follow-up were available. Studies were excluded if randomization occurred less than 12 hr after symptom onset, or if patients were hemodynamically unstable. Change in LVEF was the primary outcome of interest, with changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) analyzed as secondary endpoints. We retrieved five studies in which baseline and follow up LVEF data were available enrolling a total of 648 patients: 342 patients randomized to PCI and 306 to medical treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in LVEF changes over time favoring PCI (+3.1%, 95% CI +1.0 to +5.2, P = 0.0004). In addition, there were statistically significant differences changes in both LVEDVI (-5.1 mL in favor of PCI, 95% CI of -9.4 to -0.8, P = 0.020) and LVESVI (-5.3 mL in favor in PCI, 95% CI of -8.3 to -2.4, P = 0.0005).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that late revascularization of an occluded IRA may improve left ventricular systolic function and remodeling, supporting the "open artery hypothesis". The reason why these changes have not resulted in clinical benefits in large clinical trials is subject to debate.

### Rationale and design of the long-term rIsk, clinical manaGement, and healthcare resource utilization of stable coronary artery dISease in post-myocardial infarction patients (TIGRIS) study [^db4d92f8]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The long-term progression of coronary artery disease as defined by the natural disease course years after a myocardial infarction (MI) is an important but poorly studied area of clinical research. The long-Term rIsk, clinical manaGement, and healthcare Resource utilization of stable coronary artery dISease in post-myocardial infarction patients (TIGRIS) study was designed to address this knowledge gap by evaluating patient management and clinical outcomes following MI in different regions worldwide. TIGRIS (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01866904) is a multicenter, observational, prospective, longitudinal study enrolling patients with history of MI 1 to 3 years previously and high risk of developing atherothrombotic events in a general-practice setting. The primary objective of TIGRIS is to evaluate clinical events (time to first occurrence of any event from the composite cardiovascular endpoint of MI, unstable angina with urgent revascularization, stroke, or death from any cause), and healthcare resource utilization associated with hospitalization for these events (hospitalization duration and procedures) during follow-up. Overall, 9225 patients were enrolled between June 2013 and November 2014 and are being followed in 369 different centers worldwide. This will allow for the description of regional differences in patient characteristics, risk profiles, medical treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization. Patients will be followed for up to 3 years. Here we report the rationale, design, patient distribution, and selected baseline characteristics of the TIGRIS study. TIGRIS will describe real-world management, quality of life (self-reported health), and healthcare resource utilization for patients with stable coronary artery disease ≥ 1 year post-MI.

### Long-term mortality, cardiovascular events, and bleeding in stable patients 1 year after myocardial infarction: a Danish nationwide study [^77b2593e]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) has declined substantially in several populations during the past decades. Concomitantly, important advances have been made in risk factor management and delivery of care for MI, leading to improvements in short- and long-term prognosis. Despite these developments, the global burden of coronary artery disease remains high. Due to the improved survival, patients with stable disease post-MI represent an increasingly important and prevalent population. The 1 year mark represents an important timepoint as patients who are considered stable have often left specialist care to be managed in the primary care setting. Notably, this is also when dual antiplatelet therapy is most often withdrawn. Worryingly, prior data have suggested that the long-term risk of cardiovascular events remains persistently high, even in patients with stable disease 1 year after MI.

Because previous studies have mainly focused on outcomes immediately following MI, there is a lack of available data regarding the developments in post-MI prognosis in the increasingly important and prevalent population of patients with stable disease. It is unclear whether they remain a high-risk population following the general improvements in treatment and risk. Finally, contemporary data on prognosis in this population are necessary to aid patient-physician discussions, to guide allocation of resources to public health-level secondary prevention efforts, to determine the need for continued specialist care, and to inform future clinical trials. Thus, using Danish registries, we investigated developments in long-term post-MI outcomes in a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized from 2000 to 2017 who were alive and event-free at 1 year after index MI, with follow-up conducted through January 2022.

### Late medical versus interventional therapy for stable ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^a80f881d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, but timely reperfusion is known to result in dramatically improved patient outcomes. As many as 40% of patients with STEMI, however, present late after symptom onset, which reduces the likelihood of them receiving reperfusion therapy. The past two decades have been plagued with controversy regarding the relative benefits of reperfusion therapy after 12 h from symptom onset. Despite considerable data supporting late reperfusion and the 'late open-artery hypothesis', recent studies have demonstrated a lack of benefit with late reperfusion. Moreover, advances in the medical management of STEMI have dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality, further challenging the need for more-invasive techniques. Numerous questions have arisen regarding the appropriate management and risk stratification of asymptomatic post-STEMI patients who present late after symptom onset. In light of recent data, we present a Review of late reperfusion in STEMI, specifically highlighting the effects of current medical therapies, risk-stratification techniques, and indications for the use of late reperfusion over medical management.

### Fractional flow reserve-guided management in stable coronary disease and acute myocardial infarction: recent developments [^21b69d38]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a whole cardiac cycle pressure-derived index of the maximum achievable blood flow in a coronary artery with a stenosis expressed as a ratio of maximum achievable blood flow if that artery were normal. Fractional flow reserve is a means of assessing the physiological significance of a coronary artery stenosis. Some of the most important clinical trials involving patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have assessed and confirmed the validity of FFR as a predictor of outcome. Fractional flow reserve citations in biomedical journals are increasingand FFR-guided management in patients with stable CAD now has Class I and Class IIa guideline recommendations.

We consider recent studies clarifying further the role of FFR in patients with stable CAD and myocardial infarction (MI). We focus on research published from 2013 to the present, whilst also citing relevant landmark publications. We have searched databases, i.e. PUBMED and registries, i.e. using the following key words: 'fractional flow reserve', 'coronary physiology', 'diagnostic', 'stable coronary disease', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'myocardial infarction', 'observational study', and 'clinical trial' The results include an assessment of study quality criteria.

### Relation between late patency of the infarct-related artery, left ventricular function, and clinical outcomes after primary percutaneous intervention for acute myocardial infarction (CADILLAC trial) [^00bbc03a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The importance of sustained patency of the infarct-related artery after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction is controversial. We examined serial measures of left ventricular function and clinical outcomes in 280 patients with an initially occluded infarct artery in whom Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction trial grade 3 flow was achieved and routine follow-up angiography was performed 7 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Reocclusion of the infarct artery was associated with decreased event-free survival, and the degree of restenosis was an independent predictor of the lack in improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction over time.

### Complete revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel coronary artery disease: an updated meta-analysis of randomized trials [^bb4e36ba]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications for Clinical Practice

It is important that the results of these trials, and the current analysis, are not conflated with the treatment of stable angina, for which PCI should still generally be offered with the goal of alleviating symptoms. 25 Moreover, this analysis serves to further illustrate the marked differences between patients who have had STEMI and those who have stable angina or stable CAD. The 2 entities are pathophysiologically and biologically distinct and therefore require distinct therapeutic strategies.

Clinicians treating patients with STEMI and multivessel disease have, broadly, 3 different management strategies to choose from: stenting the infarcted artery only and leaving all residual disease to medical therapy (culprit‐only PCI), treating all appropriate stenoses at the time of STEMI (immediate complete revascularization), and treating the infarct‐related artery at the time of STEMI and tackling the residual disease during another procedure (staged complete revascularization).

We sought to investigate whether the timing of complete revascularization had an impact on clinical outcomes. Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate evidence of a significant interaction between the timing of intervention in our analysis; that is, there was a consistent treatment effect for complete revascularization versus infarct‐related artery PCI, regardless of the timing when complete revascularization was achieved. Furthermore, the largest RCT in the field to date (COMPLETE) had no immediate PCI arm (patients underwent PCI to achieve complete revascularization in a staged procedure, either during the hospital admission or as an outpatient within 45 days). A further analysis from the COMPLETE trial, initially presented at Transcatheter Therapeutics 2019 and published subsequently, 26 did not demonstrate a difference between complete revascularization during the index admission (median, 1 day), or after discharge from the hospital (median, 23 days), with a P value for interaction of 0.62 for the outcome of cardiac death or new MI.

### Persistent infarct-related artery occlusion is associated with an increased myocardial apoptosis at postmortem examination in humans late after an acute myocardial infarction [^0a204143]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Myocardial apoptosis persists beyond the acute phases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is associated with left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Infarct-related artery (IRA) patency is considered a favorable prognostic factor after AMI and may be associated with more favorable LV remodeling because of reduced apoptosis at the site of AMI. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of IRA status on apoptotic rate (AR) in the hearts of subjects dying late after AMI.

Methods and Results

We used colocalization for in situ end-labeling of DNA fragmentation and immunohistochemistry for caspase-3 to calculate the AR at time of death (12 to 62 days after AMI) in 16 hearts with persistently occluded IRAs and in 8 hearts with patent IRAs. No significant differences were found when comparing the clinical characteristics of the 2 groups. Occluded IRA was associated with significantly higher AR at site of infarction (25.8% [interquartile range 20.9% to 28.5%] versus 2.3% [interquartile range 0.6% to 5.0%], P < 0.001). This strong correlation between IRA occlusion and AR remained statistically significant even after correction for clinical characteristics such as sex, age, history of previous additional AMI or heart failure, transmural AMI, anterior AMI, fibrinolytic treatment, time from AMI to death, trauma as cause of death, and multivessel coronary disease (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

A significantly higher AR was associated with persistent IRA occlusion late post-AMI. These data may suggest that the post-AMI benefits observed with a patent IRA (the "open-artery hypothesis") may in part be due to reduced myocardial apoptosis.

### DECOPI (DEsobstruction COronaire en post-infarctus): a randomized multi-centre trial of occluded artery angioplasty after acute myocardial infarction [^15ce5e89]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether late recanalization of an occluded infarct artery after acute myocardial infarction is beneficial.

Methods and Results

Two hundred and twelve patients with a first Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) and an occluded infarct vessel were enrolled. After coronary and left ventricular contrast angiography, patients were randomized to percutaneous revascularization (PTCA, n = 109), carried out 2–15 days after symptom onset or medical therapy (n = 103). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, non-fatal MI, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. The majority had single-vessel disease and less than one-third had involvement of the left anterior descending artery. The use of pharmacological therapy was high in both groups. At six months, left ventricular ejection fraction was 5% higher in the invasive compared with the medical group (P = 0.013) and more patients had a patent artery (82.8% vs 34.2%, P < 0.0001). Restenosis was seen in 49.4% of patients in the PTCA group. At a mean of 34 months of follow-up, the occurrence of the primary endpoint was similar in the medical and PTCA groups (8.7% vs 7.3% respectively, P = 0.68), but the overall costs were higher for PTCA. The secondary endpoint combining the primary endpoint with admission for heart failure was also similar between groups (12.6% vs 10.1% in the medical and PTCA groups, respectively, P = 0.56).

Conclusions

Systematic late PTCA of the infarct vessel was associated with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction at six months, no difference in clinical outcomes, and higher costs than medical therapy. These results must be interpreted with caution given the small size and low risk of the population.

### Management of persistent angina after myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from the TRANSLATE-ACS study [^6d21b867]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, physicians may fail to recognize the importance of treating angina or the effectiveness of existing antianginal medications, as evidenced by consistent lack of treatment, even in the face of very frequent or persistent symptoms. Despite guidelines recommending use of at least 2 classes of antianginal medications (a β‐blocker plus 1 additional agent) for patients with chronic angina, 9 there is no evidence that non–β‐blocker antianginal medications reduce cardiovascular mortality or clinical events in the post‐MI setting. However, all 3 classes of non–β‐blocker antianginal medications increase exercise duration and time to electrocardiographic ischemia in patients with stable angina. 22, 23, 24, 25 We found that patients with angina have worse quality of life across multiple domains than those without angina, and antianginal medications may help patients increase activity level and exercise capacity, and, in turn, improve quality of life. 1, 26, 27 Angina is also the factor most strongly associated with hospitalization within the 12 months following an index MI. 2, 6, 28 Furthermore, there may be cost or logistical barriers to the prescription of ranolazine, which is not yet available in generic form; however, low rates of prescription of nitrates and calcium channel blockers argue against cost being a major driver of this finding. Lastly, treatment inertia may be playing a role: Among patients with angina over the entirety of the study period, those who were treated with a non–β‐blocker antianginal medication at the time of their index MI discharge were 30‐fold more likely to take antianginal medications at any point than those who were not treated with a non–β‐blocker antianginal medication at the time of index MI discharge.

Variability in practice between clinicians suggests room for improvement in angina management, perhaps by addressing the communication gap between patients and providers. In 1 single‐center study, treating patients with angina in a dedicated "angina clinic" with monthly visits and scripted questions regarding angina severity and activity level resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in angina frequency and quality of life compared with usual care. 29 Provider education strategies to enhance patient–physician communication and improve angina management are needed, perhaps especially for younger and female patients, who are more likely to report angina at 6 weeks and persistent angina at 12 months, and are less likely to receive medical anti‐anginal therapy.

Conservative approach: acute percutaneous coronary intervention of the infarct-related artery alone (followed by medical therapy unless recurrent ischaemia occurs)

Other studies reported better outcomes with a more conservative strategy of p-PCI only on the IRA in the acute phase (Table 2). The study of Corpus et al.described significantly higher risk of re-infarction (13.0 vs. 2.8%, P < .001) and even of repeat revascularization (25 vs. 15%, P = 0,007) among 506 patients when treated by multi-vessel PCI (152 patients) when compared with IRA-only PCI (354 patients).

Table 2
Infarct-related artery culprit lesions alone then monitor for ischaemia

The New York State PCI Registryreported that in haemodynamically stable patients with multi-vessel disease, acute phase multi-vessel PCI results in an increased in-hospital mortality (2.4%) when compared with IRA-only PCI (0.9%, P = 0,04). On the contrary, patients undergoing staged multi-vessel PCI within 60 days after the index procedure had a significantly lower 12-month mortality rate than patients undergoing culprit vessel PCI only (1.3 vs. 3.3%, P = 0.04).

### Occluded artery trial (OAT) (OAT) [^a4c89c28]. ClinicalTrials (2000). Low credibility.

The benefits of establishing early coronary reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction have now been unequivocally established. However, current pharmacologic strategies fail to achieve effective reperfusion in 30 percent or more of patients, and many patients with occluded infarct arteries do not meet current criteria for use of these agents. Early angioplasty, an effective reperfusion method, is available to a small proportion of potentially eligible US acute MI patients. Hence a substantial number of acute MI patients pass the time when reperfusion therapy has any documented benefit with a persistently closed infarct vessel. Several lines of experimental and clinical evidence suggest that late reperfusion of these patients could provide clinically significant reductions in mortality and morbidity. Clinical outcomes will be compared using an intention-to-treat analysis.

The primary composite endpoint is mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for NYHA Class IV congestive heart failure over a three year follow-up. Individual components of the study composite primary endpoint will be compared in the two treatment arms, as will the medical costs of the two treatments and the health-related quality of life. The cost-effectiveness of percutaneous revascularization will be assessed in the study population.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 — STEMI infarct artery revascularization, Class 2a and Class 3: No Benefit guidance: Class 2a (B-R): In patients with STEMI who are treated with fibrinolytic therapy, angiography within 3 to 24 hours with the intent to perform PCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. Class 2a (B-NR): In patients with STEMI who are stable and presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, PCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. Class 2a (B-NR): In patients with STEMI in whom PCI is not feasible or successful, with a large area of myocardium at risk, emergency or urgent CABG can be effective as a reperfusion modality to improve clinical outcomes. Class 2a (C-EO): In patients with STEMI complicated by ongoing ischemia, acute severe heart failure, or life-threatening arrhythmias, PCI can be beneficial to improve clinical outcomes, irrespective of time delay from MI onset. Class 3: No Benefit (B-R): In asymptomatic stable patients with STEMI who have a totally occluded infarct artery > 24 hours after symptom onset and are without evidence of severe ischemia, PCI should not be performed.

Fibrinolytic-treated STEMI antiplatelet dosing and PCI alternatives — In CLARITY-TIMI 28, adding clopidogrel to aspirin in STEMI patients who were < 75 years and received fibrinolytic therapy reduced the odds of an occluded infarct-related artery and the 30-day composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. In COMMIT among suspected myocardial infarction (93% STEMI, 54% fibrinolytic-treated) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg/day (without a loading dose) significantly lowered the composite of death, reinfarction, or stroke and mortality alone, with no significant excess in bleeding versus placebo. Based on the design of these trials, when administered concurrently with fibrinolytic therapy, clopidogrel is recommended to be administered with a loading dose (300 mg, then 75 mg daily) for patients < 75 years of age and starting without a loading dose (75 mg daily) for patients ≥ 75 years of age. For patients treated with a fibrinolytic agent who undergo subsequent PCI, either clopidogrel or ticagrelor (age < 75 years, within 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) or prasugrel (> 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) are alternatives to support PCI. In a trial of 3799 fibrinolytic-treated STEMI patients, 89% of whom also received clopidogrel, ticagrelor initiated at a median of 11.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.8–18.2 hours) after fibrinolysis was noninferior to clopidogrel for major bleeding.

PPCI in STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals — For patients with STEMI presenting ≤ 12 hours after symptom onset, PPCI should be performed with a goal of FMC to device activation of ≤ 90 minutes, or ≤ 120 minutes in patients requiring hospital transfer, to improve survival (COR 1; LOE A). In patients with ACS and cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel by PCI or CABG is indicated to improve survival, irrespective of time from symptom onset (COR 1; LOE B-R). In patients with STEMI presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes (COR 2a; LOE B-NR). In patients with STEMI presenting > 24 hours after symptom onset with the presence of ongoing ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes (COR 2a; LOE C-LD). In patients who are stable with STEMI who have a totally occluded infarct-related artery > 24 hours after symptom onset and are without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe HF, or life-threatening arrhythmia, PCI should not be performed due to lack of benefit (COR 3: No Benefit; LOE B-R).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) timing and comparative therapy — PPCI is the recommended reperfusion therapy in patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms when performed ≤ 90 minutes (FMC–to–first-device activation) or ≤ 120 minutes in transfer patients to improve survival. PPCI is superior to fibrinolytic therapy, which is used when the patient is in a non–PCI-capable hospital and transfer time to a PCI-capable hospital is anticipated to be > 120 minutes. The benefit of PPCI begins to diminish for those > 12 hours from symptom onset, but there appears to be continued benefit for PPCI through approximately 24 hours. In stable asymptomatic patients, with an occluded artery > 48 hours after symptom onset, routine PCI has not been shown to be beneficial in the absence of ongoing ischemia. However, coronary revascularization should be considered for patients with late presentations with continued signs and symptoms of ischemia, including cardiogenic shock, acute severe HF, persistent angina, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Radial access for PCI has reduced rates of bleeding, decreased access site bleeding, decreased need for transfusion, and reduced acute kidney injury when compared with femoral access.

### Predictors of 30-day mortality in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction despite a patent infarct artery [^eb5394ad]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about predictors of survival in patients with persistent shock following acute myocardial infarction (MI) despite a patent infarct artery.

Methods

We examined data from TRIUMPH, a multicenter randomized clinical trial of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-N(G)-monomethyl-arginine, in patients with persistent vasopressor-dependent cardiogenic shock complicating acute MI at least 1 hour after established infarct-related artery patency. Patients who died within 30 days were compared with those who survived. Continuous variables were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum and categorical variables using the chi(2) test. Prespecified baseline variables were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to predict mortality. A second model incorporating baseline vasopressors and dosages and a third model including change in systolic blood pressure at 2 hours were also developed. Bootstrapping was used to assess the stability of model variables.

Results

Of 396 patients, 180 (45.5%) died within 30 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), measured on vasopressor support, and creatinine clearance were significant predictors of mortality in all models. The number of vasopressors and norepinephrine dose were also predictors of mortality in the second model, but the latter was no longer significant when change in SBP at 2 hours was added as a covariate in the third model.

Conclusions

The SBP, creatinine clearance, and number of vasopressors are significant predictors of mortality in patients with persistent vasopressor-dependent cardiogenic shock following acute MI despite a patent infarct artery. These prognostic variables may be useful for risk-stratification and in selecting patients for investigation of additional therapies.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — scope and applicability — excludes recommendations for patients with AF around surgical or invasive procedures, at presentation with acute stroke, with prosthetic heart valves, or who are pregnant; recommendations apply to persistent and permanent AF and to PAF but not to a single, transient, self-limited AF episode associated with acute illness. For patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease, intracoronary stent placement, or recent ACS (section 3.1–3.3), the effect of treatment options on nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was also considered.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with multivessel disease (MVD) — complete revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has shown benefit versus culprit-only strategies in randomized trials. PRAMI randomized 465 patients with STEMI and MVD to complete revascularization versus culprit artery only revascularization, and the trial was stopped early due to a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint with complete revascularization. The COMPLETE trial randomized 4041 patients with STEMI and significant MVD to staged PCI of the non–infarct-related artery (performed up to 45 days post MI) versus culprit vessel–only revascularization, and at a median follow-up of 3 years multivessel PCI reduced cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI) and the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemia-driven revascularization. Angina-related quality of life improved with multivessel PCI, and a meta-analysis found reduced cardiovascular death in patients with STEMI; however, a meta-analysis across trials did not suggest any differential benefit for complete revascularization when guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR) versus angiography. The benefits of complete revascularization with multivessel PCI should not be extrapolated to patients with disease more suited to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery because they were excluded from these trials.

### Long-term mortality, cardiovascular events, and bleeding in stable patients 1 year after myocardial infarction: a Danish nationwide study [^b6033ace]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Future perspectives and clinical implications

Continuous successful real-world implementation of evidence-based treatments from clinical trials remains key to improve long-term prognosis after MI, also in stable patients. In Denmark, guideline implementation has largely been driven by the Danish Society of Cardiology. The 'National Treatment Guidelines' are peer-reviewed and published regularly, based on endorsements of ESC guidelines. The high implementation of guideline recommendations in Denmark may also be linked to a tradition for research with importance for clinical practice. For example, DANAMI-2 led to the national implementation of primary PCI as first-line treatment of ST-elevation MI in 2003. Of note, statin use increased from an already high level during the early part of our study following the landmark trials of the 90s, likewise with dual antiplatelet therapy following the landmark trials of the early 2000s. Besides this, our data seem to indicate that efforts in additional areas are needed to further improve outcomes, as use of established treatments had reached a stably high level. Newer treatments such as anti-inflammatory treatments and proprotein-convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9-i) may play a role in targeting residual risk. Furthermore, non-cardiac comorbidities such as kidney disease, cancer, and diabetes were gradually more prevalent in our population, and comorbidities and non-cardiac outcomes may represent an increasingly important challenge in the management of the stable post-MI population. Finally, more focus is warranted on the role of cardiac rehabilitation and quality of life interventions considering the improved clinical outcomes for stable post-MI patients shown in our study. Another important consideration is, that treatments established in previous eras may need reevaluation to determine their efficacy in contemporary populations with lower a priori risk. An example of this the DANBLOCK trial that will assess the effect of beta blockers in an acute MI population without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Also, increasing evidence suggests similar ischaemic benefits of shorter compared with longer durations of antiplatelet therapy, which may lead to improvements in bleeding risk management for patients with MI in the future. However, the reported bleeding risk in our population was so low, that it approached that of the background population, implying that it may be difficult to additionally reduce bleeding risk in these patients. As the prognosis varied markedly between stable and non-stable post-MI patients in our study, identifying high-risk patients through individual risk stratification, and applying personalized treatment strategies may be the key to further improve long-term outcomes while reducing the risk of adverse effects.

### Effects of percutaneous coronary intervention on death and myocardial infarction stratified by stable and unstable coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7f36eb4b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis shows that for unstable CAD subsets, PCI reduces all-cause mortality by 16%, cardiovascular mortality by 31%, and MI by 26%. In contrast, PCI had no impact on these end points in patients with stable CAD. Our analysis incorporates results from 2 large, contemporary RCTs examining the role of PCI in different scenarios of CAD: the COMPLETE trial for multivessel disease in STEMI and the ISCHEMIA trial in stable CAD.

Effect of PCI in Varying Clinical Syndromes

PCI is established to have a clear benefit in mortality over fibrinolysis, which itself almost halves the mortality of patients with STEMI. There is, therefore, no doubt over the survival benefit of primary PCI at the time of presentation with STEMI. The utility of PCI in other clinical syndromes, however, has been controversial. Outside the context of an ongoing STEMI lies not a simple unitary entity but a broad clinical spectrum.

As the years have passed and technology evolved, there has been an increasingly sophisticated categorization of patients between these groups. For example, in the first decades of angioplasty, a patient who had survived a STEMI to discharge and had subsequently been found to have a positive exercise test would be considered to have stable CAD, in much the same way as a patient with a several year-history of exertional angina. Modern practice, however, would be to consider the unrevascularized post-MI patient as requiring urgent angiography and revascularization if indicated. Doctors in current practice can certainly gain from trials of yesteryear but can do this best when trial patients are contextualized in the relevant part of the modern view of the clinical spectrum. This meta-analysis lays out this context simply and underlines the importance of placing patients in the correct categorization when deciding on whether they may benefit from PCI.

There is no evidence that PCI reduces mortality, cardiovascular mortality or MI in patients who have true stable CAD. Patients who have suffered an MI, however, do derive benefit from PCI. This grouping includes patients with NSTEACS, patients who have been discharged after an unrevascularized MI and also patients who have had PCI for the culprit artery in a STEMI, but who have residual coronary disease. It should be noted that the unrevascularized post-MI cohort is a group of trials from a time when STEMI was routinely managed with fibrinolysis and without angiography.

Our analysis underlines that these patients, who have had an unstable event, are distinct, and have specific therapeutic needs.

### Predicting risk of cardiovascular events 1 to 3 years post-myocardial infarction using a global registry [^3d9b43ce]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many low‐risk patients with stable coronary disease following myocardial infarction (MI) continue to live unencumbered by recurrent cardiovascular events, while high‐risk patients may benefit from more intensive medical therapy.

Established risk scores exist for patients with MI both from admission 1, 2 and from discharge, 3, 4 but risk prediction tools for longer‐term management of patients with stable disease following MI are lacking. The long‐Term rIsk, clinical manaGement and healthcare Resource utilization of stable coronary artery dISease in post‐myocardial infarction patients (TIGRIS) prospective registry evaluated a large representative group of patients recruited 1 to 3 years post‐MI. 5

Given the recent availability of new therapies that can improve outcomes in these patients, 6, 7, 8 there is a need to understand the drivers of risk in this cohort so as to identify those at greatest absolute risk who are likely to sustain the greatest absolute benefit.

This article focuses on incidence of the composite primary endpoint (MI, unstable angina requiring revascularization, stroke, and all‐cause death) over 2 years, and characterizes any influence by baseline patient factors. Our goal was to develop a user‐friendly risk index incorporating readily available items, see how strongly it facilitated risk discrimination for the primary endpoint and for all‐cause death, and validate against an external population. Finally, we discuss how this risk index may be used in patients with stable coronary disease to determine those with relatively good prognosis and those at higher risk who may benefit from more intensive management.

### The truth and consequences of the COURAGE trial [^4527ddd5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has played an integral role in the therapeutic management strategies for patients who present with either acute coronary syndromes or stable angina pectoris. The COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial enrolled patients with chronic stable angina and at least 1 significant (≥ 70%) angiographic coronary stenosis who were randomly assigned to an initial treatment of either PCI in conjunction with optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy alone. Although the initial management strategy of PCI did not reduce the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or other major cardiovascular events, improvement in angina-free status and a reduction in the requirement for subsequent revascularization was observed. An in-depth analysis of the COURAGE trial design and execution is provided.

### Predicting risk of cardiovascular events 1 to 3 years post-myocardial infarction using a global registry [^f224e8e0]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Risk prediction tools are lacking for patients with stable disease some years after myocardial infarction (MI).

Hypothesis

A practical long-term cardiovascular risk index can be developed.

Methods

The long-Term rIsk, Clinical manaGement and healthcare Resource utilization of stable coronary artery dISease in post-myocardial infarction patients prospective global registry enrolled patients 1 to 3years post-MI (369 centers; 25 countries), all with ≥ 1 risk factor (age ≥ 65years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, second prior MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, or chronic non-end-stage kidney disease [CKD]). Self-reported health was assessed with EuroQoL-5 dimensions. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to determine key predictors of the primary composite outcome (MI, unstable angina with urgent revascularization [UA], stroke, or all-cause death) over 2years.

Results

The primary outcome occurred in 621 (6.9%) of 9027 eligible patients: death 295 (3.3%), MI 195 (2.2%), UA 103 (1.1%), and stroke 58 (0.6%). All events accrued linearly. In a multivariable model, 11 significant predictors of primary outcome (age ≥ 65years, diabetes, second prior MI, CKD, history of major bleed, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, cardiovascular hospitalization (prior 6 months), medical management (index MI), on diuretic, and poor self-reported health) were identified and combined into a user-friendly risk index. Compared with lowest-risk patients, those in the top 16% had a rate ratio of 6.9 for the primary composite, and 18.7 for all-cause death (overall c-statistic; 0.686, and 0.768, respectively). External validation was performed using the Australian Cooperative National Registry of Acute Coronary Care, Guideline Adherence and Clinical Events registry (c-statistic; 0.748, and 0.849, respectively).

Conclusions

In patients > 1-year post-MI, recurrent cardiovascular events and deaths accrue linearly. A simple risk index can stratify patients, potentially helping to guide management.

### Patient management following percutaneous coronary intervention [^c1a31f83]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

When determining type and duration of antiplatelet therapy post-PCI, secondary prevention of ischemic events should be balanced with bleeding risk. Recommendations for achieving this differ between patients with stable CAD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Among patients with stable CAD, recent evidence supports prescription of short duration (1–3 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, eg, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). In patients treated with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials found that short duration (1–3 months) DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor SAPT led to reduced bleeding events at 12 months post-PCI compared to 12 months of DAPT. There was no difference in stent thrombosis, all-cause death, MI, and stroke. An exploratory analysis showed short-duration DAPT followed by aspirin SAPT produced similar results. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends that short duration DAPT (1–3 months) with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy is reasonable in select patients post-PCI; recommendations from the 2024 ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes are similar.

### Late intervention after anterior myocardial infarction: effects on left ventricular size, function, quality of life, and exercise tolerance: results of the open artery trial (TOAT study) [^bc5c015c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to conduct a randomized trial comparing late revascularization with conservative therapy in symptom-free patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Background

In the absence of ischemia, the benefits of reperfusion late after AMI remain controversial. However, the possibility exists that an open infarct related artery benefits healing post AMI.

Methods

Of 223 patients enrolled with Q-wave anterior AMI, 66 with isolated persistent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were randomized to the following treatments: 1) medical therapy (closed artery group; n = 34) or 2) late intervention and stent to the LAD + medical therapy (open artery group; n = 32). The study was powered to compare left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume between the two groups 12 months post AMI.

Results

Late intervention 26 ± 18 days post AMI resulted in significantly greater LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes at 12 months than medical therapy alone (106.6 ± 37.5 mL vs. 79.7 ± 34.4 ml, p < 0.01 and 162.0 ± 51.4 mL vs. 130.1 ± 46.1 ml, p < 0.01, respectively). Exercise duration and peak workload significantly increased in both groups from 6 weeks to 12 months post AMI, although absolute values were greater in the open artery group. Quality of life scores tended to deteriorate during this time interval in the closed artery patients but remained unchanged in the open artery patients. Coronary angiography at 1 year documented a low incidence of intergroup cross-over (spontaneous recanalization in 19% and closure in 11%).

Conclusions

In the present study, recanalization of occluded infarct-related arteries in symptom-free patients approximately 1 month post AMI had an adverse effect on remodeling but tended to increase exercise tolerance and improve quality of life.

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^77ec84d9]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The more important differences, however, concern patients whose symptoms are well controlled on medical therapy. NICE recommends revascularisation (by CABG) to potentially improve prognosis only in patients with left main stem and/or proximal 3-vessel disease, whereas the ESC includes proximal left anterior descending artery disease among its indications for revascularisation to improve prognosis. The ESC also recommends that evidence of myocardial ischaemia is used to guide revascularisation decisions. By contrast, myocardial ischaemia is not seen as an indication for revascularisation by NICE, which recommends a randomised trial of interventional management versus continued drug treatment in people with stable angina and myocardial ischaemia on non-invasive functional testing, with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality as the primary endpoints. NICE also recommends that research is undertaken to clarify the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early revascularisation compared with continued drug treatment in patients with stable angina and multivessel disease (including left main stem disease) whose symptoms are controlled with optimal drug treatment.

These differences must be related to the respective guideline development group's interpretation of the available evidence. Two key questions are: (1) how important is it that the randomised trials which showed prognostic benefit from CABG predated widespread statin use? (2) do the observations that myocardial ischaemia is associated with an adverse prognosis, and that myocardial ischaemia can be reduced by myocardial revascularisation, justify myocardial revascularisation in the absence of significant symptoms? Certainly, the evidence to support 'ischaemia-guided' selection of stable patients for revascularisation is limited. In a recent meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials which included 4064 patients with evidence of myocardial ischaemia, 5-year rates of death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) were not significantly different between patients who were allocated to medical therapy plus PCI compared with medical therapy alone. Perhaps the results would have been different if FFR had been used to diagnose myocardial ischaemia? In FAME II, the only trial to randomise patients with a low FFR to PCI or no PCI, the rate of unplanned revascularisation was significantly reduced, but there was no reduction in death or MI in PCI-treated patients. It is a matter of opinion whether or not these data justify revascularisation in patients with ischaemia but with few symptoms.

Table V — Quality of life (QoL) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with medical therapy (MT) summarizes randomized trials with angina-free rates and QoL differences. In RITA-2, angina-free status was 65% PCI/ 47% MT (P < 0.05) at 1 year and QoL, better than MT for PCI at 3 months and 1 year but not at 3 years. In ACME (2-vessel disease), angina-free status was 53% PCI/36% MT (P = 0.09) at 6 months with QoL, similar for PCI and MT at 6 months. In COURAGE, angina-free status was 53% PCI versus 42% MT (P < 0.001) at 3 months; both groups improved from baseline and QoL, better for PCI than MT at 3 and 6 months but similar at 12 months. In OAT, angina-free status was 93% PCI / 88% MT (P = 0.03) at 24 months with QoL, better with PCI at 6 months but not at 12 months. Additional studies reported QoL, similar at 6 and 18 months for PCI and MT in AVERT, and QoL, better for PCI than MT at 12 months in MASS II.

### How to treat patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction and multi-vessel disease? [^69bbb471]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Over 50% of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients suffer multi-vessel coronary artery disease, which is known to be associated with worse prognosis. Treatment strategies used in clinical practice vary from acute multi-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), through staged PCI procedures to a conservative approach with primary PCI of only the infarct-related artery (IRA) and subsequent medical therapy unless recurrent ischaemia occurs. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. This review paper summarizes the international experience and authors' opinion on this clinically important question. Multi-vessel disease in STEMI is not a single entity and thus the treatment approach should be individualized. However, the following general rules can be proposed till future large randomized trials prove otherwise: (i) Single-vessel acute PCI should be the default strategy (to treat only the IRA during the acute phase of STEMI). (ii) Acute multi-vessel PCI can be justified only in exceptional patients with multiple critical (> 90%) and potentially unstable lesions. (iii) Significant lesions of the non-infarct arteries should be treated either medically or by staged revascularization procedures-both options are currently acceptable.

### Impact of national clinical guideline recommendations for revascularization of persistently occluded infarct-related arteries on clinical practice in the United States… [^4c4e91ca]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

The Occluded Artery Trial was a large, randomized controlled trial published in 2006 that demonstrated no benefit to routine percutaneous coronary intervention of persistently totally occluded infarct-related arteries identified a minimum of 24 hours after myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of OAT results and consequent change in guideline recommendations for PCI for treatment of persistently occluded IRAs. Methods We identified all patients enrolled in the CathPCI Registry, from 2005 to 2008, undergoing catheterization more than 24 hours after MI with a totally occluded native coronary artery and no major OAT exclusion criteria. We examined trends in monthly rates of PCI for occlusions after OAT publication and after guideline revisions.

Because reporting of diagnostic catheterizations was not mandatory, we examined trends among hospitals in the highest quartile for reporting of diagnostic procedures. The purpose of major clinical trials is to establish a scientific basis for clinical practice. However, few trials are subjected to rigorous impact analyses. Quiz Ref IDThe Occluded Artery Trial was a large, randomized controlled trial funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute testing routine percutaneous recanalization of persistently totally occluded infarct-related arteries identified a minimum of 24 hours after myocardial infarction. 1 No reduction in death, reinfarction, or class IV heart failure was observed. The crude rate of PCI for total occlusions declined significantly from 42. 4% prior to the OAT to
39. 9% after the OAT but before the guideline revisions, and to 38. 5% after the guideline revisions.

After adjustment using the generalized estimating equation, there was no difference in the monthly rate of PCI for occlusions after publication of the OAT. In conclusion, among this large cross-section of hospitals in the United States we found only modest evidence that the results of the OAT and its incorporation into major guideline revisions have influenced cardiology and interventional cardiology practice over the subsequent 1 to 2 years. Percutaneous coronary intervention of total occlusions identified greater than 24 hours after MI remains commonplace despite little evidence to support its use in stable patients and new clinical practice guidelines recommending against it.

Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) guidance notes that either ad hoc or delayed PCI is appropriate for symptom relief when patients are on optimal medical therapy, have symptoms limiting quality of life, have evidence of ischemia in the target artery by stress testing or fractional flow reserve (FFR), and have undergone informed consent; among SIHD patients, the appropriate use criteria give the highest ratings of appropriateness (8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 9) to those with the most severe symptoms and largest areas of myocardium at risk.

### Ten-year outcome of recanalization or medical therapy for concomitant chronic total occlusion after myocardial infarction [^c191250f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations of the study have to be acknowledged. First, this 10‐year follow‐up was not a prespecified analysis. The original study was powered to detect differences in LVEF and left ventricular end‐diastolic volume at 4‐month follow‐up and not for clinical end points. Second, patients did not routinely undergo follow‐up angiography. Therefore, the presence of asymptomatic reocclusions in the CTO PCI group is unknown, which could attenuate the treatment effect of CTO PCI. Third, angina and dyspnea were not measured with specialized questionnaires, but using the commonly used New York Heart Association and Canadian Cardiovascular Society class. Fourth, this study was not sham controlled; thus, a placebo effect of CTO PCI on symptom relief cannot be excluded. Although this placebo effect probably diminishes during 10 years of follow‐up, it remains important to acknowledge the potential impact on the interpretation of the treatment effect. The results of the ongoing ORBITA‐CTO trial (A Comparison of the Impact of CTO PCI versus Placebo on Angina in Patients with Background Optimal Medical Therapy; NCT05142215) will provide valuable insight into this common limitation of CTO intervention trials. Lastly, the inclusion period of this study was from November 2007 through April 2015, which effected the success rate of CTO PCI. The introduction of dedicated CTO PCI centers and operators in the past years, with specific training programs, as well as the hybrid approach, have resulted in higher success rate in contemporary studies investigating CTO PCI.

Conclusions

This is the longest follow‐up currently available of a cohort of patients randomized to CTO PCI or no‐CTO PCI in a stabilized post‐STEMI population. Our findings indicate that performing CTO PCI shortly after primary PCI for STEMI did not yield any prognostic benefit in terms of MACE, or overall mortality when compared with a medical therapy strategy. The increased cardiovascular mortality rate after CTO PCI warrants careful consideration before routinely performing this intervention shortly after STEMI. Despite the overall lack of clinical benefit in terms of events, there seems to be a potential improvement in symptom relief associated with CTO PCI, in terms of alleviating dyspnea. While awaiting long‐term outcomes from other CTO PCI trials, risk–benefit assessment should guide individual patient decisions, carefully weighing effective symptom relief against an elevated cardiovascular mortality risk.

### Impact of optimal medical therapy with or without percutaneous coronary intervention on long-term cardiovascular end points in patients with stable coronary artery disease (from the COURAGE trial) [^05a74610]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The main results of the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive DruG Evaluation (COURAGE) trial revealed no significant differences in the primary end point of all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or major secondary end points (composites of death/MI/stroke; hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes [ACSs]) during a median 4.6-year follow-up in 2,287 patients with stable coronary artery disease randomized to optimal medical therapy (OMT) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to assess the impact of PCI when added to OMT on major prespecified tertiary cardiovascular outcomes (time to first event), namely cardiac death and composites of cardiac death/MI, cardiac death/MI/hospitalization for ACS, cardiac death/MI/stroke, MI/stroke, or cardiac death/MI/ACS/stroke, during study follow-up. There were no significant differences between treatment arms for the composite of cardiac death or MI (15% in PCI + OMT group vs 14.2% in OMT group, hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33, p = 0.62) or in any of the major prespecified composite cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up, even after excluding periprocedural MI as an outcome of interest. Overall, cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes paralleled closely the primary and secondary composite outcomes of the trial as a whole. In conclusion, compared with an initial management strategy of OMT alone, addition of PCI did not decrease the incidence of major cardiovascular outcomes including cardiac death or the composite of cardiac death/MI/ACS/stroke in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

### Effects of percutaneous coronary intervention on death and myocardial infarction stratified by stable and unstable coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b45db384]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies were eligible if they randomized patients to PCI versus conservative therapy without PCI and they reported outcomes of mortality and MI. NSTEACS trials were only eligible if they compared invasive versus conservative strategies and not if they compared early versus late invasive strategies. For multivessel disease following STEMI, trials were eligible if they reported clinical outcome data following randomization to complete revascularization with PCI or culprit-only revascularization with medical therapy for the residual CAD. For NSTEACS, trials were included if they randomized patients to invasive or conservative therapy (as no trials made a distinction between PCI and CABG in this setting). For stable CAD, trials in which revascularization could be achieved by either PCI or coronary artery bypass graft were included, with results combined to invasive therapy, and compared with conservative therapy.

End Points

The primary end point is all-cause mortality. The secondary end points are cardiovascular mortality and MI, as prespecified by the individual trials included. We did not differentiate between periprocedural and spontaneous MI. The end points were assessed using at least 1-year follow-up if available, or using the primary publication of each study. Sensitivity analyses using the longest follow-up data available were also performed.

### Atrial fibrillation and clinical outcomes 1 to 3 years after myocardial infarction [^0746a9ca]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in 5% to 10% of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Approximately one in five strokes are caused by AF, although most AF-related strokes can be prevented with oral anticoagulants (OAC). The major hazard associated with OAC is bleeding, the risk of which is substantially increased when OAC is combined with antiplatelet therapy after MI.

AF is a well-established risk factor associated with considerable morbidity and mortality after MI. Patients with a history of prior MI and concomitant AF comprise an important group at heightened risk for cardiovascular events, including hospitalisations for heart failure, bleeding and mortality. Characteristics and outcomes of stable patients with prevalent or incident AF after recovery from MI are not well described. We therefore sought to describe characteristics, quality-of-life (QoL) measures, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of patients with prevalent or incident AF following MI using data from the TIGRIS (long T erm r I sk, clinical mana G ement and healthcare R esource utilization of stable coronary artery d IS ease) registry, which includes a unique international population with MI 1–3 years before enrolment.

### Eplerenone (Inspra) [^b11e210d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

The eplerenone post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS) was a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients clinically stable 3 to 14 days after an acute MI with LV dysfunction (as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%) and either diabetes or clinical evidence of HF (pulmonary congestion by exam or chest x-ray or S3). Patients with HF of valvular or congenital etiology, patients with unstable post-infarct angina, and patients with serum potassium > 5.0 mEq/L or serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL were to be excluded. Patients were allowed to receive standard post-MI drug therapy and to undergo revascularization by angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Patients randomized to INSPRA were given an initial dose of 25 mg once daily and titrated to the target dose of 50 mg once daily after 4 weeks if serum potassium was < 5.0 mEq/L. Dosage was reduced or suspended anytime during the study if serum potassium levels were ≥ 5.5 mEq/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

EPHESUS randomized 6,632 patients (9.3% U.S.) at 671 centers in 27 countries. The study population was primarily white (90%, with 1% Black, 1% Asian, 6% Hispanic, 2% other) and male (71%). The mean age was 64 years (range, 22 to 94 years). The majority of patients had pulmonary congestion (75%) by exam or x-ray and were Killip Class II (64%). The mean ejection fraction was 33%. The average time to enrollment was 7 days post-MI. Medical histories prior to the index MI included hypertension (60%), coronary artery disease (62%), dyslipidemia (48%), angina (41%), type 2 diabetes (30%), previous MI (27%), and HF (15%).

### Atrial fibrillation and clinical outcomes 1 to 3 years after myocardial infarction [^e9763ba7]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and myocardial infarction (MI) are commonly comorbid and associated with adverse outcomes. Little is known about the impact of AF on quality of life and outcomes post-MI. We compared characteristics, quality of life and clinical outcomes in stable patients post-MI with/without AF.

Methods/results

The prospective, international, observational TIGRIS (long Term rIsk, clinical manaGement and healthcare Resource utilization of stable coronary artery dISease) registry included 8406 patients aged ≥ 50 years with ≥ 1 atherothrombotic risk factor who were 1–3 years post-MI. Patient characteristics were summarised by history of AF. Quality of life was assessed at baseline using EQ-5D. Clinical outcomes over 2 years of follow-up were compared. History of AF was present in 702/8277 (8.5%) registry patients and incident AF was diagnosed in 244/7575 (3.2%) over 2 years. Those with AF were older and had more comorbidities than those without AF. After multivariable adjustment, patients with AF had lower self-reported quality-of-life scores (EQ-5D UK-weighted index, visual analogue scale, usual activities and pain/discomfort) than those without AF. CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2 was present in 686/702 (97.7%) patients with AF, although only 348/702 (49.6%) were on oral anticoagulants at enrolment. Patients with AF had higher rates of all-cause hospitalisation (adjusted rate ratio 1.25 [1.06–1.46], p = 0.008) over 2 years than those without AF, but similar rates of mortality.

Conclusions

In stable patients post-MI, those with AF were commonly undertreated with oral anticoagulants, had poorer quality of life and had increased risk of clinical outcomes than those without AF.

### Optimal medical therapy with or without PCI for stable coronary disease [^739cb01e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

The study COURAGE was published by Boden WE and colleagues in 2007 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease. In the COURAGE study, the trial question was: what is the role of PCI as an initial management strategy in patients with stable coronary artery disease? In the COURAGE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the COURAGE study, the population was: 2287 patients (340 female, 1947 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had objective evidence of myocardial ischemia and significant coronary artery disease. The key exclusion criteria were severe angina, a markedly positive stress test, refractory HF, cardiogenic shock, ejection fraction < 30%, or revascularization within 6 months. In the COURAGE study, the interventions were: n = 1149 PCI (plus optimal medical therapy) n = 1138 medical therapy (optimal medical therapy alone). In the COURAGE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 4.6 years follow-up (19% vs. 18.5%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27). In the COURAGE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, myocardial infarction and stroke (20% vs. 19.5%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27) No significant difference in hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (12.4% vs. 11.8%; HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.37) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (13.2% vs. 12.3%; HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.43). In the COURAGE study, the conclusion was: in patients who had objective evidence of myocardial ischemia and significant coronary artery disease, PCI was not superior to medical therapy with respect to the rate of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 4.6 years follow-up.

6 LIMITATIONS

There are several limitations to this study. First, this is a retrospective observational study in a single center. Therefore, a limited number of patients were included. Second, the selection of CTO‐PCI or not and the timing of CTO‐PCI after IRA PCI is left to the preferences of patients and doctors. Therefore, the potential for selection bias cannot be excluded. Third, the myocardial viability test was not routinely performed, and potential imbalances of the amount of viable myocardium may influence the clinical outcomes.

### Heart muscle viability and remodeling in individuals post-heart attack… [^1bf97dcb]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

Heart Muscle Viability and Remodeling in Individuals Post-Heart AttackClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease is a major health problem in the United States. It is estimated that in 2003, more than 600, 000 Americans had a new heart attack, and more than 400, 000 experienced a recurrent heart attack. Up to 40% of individuals with a new or recurrent heart attack will show a complete occlusion, or blocking, of the IRA on follow-up angiography. Many people with an occluded IRA post-heart attack are at risk for progressive LV remodeling in the heart, which can lead to congestive heart failure. The NHLBI-funded OAT study is testing the hypothesis that opening an occluded IRA 3 to 28 days following a heart attack will reduce the composite endpoint of mortality, recurrent heart attack, and New York Heart Association class IV heart failure over a three-year follow-up period. OAT has enrolled approximately 1, 100 participants at 240 centers in 24 countries.

Among the mechanisms proposed to explain the benefit of late revascularization, recovery of LV function and attenuation of LV remodeling due to restoration of blood flow to viable myocardium, or heart muscle, is the most plausible. DESIGN NARRATIVE: An estimated 200 individuals who have had a heart attack will be enrolled in this study. The primary aims of this study are the following: 1) to test the hypothesis that participants who demonstrate preservation of viability within the infarct zone will have less progressive remodeling compared to participants exhibiting predominant infarct, and 2) to test the hypothesis that preservation of viability will modify the treatment effect of randomization to late revascularization in participants with an occluded IRA 3 to 28 days after the heart attack. All participants will have resting gated Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT imaging at baseline, and again 1 year later.

Parameters of baseline viability within the infarct zone, and serial measures of LV volume change and function will be centrally assessed by the Cardiac Imaging Core Laboratory at Tufts Medical Center. The major study endpoint to address the hypotheses will be serial change in LV end-diastolic volume, based on the degree of preservation of viability within the defined infarct zone. Sample size calculations will be based on data evaluated by the same group from a similar number of participants studied at a similar number of clinical sites.

### Ffr-gUidance for compLete non-cuLprit REVASCularization (FULL REVASC) [^2f7683cb]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

However, recent small scale randomised controlled trials indicate that full revascularization of these non-infarct related arteries during the index procedure is superior to initial conservative treatment. Fractional flow reserve, a method used to determine ischemia-inducing lesions, has been shown to be superior to angiography-guided PCI in stable angina. Objective and methods: To test the hypothesis that a strategy of systematic complete revascularization with FFR-guided PCI following STEMI/very high risk NSTEMI leads to improved clinical outcomes compared to initial conservative management of non-culprit lesions. The trial is a prospective international multicentre registry-based randomized controlled trial with combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality, or non-fatal MI, or unplanned revascularization at a minimum follow-up of 2–3 years.

Recent small scale randomised controlled trials have however produced results which suggest that in cases where there is anatomically significant non-culprit multi-vessel disease full revascularization of these non-infarct related arteries during the index procedure or at least during the same hospitalization is superior to initial conservative treatment. Since these studies were so small and also go against earlier observational studies and current guidelines it is therefore difficult to draw any conclusions on how to treat this patient group in the optimal way to reduce mortality. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether in patients with STEMI/rescue PCI/risk evaluation following successful thrombolysis/very high risk NSTEMI FFR-guided PCI of non-culprit lesions during the index hospital admission will improve cardiovascular outcomes compared to an initially conservative approach of non-culprit lesions.

The study aim is powered statistically for the combined primary endpoint of total mortality and myocardial infarction at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The sample size calculation is based on the patients with 2- or 3-vessel disease in the TASTE trial. This group constitutes 3138 patients, of which 208 died and 312 had a composite event of death or rehospitalization with myocardial infarction within 1 year. 4052 patients would give 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% at one year in the composite of all-cause death and myocardial infarction, for FFR-guided non-culprit PCI against conservative treatment.

PCI case selection and emergency transfer: Under case selection, operators should avoid intervention in patients with " > 50% diameter stenosis of left main artery proximal to infarct-related lesion, especially if the area in jeopardy is relatively small and overall LV function is not severely impaired", "Long, calcified, or severely angulated target lesions at high risk for PCI failure with TIMI flow grade 3 present during initial diagnostic angiography", "Lesions in arteries other than the infarct artery (unless they appeared to be flow limiting in patients with hemodynamic instability or ongoing symptoms)", "Lesions with TIMI flow grade 3 in patients with left main or three-vessel disease where bypass surgery is likely a superior revascularization strategy compared with PCI", "Culprit lesions in more distal branches that jeopardize only a modest amount of myocardium when there is more proximal disease that could be worsened by attempted intervention", and "Chronic total occlusions". For special contexts, "The management of patients with STEMI resuscitated from sudden cardiac death is complex, and decisions about the need for immediate PCI with or without therapeutic hypothermia or possible transfer to a tertiary facility for treatment should be individualized". Indications for emergency transfer for coronary bypass surgery include "High-grade left main or three-vessel coronary disease with clinical or hemodynamic instability after successful or unsuccessful PCI of an occluded vessel and preferably with IABP support" and "Failed or unstable PCI result and ongoing ischemia, with IABP support during transfer".

### 2023 AHA / ACC clinical performance and quality measures for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on performance measures [^4b2ebf2e]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). High credibility.

AHA/ACC coronary artery revascularization performance measure PM-11 — non-infarct artery revascularization in STEMI — tracks the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 y with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who are hemodynamically stable after culprit percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and undergo PCI of a significant non-infarct artery after primary PCI; in the COMPLETE trial, significant non‑culprit stenosis was defined as stenosis severity of > 70% (or 50%–69% with fractional flow reserve [FFR] ≤ 0.80) with diameter ≥ 2.5 mm amenable to successful PCI. The numerator is patients with multivessel CAD who are hemodynamically stable after successful primary PCI for STEMI who undergo staged PCI of non‑culprit artery(s), and the denominator is patients age ≥ 18 y with multivessel CAD who are hemodynamically stable after successful primary PCI for STEMI and have non‑culprit vessels suitable for PCI. Denominator exclusions are patient refusal, leaving against medical advice, failed primary PCI, or death during admission, with denominator exceptions for documented medical reasons including acute renal insufficiency, active bleeding, coronary anatomy not amenable to further revascularization, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for non‑infarct arteries, do not resuscitate status, or persistent instability after primary PCI of the culprit stenosis. The measurement period uses the index procedure or hospitalization with observation across a 12‑mo period, and data sources include EHR data, administrative data/claims (inpatient or outpatient; expanded multiple sources), and paper medical records. Rationale notes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing benefit for staged PCI versus culprit‑only PCI in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and the COMPLETE trial showed a 3‑y reduction in the composite of death or myocardial infarction (MI) when staged PCI of the non‑infarct artery was performed within 45 d of STEMI; although the COMPLETE trial specifies a 45‑d window, this timeframe is not included in the 2021 guideline recommendation. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline states that in selected hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and multivessel disease, after successful primary PCI, staged PCI of a significant non‑infarct artery stenosis is recommended to reduce the risk of death or MI (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A).

Early and successful restoration of myocardial perfusion after a ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most effective way to reduce the final infarct size and improve clinical outcomes. It is generally well‐accepted that primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the preferred reperfusion strategy for all STEMI patients when it can be performed within the guideline‐recommended time frame at PPCI‐capable centers. 1, 2 However, PPCI is not universally available, and delay in performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is common in clinical practice, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 3, 4, 5 Pharmacoinvasive strategy, fibrinolysis combined with rescue PCI (in case of failed fibrinolysis) or routine early (3–24 hours) invasive strategy (in case of successful fibrinolysis), has been proposed as a therapeutic option for STEMI patients when timely PPCI is not feasible. 1, 2 However, there is a potential time delay between clinical patency and complete myocardial perfusion in pharmacoinvasive strategy. Successful clinical reperfusion does not mean a good flow grade of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) and tissue perfusion. Studies have revealed that the proportion of TIMI flow grade < 3 confirmed by coronary angiography in patients with clinical patency was as high as 50%. 6, 7, 8 Moreover, the re‐occlusion of the infarct‐related artery (IRA) and recurrent ischemia rate in clinical patency patients while waiting for PCI is high (nearly 30%). 9 The optimal timing of coronary angiography after fibrinolysis is uncertain. 10

Synopsis of revascularization in stable chronic coronary disease — The management of patients with CCD and stable angina is 3-fold: relief of symptoms, prevention of nonfatal events such as MI, and improving long-term survival. Revascularization results in a greater improvement in angina and QOL than does medical therapy alone and, among appropriate patients with CCD, lowers the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, and urgent revascularization, but the effect of revascularization on improving survival in patients with CCD is more nuanced, with multiple studies and meta-analyses confirming an overall null effect on all-cause death for CCD, with few exceptions.

CLTI trial follow-up — A "follow-up period of at least 2 to 3 years is strongly recommended" because "it is unlikely that 6-month or 12-month follow-up periods will provide adequate assessment of clinical durability", and timing of end point collection "will depend on the study aims, design, and budget".

Cardiogenic shock complicating acute coronary syndromes — revascularization decreases mortality, and ad hoc PCI of the infarct artery is appropriate; ad hoc PCI of more than one lesion may be appropriate if the culprit cannot be identified with certainty. Among patients with hemodynamic stabilization after PCI of the infarct artery, ad hoc PCI of noninfarct artery stenoses correlates with poorer outcomes; if shock persists despite PCI of the culprit lesion, ad hoc PCI of nonculprit lesions may be helpful if there are flow limiting at rest and supply a large risk region.

Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis — aspirin allocation in randomized trials across primary and secondary prevention — reports that in the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs 0.57% control per year; P = 0.0001) but increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10% vs 0.07% per year; P < .0001). In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7% vs 8.2% per year; P < .0001), with reductions of about a fifth in total stroke (2.08% vs 2.54% per year; P = 0.002) and in coronary events (4.3% vs 5.3% per year; P < .0001). Absolute reductions in serious vascular events per 1000 were 36 in previous myocardial infarction, 38 in acute myocardial infarction, 36 in previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 9 in acute stroke, and 22 in other high-risk patients, and proportional reductions seemed similar for men and women.

### Harmonizing the paradigm with the data in stable coronary artery disease: a review and viewpoint [^7fab7784]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) trial, 1005 patients were randomized to angiographically guided PCI or PCI guided by an FFR < 0.80 (it is not clear why 0.75 was not used). FFR‐guided PCI was associated with fewer PCIs and a reduction in the combined end point of death, MI, or revascularization at 2 years. 65 Often overlooked, the FAME trial was the first study to demonstrate harm from unnecessary PCI in patients with stable CAD. It left unanswered where the line is drawn between necessary and unnecessary PCI.

The FAME 2 trial provided insight into where that line should be drawn. This unblinded trial randomized 888 patients with FFR < 0.80 to initial PCI with second‐generation drug‐eluting stents and medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. 16 There was no difference in death or MI between groups at a follow‐up of 2 years. 42 FAME 2 enrolled a very low‐risk population: there were only 6 deaths (1.3%) in the PCI group and 8 deaths (1.8%) in the medical therapy group, including only 3 cardiac deaths in each group at 2 years (0.7%). 40 In an effort to demonstrate some benefit of PCI on important end points, FAME 2 included a landmark analysis that excluded events that occurred in the first 7 days following randomization including periprocedural MI that can only occur in the PCI‐treated patients. By eliminating periprocedural MI from end point analysis, the authors showed a reduction of MI in the PCI group. 40 However, FAME 2 defined MI, including periprocedural MI, as CKMB > 10 times the upper limits of normal or > 5 times upper limits of normal with an associated occluded artery or new Q waves, a threshold clearly associated with increased 30‐day mortality. 63, 64

Stent thrombosis (ST) — definition, incidence, outcomes, and classification are described: ST is an acute or subacute thrombotic occlusion that usually presents as an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; the overall incidence of ST is 0.5% to 1.0% in the first year and 0.2% to 0.6% in every subsequent year, with lower rates for elective stent placement (0.3%-0.5%) but higher in acute coronary syndrome (3.4%); in contemporary practice, the observed mortality rate (~30%) is high, although studies with systematic autopsy confirmation suggest that it may be < 10%; stent thrombosis is classified by the Academic Research Consortium criteria with timing acute, subacute, early, late, and very late, defined as within 24 hours (acute), 24 hours to 30 days (subacute), 30 days to 1 year (late), and > 1 year (very late), and early ST is defined as occurring within 30 days; approximately 20% of patients with a first ST experience a recurrent ST episode within 2 years; and premature or patient-initiated termination of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), sometimes because of bleeding or preoperative concerns, is responsible for most cases of ST.

### Noninvasive detection of collateral flow to the infarct-related coronary artery in patients after myocardial infarction by Tl-201 tomographic imaging [^6108abad]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The determination of viability and perfusion within the infarct zone in post-myocardial infarction patients has both therapeutic and prognostic significance. Reversibility of thallium 201 uptake within the territory of the infarct-related coronary artery (IRA) as shown by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is associated with a jeopardized but viable myocardium. We aimed to test the hypothesis that for post-myocardial infarction patients undergoing Tl-201 stress-redistribution SPECT, a scintigraphic pattern of distal reversibility without proximal reversibility within a defect corresponding to the IRA territory is a marker of collateral flow to the occluded culprit artery.

Methods and Results

We assessed Tl-201 SPECT imaging results of 78 patients with IRA occlusion as demonstrated by angiography 7 ± 1 months after myocardial infarction. Angiography demonstrated the presence of collateral flow in 57 patients and its absence in 21 patients. Distal reversibility was present in 42 of the 57 patients with collateral flow (sensitivity, 74%) and was absent in 16 of the 21 patients without collateral flow (specificity, 76%). Collateral flow to the IRA was demonstrated in 42 of 47 patients with distal reversibility (group A) (positive predictive value, 89%) and absent in 16 of 31 patients with a fixed defect without reversibility (group B) (P < .001) (negative predictive value, 52%).

Conclusions

In patients after myocardial infarction, a Tl-201 SPECT redistribution pattern of distal reversibility without proximal reversibility within a defect in the IRA territory is a noninvasive marker of collateral flow to the culprit artery with a high positive predictive value that may provide valuable information on patient management. A larger prospective study in an unselected patient population is needed to further evaluate the clinical value of this marker.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^2f0a4ce6]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to perioperative management of antithrombotics, ACC/AHA/SCAI 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a shorter-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (1–3 months) with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy to reduce the risk of bleeding events in selected patients undergone PCI.
