## Question

Why do an ANA test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to order and interpret antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing in clinical practice, including when not to order it and what to do with positive results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the optimal testing method and titer thresholds. Next, I will review how to interpret positive results, including titer, pattern, and when to pursue extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) or anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) testing. After that, I need to check special populations and pitfalls, including children, older adults, and ANA-negative SLE. Finally, I will consider cost-effectiveness, repeat testing, and synthesize a practical algorithm with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because pretest probability drives everything here. ANA is a screening test with high sensitivity but poor specificity; therefore, it should be ordered only when there is a reasonable suspicion of a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) such as SLE, Sjögren's, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, or inflammatory myopathies, typically signaled by multisystem inflammatory features like photosensitive rash, inflammatory arthritis, cytopenias, serositis, or unexplained organ involvement [^117S9Umx] [^113bfRPo]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — widespread pain, fatigue, or isolated musculoskeletal complaints alone are not appropriate indications, and ordering ANA in those settings yields many false positives and low diagnostic yield [^113MEpFB] [^112xNQSS].

> I need to ensure I am using the right test method. The indirect immunofluorescence assay on HEp-2 cells remains the gold standard for ANA screening because it detects a broader spectrum of autoantibodies than most solid-phase assays; solid-phase assays can miss clinically relevant patterns and should be used cautiously or as adjuncts rather than replacements for IIF [^114eLiwi] [^11693bVX]. Wait, let me verify the titer threshold — most contemporary classification frameworks treat a titer of at least 1:80 as the entry point for considering SLE, balancing sensitivity and specificity, with higher titers improving specificity but reducing sensitivity [^112nBkjE] [^111FfXxZ].

> Next, I should review how to interpret a positive ANA. A positive result is not diagnostic by itself; it must be interpreted alongside clinical features and, when appropriate, followed by more specific autoantibody testing. I should double-check the titer: titers at or above 1:160 raise stronger suspicion, whereas low titers (for example, 1:40–1:80) are common in healthy individuals and often nonspecific, especially in older adults or those with infections or medications that can induce ANA [^112xNQSS] [^112SZvRo] [^113rfZHg] [^116oFZtM]. Let me consider the pattern too — homogeneous staining suggests anti-dsDNA or histone antibodies and is more typical of SLE, speckled patterns are less specific but may correlate with ENA reactivities, and nucleolar or centromere patterns point toward scleroderma spectrum disease; however, patterns alone are not disease-specific and should guide, not dictate, the differential [^116u5SK3] [^11138uKU]. But wait, what if the pattern is dense fine speckled (DFS70)? Isolated anti-DFS70 is common in healthy individuals and tends to lower the likelihood of SARD, so I should confirm this with specific testing when suspected to avoid unnecessary workups [^117QHf2V].

> I will now examine when to pursue ENA and anti-dsDNA testing. If the ANA is positive and clinical suspicion remains, I should order ENA to evaluate specificities such as SSA/Ro, SSB/La, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, and centromere, which help differentiate among SARDs; anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm are particularly supportive of SLE and carry more diagnostic weight than ANA alone [^113ZHKpZ] [^112HJL82]. Hold on, I should verify a common pitfall: ordering ENA panels indiscriminately or simultaneously with ANA in low-suspicion patients increases false positives and low-yield results; a stepwise approach anchored to a positive ANA and compatible clinical features is more cost-effective and clinically meaningful [^112PGT1D] [^1161FRkX].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with children. I should confirm that routine ANA screening for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain is discouraged in pediatrics because of high false-positive rates and low diagnostic yield; ANA is useful when SLE or MCTD is suspected, and high titers (for example, ≥ 1:640) are more informative than low titers, though even high titers are not diagnostic without compatible clinical features [^114t92Ww] [^114d6T7p]. Hmm, wait a minute — some pediatric cohorts show that higher titers associate with autoimmune diagnoses, but overlap with healthy children persists, reinforcing that history and examination trump serology in diagnosis [^113nzsFy] [^112wnHjB].

> I should also review considerations in older adults. ANA positivity becomes more prevalent with age even in healthy individuals, so low-titer positives are especially nonspecific in this group; interpretation should be conservative and driven by clinical context rather than serology alone [^113rfZHg] [^117BEZ5q]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not mean ANA is useless in older adults — it remains valuable when classic SARD features are present, but isolated positivity should not trigger extensive workups without supportive clinical evidence [^117S9Umx].

> But wait, what if the ANA is negative — does that exclude SLE? I need to ensure I do not overstate this. Truly ANA-negative SLE exists and is uncommon, with estimates around 2–5% in modern cohorts; therefore, a negative ANA substantially lowers the probability of SLE but does not absolutely rule it out when the clinical picture is compelling, prompting careful reassessment and, if necessary, repeat testing with a sensitive IIF method or alternative platforms in select cases [^112HJL82] [^114XjZ9i]. Let me reconsider the assay issue — some HEp-2 substrates or solid-phase methods may underdetect certain autoantibodies, so discordant clinical-serologic pictures warrant discussion with the laboratory and consideration of complementary testing strategies [^112HJL82] [^11693bVX].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness and repeat testing. Repeat ANA testing after a negative result rarely changes management and has a very low yield for new diagnoses, so routine retesting is not recommended unless the clinical picture evolves. Similarly, repeating ENA after an initial negative result seldom alters outcomes unless new clinical features arise [^114VGJwC] [^11256GV5]. I should double-check that this aligns with stewardship guidance — indeed, Choosing Wisely and subsequent implementation studies show that targeted education and feedback can reduce unnecessary ANA ordering without harming diagnostic yield, supporting judicious, context-driven testing [^115mokPy] [^116v7jbh].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. First, screen for SARD clinically using history and examination. If pretest probability is low, avoid ANA testing. Second, if suspicion is moderate to high, order ANA by IIF on HEp-2 and interpret the titer and pattern in clinical context. Consider specific autoantibody testing if ANA is positive and clinical features persist. Third, if ANA is negative but suspicion remains high, maintain vigilance and consider repeating ANA with a sensitive platform or pursuing targeted autoantibodies based on the leading differential, recognizing that ANA-negative SLE is rare but possible [^114eLiwi] [^117S9Umx] [^112HJL82]. Hold on, I should verify that this stepwise approach is supported — yes, multiple studies and guidelines endorse a tiered strategy to minimize low-yield testing while preserving diagnostic sensitivity where it matters [^1161FRkX] [^112PGT1D].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. ANA is a screening test with high sensitivity and low specificity. It should be ordered only when clinical suspicion for SARD is meaningful, interpreted in context, and followed selectively by more specific autoantibody testing. Low-titer positives are common in healthy individuals, especially with age. Repeat testing is generally low yield unless the clinical picture changes. Adhering to these principles reduces false positives, unnecessary referrals, and costs while preserving diagnostic accuracy where it counts [^112SZvRo] [^113rfZHg] [^114VGJwC].

The ANA test is used to **screen for autoimmune diseases** — especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^113ZHKpZ] — and to support the diagnosis of other connective tissue diseases (e.g. Sjögren's, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease) [^117BEZ5q] when clinical suspicion is high. It is **not a standalone diagnostic test** [^115Mm26w]; positive results must be interpreted in clinical context and confirmed with more specific autoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) [^116ANVmX] and clinical criteria [^113ZHKpZ]. Routine screening in low-suspicion settings is discouraged due to false positives and low predictive value [^113MEpFB] [^112xNQSS].

---

## Clinical indications for ANA testing

ANA testing is indicated when clinical features suggest an autoimmune connective tissue disease (CTD), including:

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: ANA is positive in ~95% of SLE [^117S9Umx]; a negative ANA makes SLE unlikely but does not exclude it [^112HJL82].

- **Other CTDs**: Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, and inflammatory myopathies [^117BEZ5q].

- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: ANA is part of the serologic profile supporting diagnosis [^111L1MSp].

- **Unexplained multisystem disease**: Fever, rash, arthritis, serositis, cytopenias, or organ involvement suggesting autoimmunity [^113bfRPo].

Routine screening in asymptomatic patients or those with nonspecific symptoms (e.g. fatigue, arthralgia) is **not recommended** due to low specificity and potential false positives [^113MEpFB] [^114t92Ww].

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

### Utility

- **High sensitivity**: ANA is highly sensitive for SLE, making it a useful screening test [^111FfXxZ].

- **Supportive diagnosis**: Positive ANA, especially at higher titers (≥ 1:160), increases suspicion for CTDs and guides further testing [^114hpoEV].

- **Classification criteria**: ANA positivity is an entry criterion in the 2019 EULAR/ACR SLE classification criteria [^113ZHKpZ].

---

### Limitations

- **Low specificity**: ANA positivity is common in healthy individuals (~12–20%) and in non-autoimmune conditions (e.g. infections, malignancies, medications) [^113jt3bc] [^116oFZtM].

- **False positives**: Low-titer ANA is frequent and can lead to misinterpretation if not correlated clinically [^116u5SK3].

- **Not diagnostic alone**: Positive ANA must be confirmed with specific autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) and clinical criteria [^116ANVmX] [^116UdRoD].

---

## Interpretation of ANA results

ANA results are reported by titer and pattern; interpretation should be **guided by clinical context**:

| **Titer** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| < 1:40 | Generally considered negative or low-positive; unlikely to indicate CTD |
| 1:40–1:80 | Weak positive; may be seen in healthy individuals or non-autoimmune conditions |
| ≥ 1:160 | More suggestive of CTD, especially if accompanied by clinical features |

---

Common **ANA patterns** and their associations include:

| **Pattern** | **Associated diseases** |
|-|-|
| Homogeneous | SLE, drug-induced lupus |
| Speckled | SLE, Sjögren's, MCTD |
| Nucleolar | Systemic sclerosis |
| Centromere | Limited systemic sclerosis (CREST) |
| Dense fine speckled (DFS70) | Often benign, isolated; reduces likelihood of CTD |

---

## Follow-up testing and clinical management

Positive ANA should prompt **targeted testing** for specific autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-ENA) and correlation with clinical findings [^116ANVmX]. Management is guided by the resulting clinical diagnosis and disease activity; repeat ANA testing is generally not recommended unless the clinical picture changes [^114t92Ww] [^113MEpFB].

---

## Conclusion

The ANA test is a **sensitive screening tool** for autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE, but it lacks specificity [^115Mm26w]. It should be ordered only when clinical suspicion for CTD is present, with results interpreted in context and confirmed by specific autoantibody testing and clinical criteria [^117BEZ5q]. Routine screening in low-suspicion settings is discouraged to avoid false positives and unnecessary interventions [^113MEpFB].

Initial serological testing should include determinations of antinuclear antibody (ANA) and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) in adults and ANA, SMA, and anti–liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1) in children, with consideration of additional autoantibody tests if warranted to secure the diagnosis. Diagnostically challenging cases should be reviewed by or referred to an experienced liver center prior to initiating therapy.

What should be done?

So what should be done with a positive ANA test? Our answer would be exemplified by the answer a local inhabitant gave when asked directions from place A to B by a foreign tourist: "I wouldn't be leaving from here!" In other words, it would be best if the ANA test had not been done in the first place! We would suggest that a positive ANA test can safely be ignored unless there are other suggestive clinical signs, and simple laboratory tests (such as a raised ESR or cytopenias) that point towards a diagnosis of lupus or similar connective tissue disease, particularly if the ANA titer is less than 1:640. Given the high false positive rate of ANA tests, a positive test cannot be used as confirmatory evidence that the child with a swollen joint has JIA, rather than some other serious condition such as septic arthritis, leukemia, or hemophilia. Similarly, symptoms such as fatigue and aches and pains in a child should not be ascribed to SLE simply because of a positive ANA test. It is much more likely that such a child has an idiopathic pain syndrome such as fibromyalgia or hypermobility. A negative ANA test is more useful than a positive one, as it does, for all practical purposes, exclude the diagnosis of SLE in a child.

What is needed is a cost-effectiveness study to evaluate whether the ANA test should be replaced by testing initially for anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA (anti-Sm, RNP, SSA and SSB) antibodies. Until that study is done, we would recommend that non-rheumatologists only do an ANA test if there is a fairly high probability (perhaps a 10+% chance) that a child's symptoms could be due to SLE or MCTD. If the test is positive at a titer of > 1:160 then it would be appropriate to order antibodies to dsDNA and ENA, with lower titers being ignored as well as complement levels.

We would strongly recommend that the ANA test is not ordered indiscriminately as part of "a rheumatologic work-up". This is not a new message. Other pediatric rheumatologists have pointed out in the literature that the ANA is a poor screening test and is being used inappropriately. It is our hope that a continued demonstration of these facts will gradually decrease its inappropriate use. The cost of inappropriate referrals, extra venipuncture, unnecessary expense, and increased parental and child anxiety is a considerable problem that pediatric rheumatologists see every day.

### Don't order ANA and other autoantibody testing on a child… [^114t92Ww]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The ANA has a high sensitivity for only one disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, but has very poor specificity for systemic lupus erythematosus and every other rheumatic disease. Therefore, it is not useful or indicated as a general screen of autoimmunity. A positive ANA may occur secondary to polyclonal activation of the immune system following an infection, or it may be positive without any identifiable reason/disease in up to 32% of the population. Limiting patients on which to order ANA would reduce unnecessary physician visits and laboratory expenses, as well as parental anxiety. "Lupus panels" and other similar panels should also not be ordered without concerns for specific autoimmune disease. Additionally, since the ANA may always be positive and may fluctuate in titer, it is not recommended to retest it unless there is some new clinical concern.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^113kKUDP]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the EULAR and the ACR jointly published new classification criteria that incorporated state-of-the-art knowledge about the role of serological findings in SLE. The working group employed sophisticated methodology. The new classification was meticulously derived from a carefully curated cohort of patients with lupus and non-lupus, and the initial publication included a carefully assembled validation cohort. The non-lupus subjects in this cohort had 'conditions mimicking SLE', and prior to both derivation and validation, all subjects were centrally adjudicated for the absence or presence of SLE.

The sensitivity of the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification was improved over the 1997 version and comparable to the 2012 SLICC classification. The specificity of the 2019 classification was 93% in the validation cohort, which was equal to the 1997 ACR classificationwhen applied to the same cohort, and superior to the 2012 SLICC classification, which, interestingly, exhibited the same specificity as in the initial publication (84%). Overall, the 2019 criteria had a larger combined sensitivity and specificity than the 1997 and the 2012 criteria (1.90 vs 1.76 and 1.80, respectively, in the validation cohort).

Importantly, the 2019 classification declared a history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity as an entry criterion. This excludes a small number of patients with lupus who have never had a positive ANA test from being classified as SLE, which the authors deemed acceptable for the purpose of recruiting for clinical trials.

Derivation and validation of the 2019 EULAR/ACR were extremely well done, and the new classification was implemented immediately by rheumatologists worldwide. But how does the classification perform in daily clinical practice, where recruitment for studies takes place? Here we report the application of the criteria in a cohort of patients with SLE, patients with non-SLE ARD, and patients with hepatic diseases from a large outpatient clinic of a university medical centre in Germany.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: serum autoantibodies in clinical practice [^114eLiwi]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Following this report and the fact that members of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) were made aware of other inaccurate results for ANA testing, the College set up a Task Force to "evaluate the extent of the problem and to recommend solutions". The Task Force reviewed the relevant literature and concluded that solid phase immunoassays may not be appropriate for replacing IIF as a screening test for the detection of ANA. The key recommendations of the Task Force were that, first, IIF ANA test should remain the gold standard for ANA testing and, second, that hospital and commercial laboratories using bead-based multiplex platforms or other solid phase assays for detecting ANA must provide data that their assay has the same or improved sensitivity and specificity as IIF ANA.

More recently Pisetsky, in an Opinion published in Nature Reviews/Rheumatology, wonders whether: "Antinuclear antibody testing is misunderstood or misbegotten?" Misbegotten, as per the Cambridge dictionary, relates to something "badly or stupidly planned or designed". Pisetsky reminds us that the nuclear antigens targeted by ANAs are usually present in the cell nucleus, though some may translocate to the cytoplasm, and that the HEp-2 cell line is used for ANA testing in IIF because this cell line displays a wide variety of antigens. HEp-2 cell testing for ANA is indeed recommended as gold standard by the ACR. Pisetsky, however, notes that "unfortunately, the gold standard does not have the brightness and lustre often ascribed to it" since "IIF can be subject to variability related to the assay kit used, conditions of cell fixation, cellular concentration of antigens and the specificity of the anti-IgG reagents". Other issues raised are the initial dilution of the sample and the need for an expert observer. These limitations of the IIF technique have led to an interest in developing assays that might detect ANA more reliably, provide a higher throughput, in association to a decrease demand for experienced personnel and a higher cost efficiency. Pisetsky's review of the available observer-independent assays, however, did not fare particularly well. ELISAs detect antibody of low avidity, while multiplex assays may provide results that require confirmation by IIF. Moreover, at variance with IIF, antigens bound to the inert support in the solid phase immunochemical tests tend to lose conformational epitopes, arguably the most relevant targets of disease specific, possibly pathogenic, autoantibodies.

### New lupus criteria: a critical view [^1157FtaX]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the validation of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Recent Findings

Positive antinuclear antibodies, which constitute the obligatory entry criterion of the EULAR/ACR criteria, were found in the vast majority of SLE patients worldwide, with 97% (94–100%) of patients antinuclear antibodies positive in studies investigating EULAR/ACR criteria performance. Combined over the publications, EULAR/ACR criteria sensitivity was 92% (range 85–97%). Specificity varied more relevantly, with the publications published after the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria showing 93% (83–98%) specificity. Of particular relevance is the good performance of the EULAR/ACR criteria seen in pediatric SLE as well as in early SLE.

Summary

The new classification criteria have been investigated in an impressive number of cohorts worldwide, adding to the data from the EULAR/ACR criteria project cohort. It is critical to strictly keep to the attribution rule, that items are only counted if there is no more likely alternative explanation than SLE, the domain structure, where only the highest weighted item in a domain counts, and the limitation to highly specific tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA.

### Clinical conditions associated with a high antinuclear antibody titer in individuals without autoimmune disease [^113rfZHg]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are present at high titers in 2% of the general population but their clinical significance in individuals without an autoimmune (AI) disease is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of a high ANA titer in non- AI conditions is associated with disease.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's de-identified electronic medical record system. Individuals without AI disease who had an ANA test were classified into 3 groups: high titer (HT, ANA ≥ 1:640), low titer (LT, ANA ≤ 1:80), and negative ANA (NG). The prevalence of diagnoses recorded within 90 days of the ANA test were compared among groups in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) adjusting for age at ANA testing, sex, median body mass index (BMI), and reported race. A P-value < 5×10⁻⁵ was considered significant.

Results

A total of 28,781 individuals qualified for the study: 3.1% in the HT, 12.3% in the LT, and 84.6% in the NG groups. BMI was similar between groups (P-value = 0.345), but individuals in the HT group were older (P = 3.9×10⁻⁷³). A high ANA titer increased risk of 46 and 67 clinical diagnoses when comparing the HT group with the LT and the NG groups, respectively. The most significant associations in both comparisons included liver disorders/complications and risk factors for liver disease.

Conclusions

A high ANA titer in the absence of an AI disease was associated with increased risk of liver disorders and related risk factors and complications.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^114ZNfsX]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoantibodies

In essence, SLE is a multi-autoantibody and immune complex disease. With more autoantibody tests available over time, immunological abnormalities are seen in essentially all patients with SLE. In parallel, the importance of securing the presence of immunological abnormalities has become obvious, with the phase II belimumab clinical trial showing effects in serologically active patients only. While the latter is not surprising, the SLICC criteria have responded by making at least one immunological criterion an absolute requirement for SLE classification.

A systematic literature search and metaregression within the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria project found that the vast majority of SLE patients [97.8% (95% CI 96.8, 98.5)] have positive ANAs, or have at least been ANA positive historically. In a Delphi exercise, SLE experts all over the world also closely linked ANA and SLE. Given the high sensitivity of the ANA test, combined with its low specificity, and the fact that ANAs are used as a screening parameter in clinical routines, ANAs are now an obligatory entry criterion for the EULAR/ACR 2019 SLE classification criteria. While this precludes (always) ANA-negative SLE patients from classification by the new criteria, this is a very uncommon situation acceptable for classification.

### Antinuclear antibody multiplex utilization across a large federal hospital system: an investigation of ordering practices and rheumatologic outcomes [^1116rSfi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To understand the ordering patterns of antinuclear antibody (ANA) multiplex testing in a single, large US Department of Defense (DoD) tertiary healthcare system.

Methods

Records of patients with an ANA multiplex assay ordered over a 1-year period were evaluated in a large DoD hospital system. Duplicate tests and patients with a previously established autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD) prior to the year of study were excluded. The remaining 2499 patients' charts were reviewed for clinical presentation, ordering specialty, ordering rationale, and whether subsequent rheumatology evaluations resulted in a new ARD diagnosis.

Results

The ANA multiplex assay was ordered most often by primary care and medicine subspecialties for > 100 reasons. In the ANA multiplex assay-negative group, 37/2228 (1.66%) individuals were diagnosed with a new ARD. In the ANA multiplex assay-positive group 37/271 (13.7%) individuals were diagnosed with a new ARD. Sjögren disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease were the most common newly diagnosed ARDs in the ANA multiplex assay-positive group. Rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative spondyloarthritis were the most common new ARD diagnoses in the ANA multiplex assay-negative group. In this study, 97% of the ordered ANA assays did not lead to an ARD diagnosis.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates frequent utilization of the ANA multiplex assay in the evaluation of nonspecific signs and symptoms, with a low rate of ANA-associated ARDs suggesting a need for implementation of strategies to improve understanding of appropriate clinical contexts that warrant ANA testing.

### How should a district general hospital immunology service screen for anti-nuclear antibodies? An' in-the-field'audit [^1165hQWZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing assists in the diagnosis of several immune-mediated disorders. The gold standard method for detection of these antibodies is by indirect immunofluorescence testing on human epidermoid laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells. However, many laboratories test for these antibodies using solid-phase assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which allows for higher throughput testing at reduced cost. In this study, we have audited the performance of a previously established ELISA assay to screen for ANA, making comparison with the gold standard HEp-2 immunofluorescence test. A prospective and unselected sample of 89 consecutive ANA test requests by consultant rheumatologists were evaluated in parallel over a period of 10 months using both tests. ELISA and HEp-2 screening assays yielded 40 (45%) and 72 (81%) positive test results, respectively, demonstrating lack of concordance between test methods. Using standard and clinical samples, it was demonstrated that the ELISA method did not detect several ANA with nucleolar, homogeneous and speckled immunofluorescence patterns. None of these ELISA(NEG) HEp-2(POS) ANA were reactive with a panel of six extractable nuclear antigens or with double-stranded DNA. Nonetheless, 13 of these samples (15%) originated from patients with recognized ANA-associated disease (n = 7) or Raynaud's phenomenon (n = 6). We conclude that ELISA screening may fail to detect clinically relevant ANA that lack defined specificity for antigen.

### Laboratory evaluation in pediatric autoimmune diseases [^1162uSRt]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric autoimmune diseases are chronic lifelong disorders associated with potential disability and increased morbidity and mortality if not properly recognized and treated. On the basis of largely expert opinion in addition to observational studies, children with suspected autoimmune disease should undergo general laboratory and autoantibody screening. (1)(2)(4)(6)(7)(11) There can be many causes of positive antinuclear antibody test results, including, but not limited to, autoimmune disease. On the basis of expert opinion and observational studies, a thorough history and physical examination as well as laboratory evaluation is recommended (often in consultation with a pediatric rheumatologist) to elucidate the cause for a positive test result.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^1132MwPs]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of SLE in early stages is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of presenting symptoms and the poor performance metrics of the screening ANA test. Even the more specific double-stranded DNA autoantibody has relatively low predictive value in early disease. A consequence is delayed referral, with the likelihood that some patients have progression of disease prior to specialist evaluation. Tests that might fill this diagnostic gap are therefore needed. The AVISE Connective Tissue Disease Test that uses a multiplex approach to detect autoantibodies and cell-bound complement products has shown utility in distinguishing SLE from other rheumatological conditions. Whether it might be useful in early disease stages to predict progression is addressed in a recent study by Liang and colleagues, who tested clinic patients who had non-specific findings with the objective of determining whether AVISE could predict onset of SLE. While this test provided more useful prognostic information than other available diagnostics, it had relatively low sensitivity, suggesting that significant numbers of patients with preclinical SLE would be missed by this screening. The need remains for development of diagnostics with robust sensitivity and specificity in early disease that would also deliver prognostic information about risk for SLE. Such tests would have great value as a tool for primary providers to more efficiently triage ANA-positive patients for appropriate specialty evaluation.

### Differences in the clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies according to titers and patterns in children [^113nzsFy]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the differences in the clinical significance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) according to their titers and patterns in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases (AiD) in pediatric patients. Of the 2442 children who had undergone an ANA test, 473 (19.4%) were positive for ANA, of whom 33 (7.0%) were diagnosed with significant AiD. The positive predictive value (PPV) for significant AiD was considerably high on application of an ANA titer of ≥ 1:640, and the PPV of a dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern was significantly lower compared with those of speckled and homogenous patterns. The diagnostic value of ANA positivity for AiD is limited, and the clinical significance of the DFS pattern is relatively lower compared with that of other patterns, such as homogenous and speckled patterns, in children. It is necessary to approach the significance of ANA in children individually depending on titers and patterns.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study population and design

The All of Us Research Program is a cohort study aiming to enroll 1,000,000 participants with genomic data linked with environmental surveys and electronic health records (EHRs). As of the latest data release (version 7), All of Us included 312,925 and 245,388 individuals with genotyping and whole‐genome sequencing data, respectively. For the GWAS analysis, we selected participants who had genotyping data available and a positive ANA test in their EHR by immunofluorescence (IF) as defined by the performing laboratory, or if titer data are available, a titer greater than 1:80 (Supplementary List 1). We excluded individuals who had one positive ANA test but subsequently had a negative test by IF or enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We did not include individuals who only had a positive ANA by ELISA in this study (n = 225). Individuals with any clinical code for autoimmune diseases or prescription for an immunosuppressive medication in their EHR from both the cohorts who were ANA positive and who were ANA negative were also excluded (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary List 2). We then conducted a sensitivity analysis by restricting the sample to individuals with available titer data and ANA titers greater than 1:160, to assess whether higher ANA titers are associated with genetic signals with a GWAS level of significance.

### Don't order antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear… [^113MEpFB]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Testing for antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen should be avoided in the investigation of widespread pain or fatigue alone. Instead, testing should be performed only in patients suspected to have a diagnosis of a connective tissue disease. ANA positivity can be as high as 20% in patients with nonrheumatic conditions and healthy individuals. For this reason, proper pretest probability is important, and false-positive results may lead to further unnecessary testing. Repeat testing is also not recommended unless the clinical picture changes significantly.

### Diagnosing renal involvement in connective tissue disease: interpretation of anti-nuclear autoantibody tests [^112P8k9f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Renal involvement is common in CTDs and causes a range of glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular pathologies. Autoantibody testing can play an important diagnostic role in patients with multisystem symptoms with renal impairment or dipstick abnormalities. However, their effective clinical utility depends on a reasonably high working pre-test probability of disease, as serological tests are not generally well-performing screening tools in wider populations.

Close liaison with the immunology laboratory can be helpful in evaluating patients whose clinical picture and serological test results are discordant. In some cases, testing for extended autoantibody panels is helpful in reaching a firmer diagnosis. In other cases, alternative diagnoses can lead to unexpected serological test results.

We summarize the diagnostic performance of ANA and ENA tests in Table 1.

### Clinical utility of antinuclear antibody tests in children [^112wnHjB]. BMC Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests are frequently used to screen children for chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the diagnostic utility of this test is limited because of the large number of healthy children who have low-titer positive tests. We sought to determine the clinical utility of ANA tests in screening children for rheumatic disease and to determine whether there are specific signs or symptoms that enhance the clinical utility of ANA tests in children.

Methods

We undertook a retrospective analysis of 509 new patient referrals. Charts of patients referred because of results of ANA testing were selected for further analysis. Children with JRA, SLE, and other conditions were compared using demographic data, chief complaints at the time of presentation, and ANA titers.

Results

One hundred ten patients were referred because of an ANA test interpreted as positive. Ten patients were subsequently diagnosed with SLE. In addition, we identified one patient with mixed connective tissue disease, and an additional child with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon. Eighteen children of the children referred for a positive ANA test had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Another 80 children with positive ANA tests were identified, the majority of whom (n = 39, 49%) had musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Neither the presence nor the titer of ANA served to distinguish children with JRA from children with other musculoskeletal conditions. Children with JRA were readily identified on the basis of the history and physical examination. Children with SLE were therefore compared with children with positive ANA tests who did not have JRA, designated the "comparison group". Non-urticarial rash was more common in children with SLE than in children without chronic inflammatory disease (p = 0.007). Children with SLE were also older (mean ± sd = 14.2 ± 2.5 years) than the comparison group (11.0 ± 3.6 years; p = 0.001). ANA titer was also a significant discriminator between children with SLE and children without chronic inflammatory disease. The median ANA titer in children with SLE was 1: 1,080 compared with 1:160 for other children (p < 0.0001). ANA titers of ≥ 1,080 had a positive predictive value for SLE of 1.0 while titers of ≤ 1: 360 had a negative predictive value for lupus of 0.84.

Conclusion

Age and ANA titer assist in discriminating children with SLE from children with other conditions. ANA tests are of no diagnostic utility in either making or excluding the diagnosis of JRA.

### From ANA-screening to antigen-specificity: an EASI-survey on the daily practice in European countries [^113gsqS7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

One of the main goals of the European Autoimmunity Standardisation Initiative (EASI) is the harmonisation of test-algorithms for autoantibodies related to systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD).

Methods

A questionnaire was used to gather information on methodology, interpretation, and the algorithm for detection of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) in relation to their antigen-specificity. The questionnaire was sent to 1200 laboratories in 12 European countries.

Results

The response rate was 47.2%. The results reveal not only apparent differences between countries, but also within countries.

Conclusions

Awareness of these differences may as such already stimulate harmonisation, but the observed differences may also direct recommendations that may further contribute to achieving the EASI goal of harmonisation of autoimmune diagnostics for SARD.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^112SZvRo]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

ANA in healthy populations

A number of studies have looked at the frequency of positive ANA tests in "healthy" individuals. A study by Arroyave et al. in 1988 screened sera from 241 "normal" children, testing for only IgG ANA, using both mouse kidney and human epithelial cells (HEp-2 cells). The study found a maximum positivity rate of only 2.0% at the lowest dilutions. However, data from adult studies have found much higher rates. In an adult study from 15 international laboratories using HEp-2 cells as substrate, ANA positive tests occurred in 31.7% of a putatively normal population at a serum dilution of 1:40. Even at a dilution of 1:320, 3.3% of the sera were positive. Interestingly the ANA frequency did not differ significantly across the age range of 20–60 years. The rate of ANA positivity among blood donors in Holland was also quite high at 12.7%, with titers greater than 1:80 occurring in over 4%. It is not clear why there is such a low frequency of ANA positivity in children, compared to the much higher frequency found in most adult studies (of which only two of many are referenced here). As ANA tests are usually performed on children or adults with musculoskeletal or rheumatologic symptoms or signs, the frequency of ANA among clinic populations is more pertinent to our discussion than the situation in the normal population

The ANA test in health and disease

In diagnosing children with rheumatic disease, there are no markers as of now that identify a risk factor for a disease. Risk factors might allow primary prevention (e.g. screening for high serum cholesterol) or secondary prevention (e.g. detecting an illness before there are signs and symptoms e.g. pap smears for cervical cancer). In rheumatology only tertiary prevention is possible as illness may be detected as early in the disease course as possible in an effort to try and prevent the disease worsening and causing significant complications. Ideally there should be a screening test for children with arthritis or other positive rheumatic physical findings with a high specificity (test normal when someone does not have the disease) and high sensitivity (test abnormal when someone has the illness). A screening test should allow early diagnosis compatible with primary or secondary prevention.

For children with arthritis, only a few diagnostic tests are available (e.g. Lyme titer) and the ANA in particular has very limited usefulness as a diagnostic test. To put it another way, ideally a test should always be positive in those with a disease, and always negative in those without a disease. This situation rarely if ever occurs, but to be useful a test generally needs to have sensitivity and specificity of at least 90%. That is, at least 9 out of 10 individuals with the disease will have a positive test, a "true positive", and 9 out of 10 individuals without the disease will have a negative test. Unfortunately the ANA test, whether performed by IF or by an enzyme linked immunosorbent method (ELISA), fails to demonstrate these test characteristics. The ELISA particularly has its problem with false positives.

Part of the problem is that the test is being used indiscriminately as part of "a rheumatologic work-up" or "rheumatology panel". No test can sensibly be expected to be accurate in the diagnoses of diseases as different as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, MCTD, scleroderma, or the vasculitis diseases. Yet, in practice, this is what often seems to be asked of the ANA test. However, even if the test is used more sensibly to address specific questions such as: "does this child with a rash and fever have lupus?" or "does this child with a swollen knee have juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)?", or "is this child with JIA going to develop uveitis?" we would argue that the ANA test is simply not accurate enough to answer even these questions.

### Antinuclear antibody testing for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113bfRPo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition that may involve multiple organ systems. Although the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in nearly every case of SLE, it is not specific for this disease and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Key features that warrant ANA testing include unexplained multisystem inflammatory disease, symmetric joint pain with inflammatory features, photosensitive rash, and cytopenias. ANA staining patterns and more specific autoantibody testing may be helpful in diagnosis of suspected SLE or ANA-associated disease. For patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue, ANA testing is of limited value.

### Autoantibody diagnostics in clinical practice [^115HxgEU]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Disease associated autoantibodies (AAB) are important biomarkers not only to confirm the diagnosis of the respective systemic autoimmune disease but also to diagnose the disease at very early stages (mono- or oligosymptomatic manifestations) or to diagnose the respective disease without the typical clinical manifestations (atypical forms). A confirmation of the diagnosis in early stages is required, if patients should benefit from early therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, AAB determinations are used for prognostic purposes and for monitoring of disease activity or response to therapy. For the advancement of autoantibody diagnostics in clinical practice the following aspects have to be considered: (i) The search for novel clinically relevant AAB and the identification of autoantigenic targets of AAB broadened the spectrum of autoimmune diagnostics and permit the diagnosis of former idiopathic diseases. (ii) To obtain steady diagnostic variables of clinically relevant AAB, the evaluation studies have to be standardized. (iii) Several special features and novel developments of autoantibody diagnostics make correct interpretation of antibody test results increasingly difficult. (iv) Beside standardization of AAB detection methods and quality management efforts the improvement of autoantibody diagnostics depends on further development of diagnostic algorithms including cost-effective multiparametric analyses.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus classification and diagnosis [^116BFcgW]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were published, they were externally validated by groups worldwide. In particular, the new criteria worked well also in East Asian and pediatric cohorts. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an entry criterion were critically discussed, but the group of ANA-negative patients is small (< 5%) worldwide. Specificity of the criteria is dependent on correct attribution only of those criteria that are not better explained by other causes. Although the classification criteria should not be used for diagnosis, many novel aspects inform diagnostic considerations.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^116X4xDp]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In our lab, no combination of ANA titer, or staining pattern was specific for any particular rheumatic disease. The test combinations with the best positive predictive values for a rheumatic disease were: a) a titer ≥ 1:640 with mitotic positive staining or b) a titer ≥ 1:640 with a homogenous and mitotic staining pattern. These tests had positive predictive values of 77% and 72% respectively. Yet these results were only slightly higher than the positive predictive value of 69% obtained with a titer of ≥ 1:640 alone, ignoring the pattern of staining. Although the addition of patterns somewhat increases the specificity and positive predictive value of the ANA test for a rheumatic disease, it does so at the expense of both the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the test using titers alone.

The pattern of staining also does not appear to be helpful in distinguishing between rheumatic diseases. For example, although high titer homogenous, mitotic positive staining was the most common combination seen in children with SLE, it was actually found in only 27.3% of ANA positive lupus patients. This combination was also found in 12.5% of ANA positive JRA and 5.4% of ANA positive JDM patients. This lack of specificity of the ANA immunofluorescent pattern has been recognized previously, both for adults and children. A study by Parker et al. evaluated the usefulness of combining ANA titer and pattern. Although they felt that knowledge of both titer and pattern was helpful, they did not calculate specific test characteristics, and in fact no combination was restricted to any single rheumatic disease. Our assessment of these data is that the addition of information about patterns of immunofluorescence does not appear to significantly improve the utility of the ANA test.

### Randomised prospective trial to assess the clinical utility of multianalyte assay panel with complement activation products for the diagnosis of SLE [^114TqZZ3]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first prospective multisite randomised study aimed to compare and quantify the clinical utility of different laboratory testing methods in facilitating the diagnosis of SLE. The clinical utility of antibody systems in the assessment of SLE is undisputed. Although these biomarkers are known to lack ideal diagnostic accuracy, rheumatologists have relied on them to facilitate the differential diagnosis of SLE. Therefore, it is recognised that new technologies that improve standard diagnostic laboratory and immunology testing in SLE are needed. However, the improvement in clinical validity and accuracy of novel diagnostic tests (over standard practice) on their own is insufficient to satisfy the scrutiny from stakeholders in the healthcare system, including payors, clinicians and patients. New technologies introduced in clinical laboratory practice must demonstrate their value in the real-life setting. We have previously established that MAP with CB-CAPs has clinical utility in rheumatologist practices, by retrospective chart review, using physician-reported likelihood of SLE for patients evaluated for signs and symptoms of SLE.

In this study, our objective was to establish the clinical utility of the MAP/CB-CAPs in clinical practice in a prospective, scientific study. There were some challenges associated with the design of the study, especially due to the lack of consensus and heterogeneity regarding the SDLT in patients who are being considered for a diagnosis of SLE. Therefore, we purposely made no recommendation as to what tests to order or what laboratory to order them from in the group of patients randomised to the SDLT arm, to better reflect common clinical practice. Clinical utility was defined probabilistically and semiquantitatively using the change in the likelihood of SLE, assessed using five-point Likert scale collected pretesting and post-testing. All patients enrolled in the study were referred with an history of ANA positivity and were considered to have a low to moderate likelihood of SLE as determined by the enrolling rheumatologists and the adjudicators, based on prior history and clinical and demographic features at presentation. Since the criteria for entry were a positive ANA and a low to moderate likelihood of SLE, it is not surprising that most of the patients enrolled in this study were negative for the MAP/CB-CAPs index score in both arms. This is comparable to the target population of patients tested in our clinical laboratory. As expected, the likelihood of SLE decreased in the group of patients randomised to SDLT arm, and these data are consistent with the low prevalence of SLE in the population of ANA-positive patients referred to the rheumatologist for a suspicion of SLE.

### Abnormal antinuclear antibody titers are less common than generally assumed in established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus [^112dPEs7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests in established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (F-ANA) and enzyme-immunoassays detecting antinucleosomal antibodies (ANSA-EIA).

Methods

Sera from 50 patients with SLE and 65 patients with RA were analyzed regarding abnormal concentrations of F-ANA (serum dilution ≥ 1:200 = 95th percentile among 300 healthy blood donors). The sera were also analyzed with 2 commercial ANSA-EIA kits.

Results

An abnormal F-ANA titer occurred in 76% of the SLE sera compared to 23% in RA, and was not related to present use of antirheumatic drugs. At dilution 1:50, 84% of the SLE sera were F-ANA-positive compared to 20% of healthy women. Forty percent and 56%, respectively, of the SLE sera tested positive in the 2 ANSA-EIA kits. By the most sensitive assay, 96% of the ANSA-positive SLE sera produced a homogenous (chromosomal) F-ANA staining pattern compared to 18% of the ANSA-negative SLE sera. Ten of the 15 F-ANA-positive RA sera (63%) generated homogenous F-ANA staining and 13 (20%) tested positive in the most sensitive ANSA-EIA, but with no correlation to the F-ANA staining pattern.

Conclusion

The sensitivity of F-ANA at an abnormal titer was surprisingly low (76%) in established cases of SLE. ANSA occurred in 56% of the SLE sera, but also in a fair number (20%) of RA sera. Practically all ANSA-positive SLE sera were identified by chromosomal F-ANA staining. We conclude that the antigen-specific antinucleosomal EIA does not have high enough diagnostic specificity to justify use of this analysis for routine diagnostic purposes.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^111BdaAR]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

ANA in clinic populations-ANA titers

Chudwin et al. in 1983 evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings in 138 children with a positive ANA test. The authors interpreted the fact that two-thirds of the patients had a specific connective tissue disease as being indicative that the ANA test is useful. Yet the fact that one third did not have a definitive inflammatory disease indicates that the ANA test has a very high false positivity rate.

We evaluated the results of all the ANA tests performed at British Columbia's Children's Hospital over a 5 year span. We found that the ANA test was positive at a titer of 1:20 or greater in 41% of all sera tested, and in 65% of all patients in whom a diagnosis could be obtained from the ordering physician. The frequency was the same for those children with or without a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease. At a screening serum dilution of 1:40 a positive test had a sensitivity of only 63% and a positive predictive value (the frequency that a positive test is indicative of disease) of only 33% for any rheumatic disease.

For SLE, MCTD or overlap syndrome, the ANA had a very high sensitivity of 98%, but a very low positive predictive rate of only 10%. Positive and negative predictive values are affected by the prevalence of the disease being tested. Therefore one might expect somewhat better predictive values from a pediatric rheumatology clinic than from a wide population of ill children. We concluded from this study that although a negative ANA test made the diagnosis of SLE or MCTD extremely unlikely, a positive test at even moderately high titers of 1:160 has little or no diagnostic value.

### Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing… [^117RkWs6]. publications.aap.org (2003). Low credibility.

Testing for the presence of antinuclear antibody should be undertaken in a patient for whom relevant connective tissue or rheumatologic disorders are credible diagnostic considerations. It can serve as a laboratory marker that supports confirmation of a disease already suspected based on the child's history and physical examination or to subcategorize a condition at risk for complications. In the case of the former, further assay for antibody specificity is necessary to determine which nuclear autoantigens are targeted, leading to greater accuracy in determining whether SLE or some other autoimmune disorder is present. Because ANA can be present in children and adolescents who are without disease, the test can be misleading if used for screening in the absence of a consistent clinical picture. An ANA-related phenomenon initially was reported in.

### Using antinuclear antibody testing in pediatric rheumatology [^117Hxb1E]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is frequently used for the identification of patients who are at a high risk of developing autoimmune rheumatological diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the final diagnoses of patients applied to the pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinic with a positive ANA test result. In this study, the medical records of 283 children who had ANA positivity between January 2010 and January 2022 were evaluated retrospectively. All patients were younger than 18 years of age at diagnosis and were followed up in the pediatric rheumatology department for at least 6 months. The majority of the patients were females (69%), and the mean age was 9.9 ± 4.7 years. 94% of the ANA tests were requested in pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinics, and 6% in general pediatrics and other outpatient clinics. Arthritis was the most common reason for ANA testing (41.7%). Of the patients who had ANA positivity, 37% were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 15% with connective tissue diseases, 10% with autoinflammatory disease, and 7% with vasculitides. Positivity at 1/320 and 1/640 titers were more common in the patients diagnosed with autoimmune connective tissue diseases or JIA compared to the patients without these diagnoses (P = 0.009 and P = 0.013, respectively). The ANA test should be judiciously requested by pediatric rheumatologists, especially in suspected cases of autoimmune rheumatic disorders and JIA patients to aid in classification. Indiscriminate use of the ANA test for screening may potentially misguide clinicians.

### The clinical relevance of anti-DFS70 autoantibodies [^117QHf2V]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite all the progress in the establishment of specific autoantibody assays, screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells for quality-oriented laboratory diagnosis of ANA associated rheumatic diseases (AARD) remains indispensable but is not without limitations. Recent data on the relevance of the dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern and anti-DFS70 antibodies disclosed novel possibilities to optimize the serological stepwise diagnostics of AARD. The DFS pattern on HEp-2 cells is well differentiated from the classic "homogeneous" ANA pattern associated with dsDNA antibodies. This is the most frequent pattern in high titer ANA-positive healthy persons. The most characteristic ANA specificity associated with DFS pattern is the anti-DFS70 antibody (synonym LEDGF antibody). The prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in AARD patients is significantly lower compared with the prevalence in ANA-positive healthy persons. There is a negative association between anti-DFS70 antibodies and AARD, especially if no concomitant AARD-specific autoantibodies are found. Isolated anti-DFS70 antibodies are detectable in less than 1% of AARD but are detectable in 2–22% of healthy persons. In the presence of an isolated anti-DFS70 antibody, the posttest probability for AARD is reduced significantly. The significance of anti-DFS70 antibodies as a criterion that helps to exclude AARD is also confirmed by follow-up studies on anti-DFS70 antibodies of positive, healthy individuals, who did not develop any AARD during a 4 year observation period. Consequently, anti-DFS70 antibodies are valuable novel biomarkers for better interpretation of positive ANA in cases of negative AARD-associated autoantibodies and should be integrated in modified test algorithms to avoid unnecessary referrals and examinations of ANA-positive persons.

### Measurement of antinuclear antibodies and their fine specificities: time for a change in strategy? [^112LDGJf]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The current strategy for antinuclear antibody (ANA) analysis involves screening for presence with a subsequent detailed analysis of their specificity. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and financial efficacy of this strategy between different commercial tests in a large cohort of unselected patients.

Methods

In all consecutive 1030 patients associations were defined between results from different ANA test systems and the pre-test probability for connective tissue disease (CTDs). Test systems were used for screening (ANA-IIF vs. CTD screen) and definition of their fine specificity (profile 3 line blot vs. CTD single analytes).

Results

Positive ANA-IIF and/or CTD screen results were found in 304 sera. Further analysis for ANA-specificity by profile 3 line blot and CTD single analytes showed 86 discrepant results of which more than a third are clinically relevant, with the CTD single analyte assay performing better than the line blot in supporting or confirming the presence of a CTD. Autoantigens present in one test but absent in the other were of minor practical use. The ANA screening and identification strategies currently employed are not cost-effective as 83% of tests were performed in order to find specific autoantibodies in patients without the fitting clinical signs or symptoms. This causes many unexpected positive results and subsequent confusion with regard to interpretation.

Conclusions

We advocate that some autoantigens should be excluded from the line blot and CTD assays and propose the use of a cost-effective and selective ANA specificity testing purely based on clinical guidance.

### Utility of repeated antinuclear antibody tests: a retrospective database study [^114VGJwC]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing is frequently used as a diagnostic or screening test in patients with inflammatory or musculoskeletal symptoms. The value of repeat testing is unclear. We sought to evaluate the frequency, utility, and cost of repeat ANA testing. The main objective was to assess the positive predictive value of a repeat ANA test for the diagnosis of rheumatological conditions associated with ANA.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed data from a single, multisite tertiary health network in Australia across a 7-year period. ANA and other autoimmune test results were obtained from the hospital pathology system with a positive ANA titre cutoff set at 1:160. Clinical information was sourced from clinical information systems on any patient who had a change in ANA result from negative to positive on repeat testing. The cost of repeated ANA testing was calculated using the Australian Government Medicare Benefits Schedule.

Findings

From March 19, 2011, to July 23, 2018, a total of 36715 ANA tests were done in 28840 patients at a total cost of US$675029 (2018 equivalent). 14058 (38·3%) of these ANA tests were positive. 7875 (21·4%) of the ordered tests were repeats in 4887 (16·9%) of the patients, among whom 2683 (54·9%) had initially negative tests, and 2204 (45·1%) had initially positive tests. 511 (19·0%) of the 2683 patients with initially negative tests had a positive result on at least one repeat test, with a median time to first positive result of 1·74 years (IQR 0·54–3·60). A change from negative to positive ANA was associated with a new diagnosis in only five (1·1%) of the 451 patients with clinical information available and no previous diagnosis of an ANA-associated rheumatological condition, yielding a positive predictive value of 1·1% (95% CI 0·4–2·7).

Interpretation

Repeat ANA testing after a negative result has low utility and results in high cost.

### Genetic relationships between systemic lupus erythematosus and a positive antinuclear antibody test in the absence of autoimmune disease [^113jt3bc]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ANAs are a diverse group of antibodies that are routinely measured as part of the clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of SLE and several other autoimmune disorders. A positive ANA test at a titre of 1:80 or greater is a requirement to meet the classification criteria for SLE; however, approximately 12%–20% of the general population have a positive ANA in the absence of an autoimmune disorder, and 2% have high titres.

In some autoimmune diseases such as SLE, ANAs play a role in disease pathogenesis through the deposition of immune complexes in tissues, promotion of cytokine production, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and cross-reactivity with different cellular antigens. The role of ANAs occurring in the absence of autoimmune disease is, however, unclear. Some studies have suggested associations with atherosclerosis, cardiovascular events, several types of cancerand all-cause mortality. We previously found that a positive ANA in the absence of autoimmune disease was associated with an increased risk of Raynaud's syndrome and alveolar/perialveolar-related pneumopathies. Moreover, the immunological profile of people with a positive ANA without autoimmune disease is altered and characterised by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, antibody production and upregulation of genes involved in autoimmune diseases.

These observations suggest that people without autoimmune diseases who have a positive ANA test may share some of the immunological dysregulation characteristics of SLE and, thus, may have a similar genetic predisposition. Accordingly, comparing the genetic predisposition with SLE and a positive ANA in the absence of autoimmune disease could provide insights into shared biology. The genetics of SLE are well-characterisedand twin studies have shown that ANA production in SLE has a genetic component; however, the genetic architecture of ANA production is not well-defined and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for positive ANA have not been performed in populations of European ancestry.

We hypothesised that individuals with a positive ANA in the absence of autoimmune disease and SLE would only partially overlap genetic architectures. Thus, defining the architecture of ANA positivity could improve our understanding of the biology of these diagnoses and identify genetic factors that discriminate individuals at risk for SLE from those with a positive ANA. To define the genetic architecture of a positive ANA without an autoimmune disease, we performed a GWAS using the current recommended titre threshold for ANA positivity (≥ 1:80)and compared the SNPs associations with those in patients with SLE to better understand their genetic relationships.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^112GFTfv]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria for the classification of SLE are the most recent and up-to-date effort to provide a clear framework for the identification of patients with SLE that can be included in clinical trials. SLE is a heterogeneous disease, more a chameleon than a wolf, and this makes it particularly challenging to design and carry out trials of novel medications. Lupus trials are notoriously prone to fail to demonstrate benefit. Being able to clearly define the study cohort is one important prerequisite to pave the way to success.

For the purpose of generating homogeneity, the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification includes a history of ANA positivity as an entry criterion. This provided for maximum specificity, which was one goal of the EULAR/ACR working group, at the expense of decreased sensitivity. Importantly, the classification criteria were not designed to make the diagnosis of SLE, which remains a clinical decision. Nonetheless, all of the items in the classification are typical features of SLE, and as a matter of fact, SLE classification criteria have been useful as an adjunctive tool to make the clinical diagnosis ever since the first inception.

### Antinuclear antibodies: marker of diagnosis and evolution in autoimmune diseases [^116oFZtM]. Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are autoantibodies that attack self-proteins within cell nucleus structures; their presence in serum may indicate an autoimmune disease. Also, positive ANA test results have been obtained in chronic infectious diseases, cancers, medication-related adverse events, and even healthy individuals. As a result, a correct interpretation of the presence of ANAs is needed. Identification of ANAs subtypes is an important part of clinical immunology. The presence of ANAs in patient blood specimens is detected using a cell-line substrate from human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2 cells). On this substrate, ANAs will bind specific antigens, which will lead to a suggestive fluorescent emission. The fluorescence patterns visualized under the fluorescence microscope can be correlated with certain subtypes of ANA and certain autoimmune diseases. Depending on the subtype of ANA present in the serum and the targeted antigen, several staining patterns are reported, namely, nuclear patterns, nucleolar patterns, cell cycle patterns, or cytoplasmatic patterns. Identification of a certain pattern can lead to diagnosis of a certain autoimmune disease.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults [^117S9Umx]. Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, BSR 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that ANA are present in ∼95% of patients with SLE. Recognize that the clinical probability of SLE is low if the test is negative. Recognize that a positive ANA test occurs in ∼5% of the adult population, and alone it has poor diagnostic value in the absence of clinical features of autoimmune rheumatic disease.

### ANA as an entry criterion for the classification of SLE [^114XjZ9i]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease with highly variable clinical and immunological manifestations. In the classification of patients with this condition, the presence of an antinuclear antibody (ANA) is an important element, with new criteria from the American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism positioning ANA positivity by an immunofluorescence assay on HEp2-cells (HEp2-IFA) or by an equivalent solid phase assay as the entry criterion. This positioning is based on assumptions about the frequency of ANA positivity in SLE as well as the reliability of the assays. Studies indicate that these assumptions are still a matter of uncertainty since both types of assay show considerable variability and patients with SLE may display negative results in ANA testing. These findings suggest caution in positioning ANA positivity as an entry criterion for classification and point to the value of alternative serological approaches for ANA determinations.

### Choosing wisely in daily practice: an intervention study on antinuclear antibody testing by rheumatologists [^116v7jbh]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of a simple intervention on antinuclear antibody (ANA) test overuse by rheumatologists.

Methods

This was an explorative, pragmatic, before-and-after, controlled implementation study among rheumatologists working at 3 rheumatology departments in secondary and tertiary care centers in The Netherlands. The intervention was given in all study centers separately and combined education with feedback. Six outcome measures describe the intervention effects: the ANA/new patient ratio (APR), difference with the target APR, percentage of positive ANA tests, percentage of repeated ANA testing, percentage of ANA-associated diseases, and APR variation between rheumatologists. Outcomes were compared between the pre- and postintervention period (both 12 months) using (multilevel) logistic regression or F testing. Results are reported together for centers 1 and 2, and separately for center 3, because ANA tests could not be linked to an individual rheumatologist in center 3.

Results

The APR decreased from 0.37 to 0.11 after the intervention in centers 1 and 2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.17–0.22, P < 0.001) and from 0.45 to 0.30 in center 3 (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45–0.62, P < 0.001). The percentage of repeated ANA requests in all centers and the APR variation for centers 1 and 2 decreased significantly. Only in center 3 did the percentage of ANA-associated diseases increase significantly.

Conclusion

A simple intervention resulted in a relevant and significant decrease in the numbers of ANA tests requested by rheumatologists, together with an improvement on 3 other outcome measures.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of rare antinuclear antibody patterns [^115Exf9s]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

While some of the more frequent antinuclear (auto)antibodies (ANA) patterns such as homogenous nuclear staining have been extensively studied, the prevalence and clinical significance of rare antinuclear antibody patterns are not well understood. For the purpose of this review, we defined rare patterns as patterns occurring in less than 1% of patients that test positive on indirect immunofluorescence. The prevalence of different ANA patterns was determined in 68,128 consecutive patients who attended the outpatient clinic or were hospitalized at the University Hospitals Leuven over a 14-year period (1998–2011). To avoid bias, we only included the first sample for each patient and patients who tested positive in the period 1980–1997 were excluded. There were 9268 patients who tested positive for ANA. With the exception of the clinical association of anti-multiple nuclear dots (at higher titers) and anti-nuclear envelope autoantibodies with autoimmune liver disease, there was no good clinical association of rare ANA patterns with the diagnosis of auto-immune disorders. The most important non-autoimmune cause of rare ANA patterns was carcinoma, particularly in patients with rare cell-cycle related ANAs.

### From ANA to ENA: how to proceed? [^116ANVmX]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), as detected by indirect immuno-fluorescence, are hallmarks of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. Identification of the specificity for extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) is warranted because this may further differentiate between the distinct types of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. In recent years several different ENA, as recognized by ANA, have been identified and the knowledge of the molecular structure has been expanded. Together with technical developments this has enabled the introduction of several new anti-ENA antibody detection systems. In this review we will discuss the main logistic aspects of anti-ENA antibody testing that have to be solved in order to come to a consensus in order to deal with new developments in this field. We conclude that: 1. a positive ANA test should, depending on the titre and pattern, be followed by an anti-ENA antibody assay, 2: to fully appreciate the value of the new anti-ENA antibody detection systems a large, multicenter clinical evaluation is required, and 3: proper interpretation of reported test results requires that the clinician is aware of the way anti-ENA antibodies are detected and reported.

Materials and methods

Study population

We used BioVU, the VUMC DNA biobank linked to a de-identified electronic health record (EHR) system, and the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network consortium.

BioVU cohort: in BioVU, we selected individuals with genome-wide genotype data available on the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA EX) platform that had an ANA test done as part of their clinical care. We excluded individuals: (a) with at least one diagnostic code for SLE or common autoimmune diseases known to be associated with a positive (online supplemental table S1), (b) without an ANA titre reported or had a titre of 1:40, (c) who were also included in the eMERGE cohort and/or (d) from other ancestries except European descent. We defined four mutually exclusive groups (figure 1): (a) ANA positive (ANA+) cases included individuals without an autoimmune disease with an ANA titre of 1:80 or higher. For individuals with more than one ANA test recorded in their EHR, the highest ANA titre was selected to determine eligibility; (b) ANA negative (ANA−) controls included individuals without an autoimmune disease who had only negative ANA results in the EHR; (c) patients with SLE included those diagnosed with SLE by a rheumatologist, nephrologist or dermatologist and (d) general controls included genotyped individuals who did not have a diagnosis of autoimmune disease and were not included in any of the previous groups. To define SLE cases, extensive manual chart review of the EHRs of individuals with at least one diagnostic code for SLE was performed by two physicians (VK and JG) and one rheumatologist (CMS) to ascertain the diagnosis of SLE.

### Next-generation autoantibody testing by combination of screening and confirmation-the cytoBead® technology [^111Vucw8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Occurrence of autoantibodies (autoAbs) is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, and the analysis thereof is an essential part in the diagnosis of organ-specific autoimmune and systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD), especially connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Due to the appearance of autoAb profiles in SARD patients and the complexity of the corresponding serological diagnosis, different diagnostic strategies have been suggested for appropriate autoAb testing. Thus, evolving assay techniques and the continuous discovery of novel autoantigens have greatly influenced the development of these strategies. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) analysis by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on tissue and later cellular substrates was one of the first tests introduced into clinical routine and is still an indispensable tool for CTD serology. Thus, screening for ANA by IIF is recommended to be followed by confirmatory testing of positive findings employing different assay techniques. Given the continuous growth in the demand for autoAb testing, IIF has been challenged as the standard method for ANA and other autoAb analyses due to lacking automation, standardization, modern data management, and human bias in IIF pattern interpretation. To address these limitations of autoAb testing, the CytoBead® technique has been introduced recently which enables automated interpretation of cell-based IIF and quantitative autoAb multiplexing by addressable microbead immunoassays in one reaction environment. Thus, autoAb screening and confirmatory testing can be combined for the first time. The present review discusses the history of autoAb assay techniques in this context and gives an overview and outlook of the recent progress in emerging technologies.

Connective Tissue Disease-Specific Autoantibodies

The loss of immune tolerance characteristic for connective tissue diseases (CTDs) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), poly/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) brings about the generation of various nonorgan-specific autoantibodies (autoAbs). Although the triggering factors for the occurrence of autoAbs and their role in the pathogenesis of CTD are still not entirely understood, autoAbs are widely used as diagnostic markers in clinical routine nowadays. The L.E. cell phenomenon described by Hargraves in the late 1940 in patients suffering from SLE proved to be a result of autoAb binding to nuclear material of polymorphs and marked the beginning of a rapidly evolving autoAb era in clinical diagnostics. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was the first assay technique employed to reveal autoAbs in patients with CTD. The groundbreaking works of Holborow and Friou et al. led to the discovery of so-called antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) as marker autoAbs of CTD like SLE. In the following years, clinicians made tremendous efforts to understand the clinical significance of autoAbs and their potential use for the serological diagnosis of CTD and beyond. This process was greatly driven by novel emerging assay techniques used for autoAb testing and their respective assay performance characteristics (Fig. 1; Table 1). The ensuing discourse has led to the definition of various diagnostic strategies for the serological diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and continues to date. Of note, ANA detected by IIF was included into the diagnostic criteria of SLE and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) later. In this context, the discovery of autoAbs to extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) apart from autoAbs to dsDNA or histones in the search for disease-specific autoAbs provides an intriguing example for the change in the understanding of the clinical meaning of autoAbs as diagnostic markers. Thus, the seminal paper of E.M. Tan and H.G. Kunkel on the identification of Sm as an autoantigenic target of SLE and the use of double radial immunodiffusion (DRID; Ouchterlony technique) for its detection ushered in a new era in autoAb diagnostics and its clinical application. Although ANA turned out to be a sensitive marker for SARD as a whole disease group, its specificity for distinct SARD entities was not satisfactory despite being defined as a diagnostic marker for SLE. Thus, the clinical need for more specific "ANA" was met by the pioneering work of H.G. Kunkel, E.M. Tan, and others discovering more and more novel autoAbs to ENA with clinical significance. However, not all ENAs identified as targets for CTD-specific autoAbs could be isolated by the saline extraction technique reported previously and should not be termed ENA. Furthermore, apart from autoAbs recognizing nuclear autoantigens, anticytoplasmic autoAbs (ACyA) have been introduced into the autoAb panel for SARD serology. Thus, the anti-SjS antigen A (SS-A) autoAbs also termed Ro have been shown to interact with its respective target in the cytoplasm. As a fact, the progress in proteomics enabled the identification of cytoplasmic autoantigenic targets interacting with for instance myositis-specific autoAbs like anti-histidyl tRNAse autoAbs (Jo-1) or SLE specific autoAb against ribosomal proteins. Obviously, this created confusion among clinical and laboratory experts and called for clarification. In terms of ANA testing, the introduction of human epidermoid laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2) cells as improved autoantigenic substrate in IIF has encouraged the reporting of CTD-specific cytoplasmic patterns over the years. This contradiction in terminology was addressed by a recent consensus recommending the use of anticellular antibodies instead of ANA. Notwithstanding, the use of ANA and ENA is well established particularly among clinicians and it remains to be seen how this issue will be solved adequately in the years to come. In summary, autoAb testing is an integral part in the serological diagnosis of CTD and may also assist in the prognosis, subclassification, as well as monitoring of disease activity.

### The predictive value of antinuclear antibodies in patients with suspected connective tissue disease for the development of connective tissue diseases [^114U2XtB]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Early confirmation of the diagnosis of connective tissue diseases (CTD) is important, as prolonged disease activity can result in irreversible organ damage. Although antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) have been shown to precede the diagnosis of SLE, this has not been investigated in large cohorts for other CTDs. In this study, we investigated whether the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies in undiagnosed patients suspected of having CTDs is predictive of development of a future CTD.

Methods

We screened the Electronic Health Records of a cohort of 1030 patients, who were tested for ANAs and their specificity in 2013/2014, to evaluate whether new CTD diagnoses had been recorded by a clinician between the original blood draw date and 2020. We compared the prevalence of ANAs in patients who developed a new CTD diagnosis during follow-up with patients with similar symptoms at baseline who did not receive a subsequent CTD diagnosis and with patients with an established CTD at baseline.

Results

Sixteen out of 1030 patients had developed a new CTD in the studied time period. The mean time period between baseline blood draw and subsequent CTD diagnosis of these patients was approximately 2.3 years. Eleven out of 16 (69%) newly diagnosed patients had positive ANA screening tests, compared to 54% of patients with a CTD diagnosis at baseline (p = ns) and 30% of symptomatic undiagnosed patients (p < 0.001). This resulted in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98% for the development of a new CTD in undiagnosed symptomatic patients. For specific ANAs associated with the suspected CTD, the PPV was 12%, with a NPV of 98%.

Conclusions

Progression to a CTD diagnosis is rare in undiagnosed patients. Undiagnosed patients with symptoms associated with a CTD who progress to a CTD more often have ANAs than patients with similar symptoms who do not progress to a CTD. ANA testing can be used to more stringently select patients who should remain in follow-up.

### Incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus: what remains after application of American College of Rheumatology and systemic lupus international collaborating clinics criteria? [^111zBp8Y]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by formation of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and is known to have a wide range of clinical features 1. The judgment of experienced physicians is generally accepted as the gold standard for the diagnosis of SLE; however, especially for research aims, accurate disease classification is important to create comparable, consistent study groups. For that purpose, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE were proposed 2, 3. A patient is classified as having SLE when 4 of 11 cumulative clinical and immunologic ACR criteria are met (Table 1) (3). In order to increase sensitivity, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) more recently composed new criteria that were validated in 2012 4 (Table 1). The most important differences between the ACR 1997 criteria and the SLICC 2012 criteria include the merging of criteria for subacute or acute cutaneous lupus and photosensitivity and addition of alternative forms of chronic cutaneous lupus; the addition of nonscarring alopecia as a clinical criterion; the redefinition of arthritis; the redefinition of the hematologic criteria; the separation and extension of immunologic criteria; the allowance of biopsy‐confirmed lupus nephritis in the presence of ANAs or anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) to be sufficient for classification of SLE; and the requirement of at least 1 immunologic and 1 clinical criterion for SLE classification. Currently, new classification criteria for SLE are under review by a ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) collaboration 5.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^116WjkLc]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and other novel antigen testing?

Studies (see Table 1) estimate the sensitivity of ANA as 58–85% and specificity as 50–97%. ANA is commonly used as a screening antibody but because of its frequency and low specificity, should not be measured in the absence of clinical indicators.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in SD and various CTDs

Studies (see Table 2) estimate the sensitivity of ENA as 89–92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) in SD

None of the 'novel' autoantibodies out-perform anti-Ro antibody and are not recommended outside a research setting.

Recommendation

Do not measure ANA in the absence of clinical indicators of SD or other CTD (1, C) SOA 94.6%.

Use ANA as a screening antibody where there is a clinical suspicion of CTD (1, C) SOA 93.9%.

Measure ENA even if the ANA is negative if there is a high index of suspicion of SD (1, C) SOA 96.7%.

2a. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland (SG) ultrasound scanning (USS)?

Multiple studies have confirmed the utility of SG USS in the diagnosis of SD in both adults and children, although it may not differentiate between SS and sarcoid or other connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and does not form part of the classification criteria.

Recommendation

USS of the salivary glands can provide useful additional information to support either the presence of or lack of evidence for SD (1, A) SOA 95.2%.

USS does not currently replace either antibody testing or histological analysis in adult SD classification criteria (1, A) SOA 96.4%.

2b. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of other imaging modalities?

Reviews of imaging modalities in SD have concluded that further studies are needed to establish the role of PET, CT and MRI. None of the imaging modalities are included in the most recent classification criteria.

### Diagnosing renal involvement in connective tissue disease: interpretation of anti-nuclear autoantibody tests [^116u5SK3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

How are ANA and ENA assays performed?

ANAs are directed towards components of the cell nucleus. They are detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) cell line. HEp-2 cells, with large nuclei containing many autoantigens, are well suited for the detection of autoantibodies. Patient serum is incubated with the cells before a fluorescent antibody to human immunoglobulin is added. Samples are tested first at a screening dilution (e.g. 1:80) and, if positive, are sequentially diluted until fewer than half the cells are positively stained. This dilution is reported to reflect the strength of ANA binding present in the serum.

Weakly positive ANA titres are common and are often not clinically significant. In addition to the titre, most laboratories report the staining pattern of the antibody, for example, homogeneous, speckled, centromere or nucleolar. This reflects different nuclear proteins to which the antibody has bound (Table 1).

Table 1
Prevalence and associations of antinuclear autoantibodies in CTDs

Specific nuclear antigens are associated with different CTDs. Such antigens were historically removed from the nucleus using salt extraction, giving the name ENAs, but are now commonly measured using a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. These include Sjögren's syndrome–related antigen A (SSA; also known as Ro), Sjögren's syndrome–related antigen B (SSB; also known as La), Smith (Sm), topoisomerase 1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase III, Jo-1 and U1 ribonucleic protein (U1RNP). The antigen panel used for an ENA screen varies between laboratories. For specific clinical questions or in the case of diagnostic uncertainty, it can be helpful to discuss extended screening with a local immunologist.

### Recommendations for the use of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in the diagnosis and follow-up of systemic lupus erythematosus – A proposal from an expert panel [^112Vfhrv]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies are listed as one of the classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are relatively effective indicators for monitoring disease activity and treatment response. Therefore, clinicians rely on them to diagnose and adjust medication and treatment strategies for SLE patients. However, the use of anti-dsDNA antibodies is not free from controversy. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that anti-dsDNA antibodies are found in several disorders, besides SLE. In addition to this, anti-dsDNA antibodies are a heterogeneous group of antibodies, and their determination still lacks proper standardization. Moreover, anti-dsDNA testing specificity and diagnostic performance change depending on the population under study. These and other issues result in inconsistency and encumber the clinical use of anti-dsDNA antibodies. A panel of medical laboratory and clinical experts on SLE discussed such issues based on their clinical experience in a first meeting, establishing a series of recommendations. The proceedings of this first meeting, plus an exhaustive review of the literature, were used to compose a paper draft. The panel subsequently discussed and refined this draft in a second meeting, the result of which is this paper. This document is relevant to clinical laboratories as it guides to improving diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. Simultaneously, it will help laboratories compile more informative reports, not limited to a mere number. It is also relevant to clinical doctors who wish to better understand laboratory methods so that they can do a more efficient, better-aimed laboratory test ordering.

### Different indirect immunofluorescence ANA substrate performance in a diagnostic setting of patients with SLE and related disorders: retrospective review and analysis [^11693bVX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The methodology of ANA tests has changed, yet the ANA indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) test remains one of the most important assays to facilitate the diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs). The indications for ANA testing have expanded from SLE to include other ARDs, such as scleroderma, interstitial lung disease, autoimmune liver disease and inflammatory myopathies. Laboratories attempted originally to use a range of different tissues as sources of intracellular nuclei to improve the indirect IFA, including human gastric parietal cells, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, adrenal gland, colon mucosa, mouse and rat kidney, human fetal fibroblasts, rat liver, KB cellsand mouse liver (ML).

To standardise the substrate for ANA IFA testing, most, if not all, labs had switched by the early 2000s to a cell line, human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2), to create a uniform source of cell nuclei for the ANA test. Furthermore, the cells and nuclei were much larger in HEp-2 and hence were easier to read for nuclear patterns compared with ML and other differentiated tissues. However, to our knowledge, evidence to assert that HEp-2 is superior to other substrates, including ML for ANA evaluation, had been limited to small cohort studies. Even with the development of solid-phase assays, HEp-2 is still regarded by most as the gold standard ANA test.

Due to this uncertainty, between 2003 and 2008, the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Clinical Immunology Laboratory had a transition period during which both HEp-2 and ML ANA tests were performed on the same sera for all ANA tests ordered clinically. Herein we present a historical review of substrates for ANA testing using a large local dataset to compare ANA IFA on HEp-2 and ML substrates on patients with various ARDs. We also determined whether a combination of the two techniques improves ANA sensitivity for the detection of various ARDs. Combinations of ANA assay platforms have been proposed as a solution to the use of a single method for ANA detection (HEp-2 IFA or an equivalent solid-phase assay) in the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for SLE, where the ANA is the entry criterion. This has generated great interest and controversy on the role of ANA testing in SLE classification, highlighting the need for more clarity.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^114vZsmB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Development of rheumatic diseases in ANA positive individuals

It could be argued that the finding of a positive ANA test indicates that the child has an occult disease that will become manifest later. Is there any evidence to support or refute this?

There is some evidence that ANA may sometimes precede the development of SLE by several years. Using Finland's Social Security Institution's population registry, Aho et al. were able to trace 16 serum samples from apparently healthy subjects who later developed SLE or MCTD. Ten of the 16 (62.5%) samples were positive for ANA. Eight of the 11 (72.7%) were positive when the interval from sampling to onset of first symptoms was ≤ 2 years and 2 of 5 cases (40%) were positive when the interval was > 3 years. Based on an incidence rate of lupus of 5/100,000/year, the authors calculated that lupus would develop in less than one percent of the ANA positive individuals. Cabral et al. followed the course of 24 children who were considered clinically not to have an inflammatory disease despite being ANA positive and found that no patient developed an overt inflammatory disease during a follow-up period of 61 months (range 13 to 138 months).

Some studies have evaluated the outcome in patients with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a musculoskeletal pain condition not thought to be an autoimmune disease. Interestingly, some fibromyalgia patients are also ANA positive, but there has been no evidence that the occurrence of a positive ANA influences patient outcome. Al-Allaf et al. found the ANA positivity rate (titers not given, a positive result was simply defined as "plus") in their adult patients with fibromyalgia was 8.8%. This rate was almost identical to the 8.9% ANA positivity rate in their control patients with osteoarthritis. The 12 individuals who had fibromyalgia and were ANA positive were matched for age and sex with 12 ANA negative patients. Over a 2–4 year follow-up period one patient in the ANA positive group fulfilled criteria for SLE, and one in the ANA negative group fulfilled criteria for Sjögren's syndrome. The authors concluded that the ANA test (at least in low titer) was not a good predictor of future connective tissue disease.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^112HJL82]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

For diagnosis, it is important to stress that the sensitivity of ANA of 96–99% means that truly and persistently ANA-negative SLE is possible, although uncommon. Moreover, there are disquieting data that ANA sensitivity may be seriously deficient on some HEp-2 or HEp-2000 cell substrates, even when a highly experienced laboratory performed the IIF assay as the gold standard. The same may be even more troublesome for other test systems, and it is important to know the true performance characteristics of the ANA test in local use. With an appropriately sensitive ANA test, however, an uncommon disease will be quite unlikely with the ANA screening test being negative.

Positive ANAs in SLE are mostly caused by antibodies to chromatin components, i.e. dsDNA and histone proteins that together form nucleosomes, and by RNA binding proteins, which are usually also found in the cytoplasm. Of the antibodies against RNA binding proteins, those against the Smith (Sm) antigen are specific for SLE, while isolated anti-U1RNP antibodies are the hallmark antibody of MCTD and anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are even more common in SS and may occur in SSc. Accordingly, anti-Sm antibodies are included in the 1982 and 1997 ACR classification criteria, the 2012 SLICC criteria and now the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria, where they have a weight of 6, more than half of the necessary 10 points needed for the classification cut-off.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^1164ge1K]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by Friou in 1957, ordering an ANA appears to have become a reflexive response to the question "could this patient have a rheumatic disease?" What is the evidence that ordering such tests is of any value, and what should be done with a positive test?

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^112GgiJ8]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Current evidence from preliminary study results indicates that there is good correlation between manual and automated interpretation of ANA IIF assays, at least in the ability to discriminate between positive and negative results and in recognizing the main IIF patterns. Such systems will therefore speed up routine performance of these tests and help to harmonize interpretation of the results across laboratories. However, there is a need to have their clinical diagnostic power validated by clinical studies, in addition to the analytical studies that have already been published. In addition, these new systems could be further improved if they were better able to recognize mixed fluorescent or less common fluorescent patterns.

### Italian multicentre study for application of a diagnostic algorithm in autoantibody testing for autoimmune rheumatic disease: conclusive results [^112totKi]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

The presence of specific auto-antibodies in serum (i.e., antinuclear antibodies or ANA, anti-extractable nuclear antigens or anti-ENA, and anti-double stranded DNA or anti-dsDNA) is one of the major criteria in the diagnostics of Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease. As such, the request for these tests has grown exponentially in laboratory practice. The aim of this study is to describe the implementation of a joint laboratory-clinics guideline for reducing clinically inappropriate requests for autoantibody testing in a broad geographic area (Parma, Modena, Piacenza, Reggio-Emilia) for the diagnosis of Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease.

Methods

This study, supported by a Regional grant for innovative research projects started in January 2008, is an observational research aimed at comparing the number of ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA testing as well as the percentage of positive test results before and after implementation of the diagnostic algorithm in hospitalized patients. A multidisciplinary team consisting of clinical immunologist and laboratory scientists was established, with the aim of collecting and analysing diagnostic criteria, clinical needs, laboratory report formats, analytical procedures, as well as the number of tests performed. The laboratory results and the clinical protocol were both validated by data emerging from the clinical follow-up studies.

Results

A joint guideline for auto-antibody testing, placing ANA test at the first level, has been developed and implemented since January 2009. The results for the period January-June 2009 (12,738 tests) were compared with those of the same period in 2008 (13,067 tests). A significant reduction in the number of anti-dsDNA (-26%) and anti-ENA (-15%) was observed. The percentage of second-level tests positivity after implementation of the diagnostic protocol had also consistently increased for both ENA (13% vs 17%) and dsDNA (9% vs 11%).

Discussion

The development and implementation of algorithms for the diagnostics of Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease in hospitalized patients was associated with a reduction in the number of second-level tests, but also with an increased diagnostic specificity. This outcome attests that close collaboration and audit between clinicians, laboratory specialists and healthcare services is effective to develop efficient diagnostic algorithms for both hospitalized patients and outpatients.

Analytic techniques for autoantibody testing — method variation and evolving platforms are noted: There is considerable interlaboratory variation in methods; earlier techniques have evolved to ELISA, Western blotting, and immunoblot assays; ELISA antinuclear antibody screening assays may lack sensitivity for certain collagen vascular diseases and therefore require confirmatory indirect immunofluorescence tests; diagnostic accuracy will be based on likelihood ratios; multiplexed proteomic platforms are in development for SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, but optimal conditions for autoantigen arrays have not been established and will require thorough validation.

Sensitivity of commonly used laboratory tests for diagnosing chronic arthritis in children #

# – Summary of data from McGhee et al, ref.

Although the prevalence rate of RF-positive JRA/JIA is higher in certain populations (e.g. American Indians), the diagnostic utility of this test is likely to be limited even in high-prevalence populations, owing to the fact that: [1] the prevalence of a positive test in healthy children from the same populations is unknown; and [2] the exuberant nature of the pathologic process in RF-positive children allows the diagnosis to be made on the basis of the history and physical alone, as demonstrated by both the McGhee and Eichenfield groups. Indeed, Eichenfield and colleagues concluded that, "Testing for rheumatoid factor is a poor screening procedure for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in the general situations in which it is more likely to be requested". Given that McGhee and colleagues have corroborated the findings from the 1986 study, it seems just as reasonable to state categorically that there is never a reason to request a rheumatoid factor assay as a diagnostic test on a child. Pediatric rheumatologists will, however, continue to use rheumatoid factor testing as a prognostic biomarker until better indicators of prognosis emerge.

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) assays have the opposite shortcoming of RF assays: they are commonly positive in healthy children) and the presence of ANA seems to carry no increase in risk for eventually developing rheumatic disease. Furthermore, McGhee and colleagues demonstrated that the titers of ANA seen in children with diverse rheumatic diseases such as JRA/JIA, ankylosing spondylitis, and dermatomyositis, so completely overlap those of healthy children as to make a positive test useless in distinguishing a healthy child from one with any of these diseases. Indeed, ANA tests showed diagnostic utility only in identifying children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where titers of ≥ 1:1,080 were common. However, even in children with SLE, there remained considerable overlap in their ANA titers (1:360–1:640) with those of otherwise healthy children.

Requirement of consensus definition for iSLE

Currently, researchers use various definitions for iSLE, which hinders comparability between different studies. Ideally, a classification system would include patients who are at the highest risk of developing SLE or serious organ damage and exclude those who have prolonged mild symptoms or develop other autoimmune diseases. Prospective documentation of a consistent group of patients with iSLE is required in order to better define the high‐risk group and to determine predictive biomarkers. We therefore ask for the development of a consensus on the definition of iSLE in order to, ideally, combine forces and start prospective documentation of patients with iSLE.

Definition of iSLE involves a very heterogeneous group of patients and should include patients at the highest risk of developing SLE. Mucocutaneous symptoms, serositis, renal symptoms, anticardiolipin antibodies, low complement, and anti‐dsDNA are all associated with progression to SLE. Table 3 shows our proposed definition of iSLE, which aims at including patients with a high risk of developing SLE or serious organ involvement. ANA positivity at a titer ≥ 1:80 should be present in order to be classified as iSLE, as this is a key feature of SLE. A recent systematic review and metaregression 22 on the diagnostic value of ANAs reported 97.8% sensitivity and 74.7% specificity for ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80. Also, in an observational study 23 on 616 patients who were referred due to possible SLE, 99.5% of patients with early SLE were ANA positive. The ACR/EULAR international collaboration on development of new classification criteria for SLE has also reached consensus on using positive ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80 as entry criterion 5.

### Automated tests of ANA immunofluorescence as throughput autoantibody detection technology: strengths and limitations [^117N9rDV]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) assay is a screening test used for almost all autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and in a number of these cases, it is a diagnostic/classification parameter. In addition, ANA is also a useful test for additional autoimmune disorders. The indirect immunofluorescence technique on monolayers of cultured epithelial cells is the current recommended method because it has higher sensitivity than solid phase assays. However, the technique is time-consuming and requires skilled operators. Automated ANA reading systems have recently been developed, which offer the advantage of faster and much easier performance as well as better harmonization in the interpretation of the results. Preliminary validation studies of these systems have given promising results in terms of analytical specificity and reproducibility. However, these techniques require further validation in clinical studies and need improvement in their recognition of mixed or less common staining patterns.

### Commentary-ordering lab tests for suspected rheumatic disease [^116Hadzm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

One of the least-appreciated advances in pediatric rheumatology over the past 25 years has been the delineation of the many ways in which children with rheumatic disease differ from adults with the same illnesses. Furthermore, we are now learning that paradigms that are useful in evaluating adults with musculoskeletal complaints have limited utility in children. Nowhere is that more true than in the use of commonly used laboratory tests, particularly antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) assays. This short review will provide the practitioner with the evidence base that supports a more limited use of ANA and RF testing in children.

### Choosing wisely: review and commentary on anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing [^115mokPy]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Choosing Wisely®: Next Steps in Improving Healthcare Value is an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation. The driving forces for the Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign include rising and unstainable health care expenditures and evidence that there is lack of fiscal stewardship of health care resources. The American College of Rheumatology and the Canadian Rheumatology Association published their top five Choosing Wisely recommendations, the first of which pertained to antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and ANA subserology testing. Concerns about the wasteful use of these tests prompted an analysis of the expenditures attributable to ANA testing as a proportion of total health care expenditures and based on a financial model was in the range of 0.00125%. It is suggested that if the sole use of ANA testing is to add evidence to support a diagnosis when the pre-test probability is high, then the ANA test has limited clinical value. Accordingly, the goal of ANA testing needs to be reconsidered and expanded beyond an approach to simply confirming a diagnosis with 'intention to treat' to a goal of case finding of 'pre- or early disease' with an 'intent to prevent' disease. This an area where more significant inroads can be made in preventing end organ disease and thereby reducing health care expenditures HCE. One CW recommendation that bears emphasizing is that, with a few possible exceptions, repeat ANA or ANA subserology testing has little clinical value in monitoring disease activity or predicting a flare.

### Frequency and clinical utility of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigen in the setting of a negative antinuclear antibody test [^112PGT1D]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Simultaneous antibody testing during screening for autoimmune conditions is discouraged. The incidence of positive extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) in the setting of a negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) has been reported as low. Our objective was to characterize the frequency of diagnosis of new ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD) in the setting of a negative ANA with a positive ENA.

Methods

This was a 7-year retrospective study from a multicenter tertiary health network in Australia. Clinical information was sought on patients over 18years old who had a negative ANA but positive ENA test result. Results were extracted from hospital computer systems.

Results

From March 19, 2011, to July 23, 2018, ENA testing was ordered simultaneously with an ANA test on 4,248 occasions in 3,484 patients. ANA was positive in 2,520 patients (59.3%) and ENA was positive in 1,980 patients (46.6%). Among positive ANA patients, ENA was positive in 1,563 patients (62.0%). Among 1,728 negative ANA tests, ENA was positive in 417 (24.1%) (P < 0.001). A total of 328 patients with discordant ANA/ENA results had data available for further analysis, of whom 279 had no pre-established rheumatologic condition. A new AARD was diagnosed in 17 of 279 patients, yielding a positive predictive value of 6.09% (95% confidence interval 3.59–9.58).

Conclusion

Despite the higher-than-expected incidence of positive ENA in the setting of a negative ANA, the yield of newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases was low. Our findings support the stepwise addition of ENA requests when an ANA test result is positive and clinical suspicion of an AARD is high.

### Diagnosing renal involvement in connective tissue disease: interpretation of anti-nuclear autoantibody tests [^112i83Cy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are characterized by immune system dysregulation, circulating autoantibodies and multisystem disease. Diagnosis is made using both clinical and serological features. Renal involvement — manifesting as renal failure or urine dipstick abnormalities — may be the presenting feature of CTD. Renal and general physicians need to have a good understanding of how serological testing can help in the diagnosis of CTD.

Here we consider how anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) testing can aid the diagnosis of CTD in patients with renal disease. We review how these assays are performed and the principles of serological testing. We summarize the clinical features, renal pathology and diagnostic performance of ANA and ENA testing in a range of CTDs. (We do not discuss lupus nephritis, which is comprehensively covered elsewhere in the literature.)

### Uncommon types of autoantibodies-detection and clinical associations [^11138uKU]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunofluorescence is a basic method for detection of autoantibodies in serum. It is used as screening for people with symptoms suggesting autoimmune process and disease. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) assay detecting antibodies against nuclear proteins used commonly for diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease, although antibodies against cytoplasmic components and mitotic structures are usable in clinic. The majority of ANA nuclear patterns have been comprehensively studied with increasing data. However, the cytoplasmic and mitotic patterns are underestimated and still require further assessment. In this review the clinical associations and significance of uncommon types of autoantibodies are presented and discussed.

### Interpretative comments on autoantibody tests [^112CvyNv]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Immunology laboratories perform diagnostic tests to identify the autoantibody markers needed to classify disorders which are complex, often rare, and hard to define. The recent introduction of new markers and the use of increasingly complicated assay procedures can cause difficulty in interpreting test results. Moreover, during the performance of some tests, some autoantibodies which were not requested, and consequently not expected, may be identified by chance. It is advisable for these positive results to be reported only when they have a high predictive value and suggest the possible presence of an autoimmune disease. An interpretative comment on autoantibody test results is crucial in a number of cases: when autoantibodies with a significant clinical correlation (high specificity) are found; when two or more methods are used to determine the same autoantibody and the results disagree; when unexpected autoantibody positivity is found and in case of results generated by further diagnostic tests conducted by the laboratory on its own initiative. The interpretative comment should be based on the patient's personal characteristics (sex, age) and the other laboratory parameters available; it should specify the diagnostic accuracy of the assay methods used, the clinical and diagnostic correlations of the antibodies which tested positive, and any further tests needed to complete the diagnostic process.

### Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^116UdRoD]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem inflammatory disease that is often difficult to diagnose. Before the diagnosis can be established, four of 11 clinical and laboratory criteria must be met. Antinuclear antibody titer is the primary laboratory test used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Because of the low prevalence of the disease in primary care populations, the antinuclear antibody titer has a low predictive value in patients without typical clinical symptoms. Therefore, as specified by the American College of Rheumatology, this titer should be obtained only in patients with unexplained involvement of two or more organ systems. Patients with an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 and characteristic multiorgan system involvement can be diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus without additional testing; however, patients with an antibody titer of 1:40 who fail to meet full clinical criteria should undergo additional testing, including tests for antibody to double-stranded DNA antigen and antibody to Sm nuclear antigen. While an antinuclear antibody titer of less than 1:40 usually rules out systemic lupus erythematosus, patients with persistent, characteristic multisystem involvement may be evaluated for possible antinuclear antibody-negative disease.

### Antinuclear antibody testing-misunderstood or misbegotten? [^115Mm26w]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are a diverse group of autoantibodies that recognize nuclear macromolecules and their complexes. ANAs represent key biomarkers in the evaluation of rheumatic diseases, most prominently systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ANA testing is commonly performed in the clinical setting. In addition, ANA testing is now used to assess eligibility for participation in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents for SLE. ANAs can be assayed by various techniques, with the fluorescent ANA assay often viewed as the gold standard. Whereas a positive ANA test represents a classification criterion for SLE, up to 20–30% of the healthy population, depending on the assay used, is positive for an ANA, complicating the use of this test for diagnosis or the detection of preclinical autoimmunity. Furthermore, ANAs might be expressed in SLE less commonly than often thought. This Perspectives article discusses important questions about the use of ANA testing in both the clinical and research settings.

### New insights into the role of antinuclear antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112DeUmt]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) that form immune complexes that mediate pathogenesis by tissue deposition or cytokine induction. Some ANAs bind DNA or associated nucleosome proteins, whereas other ANAs bind protein components of complexes of RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Levels of anti-DNA antibodies can fluctuate widely, unlike those of anti-RBP antibodies, which tend to be stable. Because anti-DNA antibody levels can reflect disease activity, repeat testing is common; by contrast, a single anti-RBP antibody determination is thought to suffice for clinical purposes. Experience from clinical trials of novel therapies has provided a new perspective on ANA expression during disease, as many patients with SLE are ANA negative at screening despite previously testing positive. Because trial results suggest that patients who are ANA negative might not respond to certain agents, screening strategies now involve ANA and anti-DNA antibody testing to identify patients with so-called 'active, autoantibody-positive SLE'. Evidence suggests that ANA responses can decrease over time because of the natural history of disease or the effects of therapy. Together, these findings suggest that, during established disease, more regular serological testing could illuminate changes relevant to pathogenesis and disease status.

### Historical perspective on antinuclear antibody testing [^1144ZAj9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum factors binding to cell nuclei were first described in the 1940s, and the antibodies responsible for the binding to self (autoantibodies) were discovered in the late 1950s. Routine standardized testing using a cell line (HEp-2) started in the 1980s and continues to evolve. In addition to the classic immunofluorescence assay (IFA), various immunochemical techniques have been developed for the measurement of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The complexity of ANA IFA pattern reading and the varying sensitivities, specificities, and overall clinical performance of the alternative methods have often generated controversies and sometimes even confusion among healthcare providers and laboratorians. A better understanding of the historical roots of ANA testing can aid in understanding these controversies and assist with selecting the best-performing methods. In this review, we present historic and contemporary ANA testing methods, highlighting the pros and cons of each. We also provide an overview of the current practice of ANA testing based on several recent large laboratory surveys. For optimal patient care, it is critical that clinicians and laboratorians using ANA testing understand the performance and limitations of the methods used by their institutions, as well as the meaning of the test results. Recently published surveys and standardization efforts initiated by several stakeholder scientific organizations will likely lead to new ANA diagnostic guidelines, to be followed by an improvement in testing practices, management, and outcomes for patients with autoimmune disorders.

### Evaluation of antinuclear antibody and subserology reflex testing for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorders in an academic teaching hospital [^112M7ZPH]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine appropriate utilization of antinuclear antibody (ANA) screening tests with follow-up subserology tests (reflex testing) for diagnosing systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorder (SARD).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 3003 SARD-test orders at an academic teaching hospital from January to December 2019. Testing patterns were categorized as American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-recommended reflex testing, panel testing, or single subserology testing. We described testing patterns, assessed their diagnostic accuracy, and explored factors associated with reflex testing.

Results

Reflex testing accounted for 79.7% of SARD test-ordering, whereas improper testing (panel or single subserology) accounted for the other 20.3%. Reflex testing was associated with significantly more SARD diagnoses than improper testing (P = 0.004). Testing patterns were significantly associated with race/ethnicity (P = 0.008), with reflex testing being less frequent than improper testing in Hispanics and Whites.

Conclusion

In summary, one-fifth (20.3%) of testing patterns for suspected SARD did not follow the ACR-recommended guidelines for using reflex testing. Use of reflex testing was associated with an increased frequency of SARD diagnosis.

### Relative value of commercial kits for ANA testing [^115q5VKi]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

We have tested the relative performance of 20 commercial ANA test kits along with that of our own laboratory to assess whether one was clearly superior.

Methods

The sera were drawn from 3 pools that had all been pre-tested in our laboratory: patients with definite SLE; patients with non-connective tissue diseases (CTD), but where a positive FANA had been found; and normal blood donors. The tests were used in accordance with the recommendations of the specific supplier but in a routine serology laboratory.

Results

Sensitivity and specificity ranged between 38 and 100%. While the negative predictive value of 4 ELISA kits was 100%, and most others were close, the HEp-2 kits were 100% in only 1 case. A positive predictive value of 100% was also seen with 1 kit.

Conclusion

Some of the tests are clearly better than others, but the choice may differ depending on the clinical needs, e.g. preference for a good positive or negative predictive value. However, the ELISA kits offered better results than the immunofluorescent technique. Two of them had sensitivity/specificity of > 90%.

### Cell-bound complement activation products in systemic lupus erythematosus: comparison with anti-double-stranded DNA and standard complement measurements [^114qH1xC]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains challenging partly because of the heterogeneity of the disease, its evolutive nature and also because there are significant limitations with currently available diagnostic immunology tests. In addition, SLE can be associated with irreversible and unpredictable organ damage, and the disease results in substantial economic burden to the patient and healthcare system. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis is critical. Currently, the diagnosis of SLE rests on a combination of clinical features (history and physical examination), other tests and immunological testing along with classification criteria.

Among the immunological laboratory measurements performed routinely, the detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is pivotal for screening purposes, owing to its high sensitivity. However, the ANA test is imperfect with a 10%–25% false positive rate among healthy individuals. More specific immunological tests such as antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and/or anti-Smith (anti-Sm) are also useful in diagnosing SLE, but these markers lack sensitivity. Other autoantibodies to cellular antigens including antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA: Sjogren's syndrome (SS)-A/Ro, SS-B/La, Centromere (CENP), Jo-1 U1RNP, scleroderma (Scl)-70) are also routinely measured in the clinical immunology laboratory, and while of value, none of these markers have sufficient predictive value on their own to differentiate SLE from other connective tissue diseases. Since patients with SLE often share many clinical features with other connective tissue diseases, the potential for misdiagnosis is not insignificant. It follows that the availability of more sensitive and specific diagnostic tests is highly desirable.

### Developing and refining new candidate criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus classification: an international collaboration [^112nBkjE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To define candidate criteria within multiphase development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria, jointly supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. Prior steps included item generation and reduction by Delphi exercise, further narrowed to 21 items in a nominal group technique exercise. Our objectives were to apply an evidence-based approach to the 21 candidate criteria, and to develop hierarchical organization of criteria within domains.

Methods

A literature review identified the sensitivity and specificity of the 21 candidate criteria. Data on the performance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion and operating characteristics of the candidate criteria in early SLE patients were evaluated. Candidate criteria were hierarchically organized into clinical and immunologic domains, and definitions were refined in an iterative process.

Results

Based on the data, consensus was reached to use a positive ANA of ≥ 1:80 titer (HEp-2 cells immunofluorescence) as an entry criterion and to have 7 clinical and 3 immunologic domains, with hierarchical organization of criteria within domains. Definitions of the candidate criteria were specified.

Conclusion

Using a data-driven process, consensus was reached on new, refined criteria definitions and organization based on operating characteristics. This work will be followed by a multicriteria decision analysis exercise to weight criteria and to identify a threshold score for classification on a continuous probability scale.

### Discrepant anti-dsDNA testing between eliA andin ANA negative samples: just a false positive? [^111Rom8y]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In consequence, we agree that CLIFT must be performed to confirm positive solid-phase DA assays if the clinical purpose is SARD diagnosis, but not for monitoring. We also fully agree that it is important to take into account possible false positives in discrepant samples, mainly in the low positive range of values. In addition, we think that the EliA dsDNA cut-off values should be upregulated without a significant loss of sensitivity in order to improve its clinical relevance. Further studies are needed in this way.

Finally, we emphasise the importance of maintaining a close collaboration between autoimmunity laboratory specialists and clinicians, to enhance mutual understanding of their respective needs and findings — specially in the case of discrepant results — ultimately benefiting the patient management.

### Utility of repeat extractable nuclear antigen antibody testing: a retrospective audit [^11256GV5]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Autoantibodies to ENA are frequently ordered during the workup of suspected autoimmune connective tissue diseases. There are no current guidelines for repeat test ordering. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of repeat ENA testing after an initial negative result.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted in a single, multicentre tertiary health network in Melbourne, Australia. Results of all ENA tests were extracted from the hospital laboratory information system. For patients who had a change in ENA result from negative to positive, clinical information was obtained from the hospital records regarding new diagnosis of an ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD).

Results

A total of 23438 ENA tests were performed in 19603 patients from 29 July 2013 to 28 September 2020. In total, 20918 (89.2%) were negative with 215 (0.9%) being equivocal. Of the 2305 positive tests, the most common ENA auto-antibody specificity detected was anti-Ro52 (1185, 51.4%). A total of 2636 of 19603 patients (13.4%) had more than one ENA test performed during the study period. Of these, most (2523, 95.7%) had stable ENA results with no change compared with the first test. Only 53 patients (2.2%) had an ENA result that changed from negative to positive. Excluding patients with pre-existing rheumatic conditions and those under 18, there were five new AARDs found in the remaining 34 patients.

Conclusion

Repeat ENA test results rarely change or result in a new diagnosis of an AARD, with repeated testing only warranted if there is a change in clinical manifestations.

Results

Study population

In BioVU, there were 12 639 individuals with genotype data available and an ANA test done as part of their clinical care. We excluded individuals with at least one diagnostic code for SLE or common autoimmune diseases known to be associated with a positive ANA (n = 4424, online supplemental table S1), those without an ANA titre reported or with a titre of 1:40 (n = 863), those who were also included in the eMERGE cohort (n = 801) and those from ancestries other than European (n = 1177). Characteristics of the eligible ANA individuals are shown in online supplemental table S2. In addition, there were 65 374 general controls and 662 patients with SLE.

In eMERGE, individuals with an ANA test performed as part of their clinical care (n = 4896) were selected, and individuals with a diagnostic code for a common autoimmune disease (n = 2688) as well as those from ancestries other than European (n = 1495) were excluded.

Investigations

The results of the investigations considered in this questionnaire are listed in Table 2, including the recommendations of both the Dutch national guideline and ESHRE. Most respondents initiate investigations after two pregnancy losses (87.3%; n = 324/371), and start with obtaining information on general aspects such as body weight and length (93.3%; n = 348/373), and lifestyle (90.2%; n = 343/373).

* Not indicated

† Number indicated regards percentage of respondents that perform karyotyping according to individual risk assessment table

BMI: Body Mass Index; ACA: Anticardiolipin Antibodies; TSH: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone; TPO: Thyroid Peroxidase; HSG: Hysterosalpingography; SIS: Saline Infusion Sonohysterography; HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; NK: Natural Killer; HLA: Human Leukocyte Antibiodies; ANA: Antinuclear Antibodies

According to the questionnaire, approximately 70% of respondents initiate parental karyotyping after risk assessment based upon the maternal age at second miscarriage, number of preceding miscarriages and history of miscarriages in either the siblings or in the parents. 20% responded that they always perform parental karyotyping. Genetic testing on pregnancy tissue after miscarriages is performed by 2.2% (n = 8/363) of respondents. Both guidelines recommend karyotyping only on indication. The ESHRE recommends pregnancy tissue testing only for explanatory purposes.

Almost all participants offer APS investigations (98.9%; n = 346/350); lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are generally performed by most participants (see Table 2), anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies testing is performed by less than half of respondents (IgM testing: 36.9%; n = 129/350 and IgG testing: 42.3%; n = 148/350). Both guidelines recommend APS testing.

### New classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^112pyiZY]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To compare the recently published European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Centers (SLICC) criteria and the earlier ACR criteria, focusing on their key concepts.

Recent Findings

Although the SLICC criteria introduced numbers of new criteria items, the new EULAR/ACR criteria added only noninfectious fever, based on an early SLE cohort study and an SLE patient survey, and condensed hematological, mucocutaneous and neurological items. Whereas the SLICC criteria maintained the overall structure familiar from the ACR criteria, the EULAR /ACR criteria use antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an obligatory entry criterion, have weighted criteria and group these in domains. Where the SLICC criteria greatly increased sensitivity, losing some specificity, the EULAR/ACR criteria increased specificity again, for excellent classification criteria performance.

Summary

Despite differences in structure and statistical performance, the EULAR/ACR and SLICC criteria agree on the importance of both immunological and clinical findings, on the high impact of lupus nephritis by histology, and on most clinical items.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^113m6VC4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The question why the ANA test is so frequently positive in populations without an autoimmune disease remains a fascinating one. It suggests that the breaking of immunological tolerance is really quite common, but that this tolerance breakdown only rarely leads to disease. It is possible that antinuclear antibodies have some useful function that is not yet fully understood.

However, the ANA test has such a high false-positivity rate that a positive test is of little, if any, clinical utility as a screening test and should not be ordered routinely to screen children with musculoskeletal complaints. Its use should be limited to the diagnosis of SLE, MCTD, and similar systemic illnesses. If the test is performed, low titer ANA results (< 1:640) in most cases should be ignored unless the child is systemically ill and shows signs of SLE or a similar systemic disease.

### Diagnostic evaluation of ELISA and chemiluminescent assays as alternative screening tests to indirect immunofluorescence for the detection of antibodies to cellular antigens [^111G7u4N]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) plays an important role in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD). Our goal was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of three commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and one chemiluminescent assay for ANA detection, using the clinical diagnostic as the reference standard.

Methods

We evaluated serum samples from 143 patients with an established diagnosis of SARD (group 1), 166 patients with infectious diseases and other rheumatic diseases for which the ANA test is not useful in diagnosis (group 2), and 89 outpatients with suspicion of SARD (group 3).

Results

The sensitivity for ANA HEp-2, calculated in group 1, was 87.4% and varied between 62.9% and 90.0% for other tests. The specificity for ANA HEp-2, calculated in group 2, was 72.3% and varied between 45.2% and 90.4% for other tests. In group 3, the negative predictive value for ANA Hep-2 was 92.5% and varied between 89.3% and 100% for other tests.

Conclusions

Some ELISA kits have comparable or superior diagnostic sensitivity to ANA HEp-2 and could be used as an alternative method for ANA screening, therefore allowing the immediate report of the results with fewer false negatives than ANA HEp-2. Owing to the lower specificity, ELISA-positive samples should be submitted to ANA HEp-2 for confirmation of results.

### The clinical utility of a positive antinuclear antibody test result [^112xNQSS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This retrospective study investigated the clinical utility of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test performed outside of the rheumatology setting. Prior studies have investigated the frequency of ANA positivity within the general population. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical utility of a positive ANA test result in a real-world setting by reviewing the final diagnoses of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for evaluation of a positive ANA test result.

Methods

We reviewed the records of patients presenting to the authors between July 2007 and July 2009. Patients were included in the evaluation if they were referred for a positive ANA test result. All relevant descriptive and laboratory data were collated, as were the initial reasons for ordering ANA testing and the ultimate diagnoses reached. Positive predictive values for a "positive ANA test result" were calculated for all antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic diseases and for lupus specifically.

Results

A total of 232 patients were referred for a positive ANA test result. The positive predictive value of a positive ANA test result in this cohort was 2.1% for lupus and 9.1% for any antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease. No antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease was identified in patients with an ANA < 1:160. The most common reason for ordering ANA testing was widespread pain (54/232, 23.2%).

Conclusions

In this retrospective study, more than 90% of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for a positive ANA test result had no evidence for an ANA-associated rheumatic disease. The poor predictive value of a positive ANA in this cohort was largely attributable to unnecessary testing in patients with low pretest probabilities for ANA-associated rheumatic disease.

### Use of rheumatology laboratory studies among primary pediatricians [^1166NvTR]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Rheumatology laboratory tests are often inappropriately ordered in situations for which they are of low diagnostic utility. We surveyed pediatricians to investigate reasons for ordering these tests. The response rate was 15.3% (93/609). The most commonly ordered tests were antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody, and rheumatoid factor (RF). Of the 89% (83/93) who ordered an ANA, 86% ordered it for correct/possibly correct reasons; of the 73% (68/93) who ordered RF, 80% did so for correct/possibly correct reasons; and among the 59% (54/92) who had ordered anti-dsDNA antibody, 34% ordered it for correct reasons. A positive relationship was seen between years since residency completion and correct use of ANA. However, positive associations were not seen between measures of pediatric rheumatology experience and correct use of other tests. Interventions are needed to improve pediatricians' utilization of rheumatology tests.

### Performance of antinuclear antibodies for classifying systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic literature review and meta-regression of diagnostic data [^111FfXxZ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published literature on the performance of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)-HEp-2 antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing for classification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published between January 1990 and October 2015. The research question was structured according to Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format rules, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations were followed where appropriate. Meta-regression analysis for diagnostic tests was performed, using the ANA titer as independent variable, while sensitivity and specificity were dependent variables.

Results

Of 4,483 publications screened, 62 matched the eligibility criteria, and another 2 articles were identified through reference analysis. The included studies comprised 13,080 SLE patients in total, of whom 12,542 (95.9%) were reported to be IIF-ANA positive at various titers. For ANA at titers of 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320, meta-regression gave sensitivity values of 98.4% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 97.6–99.0%), 97.8% (95% CI 96.8–98.5%), 95.8% (95% CI 94.1–97.1%), and 86.0% (95% CI 77.0–91.9%), respectively. The corresponding specificities were 66.9% (95% CI 57.8–74.9%), 74.7% (95% CI 66.7–81.3%), 86.2% (95% CI 80.4–90.5%), and 96.6% (95% CI 93.9–98.1%), respectively.

Conclusion

The results of this systematic literature review and meta-regression confirm that IIF-ANAs have high sensitivity for SLE. ANAs at a titer of 1:80 have sufficiently high sensitivity to be considered as an entry criterion for SLE classification criteria, i.e., formally test other classification criteria for SLE only if ANAs of at least 1:80 have been found.

### 2019 European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^113ZHKpZ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop new classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) jointly supported by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).

Methods

This international initiative had four phases. 1) Evaluation of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion through systematic review and meta-regression of the literature and criteria generation through an international Delphi exercise, an early patient cohort, and a patient survey. 2) Criteria reduction by Delphi and nominal group technique exercises. 3) Criteria definition and weighting based on criterion performance and on results of a multi-criteria decision analysis. 4) Refinement of weights and threshold scores in a new derivation cohort of 1,001 subjects and validation compared with previous criteria in a new validation cohort of 1,270 subjects.

Results

The 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE include positive ANA at least once as obligatory entry criterion; followed by additive weighted criteria grouped in 7 clinical (constitutional, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, mucocutaneous, serosal, musculoskeletal, renal) and 3 immunologic (antiphospholipid antibodies, complement proteins, SLE-specific antibodies) domains, and weighted from 2 to 10. Patients accumulating ≥ 10 points are classified. In the validation cohort, the new criteria had a sensitivity of 96.1% and specificity of 93.4%, compared with 82.8% sensitivity and 93.4% specificity of the ACR 1997 and 96.7% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics 2012 criteria.

Conclusion

These new classification criteria were developed using rigorous methodology with multidisciplinary and international input, and have excellent sensitivity and specificity. Use of ANA entry criterion, hierarchically clustered, and weighted criteria reflects current thinking about SLE and provides an improved foundation for SLE research.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^113Sm7Dn]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Establishing a diagnosis of SLE is currently based on clinical acumen, laboratory testing and adaptive use of criteria that were designed to classify participants for clinical research. A young woman presenting with a photosensitive malar rash, non-erosive arthritis and typical autoantibodies would not stump an experienced rheumatologist or dermatologist. Complicated diagnostic algorithms in such a scenario are unnecessary. However, the problem of lupus diagnosis extends far beyond this type of presentation on both sides of the equation, the patient and the provider. On the patient side, early detection of SLE remains a challenge. Recent analyses suggest that many patients with SLE present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, fatigue or arthritis, rather than more typical lupus findings such as malar rash. On the provider side of the equation, such patients are most likely to present to primary care physicians or advanced practice providers who are unlikely to be thinking of a rare disease like SLE, and who may not see a need for rheumatological consultation. Delay in getting such a patient to a rheumatologist or lupus specialist is further complicated by the poor performance of the ANA which is the major screening diagnostic. The ANA is extremely sensitive for lupus, but has a high prevalence in the normal populationmaking it too non-specific to be very useful as a screening test. When an ANA-positive patient is referred to a busy rheumatology practice, there is no sense of urgency if other lupus-suggestive symptoms or laboratory tests are not present. In some rheumatology practices, more than 10%–15% of incoming requests for consultation are for evaluation of ANA positivity, so this is not a small problem. Some of these ANA-positive individuals are in an early stage of an evolving lupus syndrome, but identification of those who are at risk is not readily accomplished with available laboratory tests. Therefore, during what can be a long wait time to evaluation, it is likely that some of these ANA-positive patients will have evolution of disease with development of damage at the time of presentation to the lupus specialist. Even nephropathy has been seen in a significant proportion of early lupus cohorts.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of having SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of ANA, ENA and other novel antigen testing?

A total of 518 publications were identified in the initial clinical evidence review for this section. Following initial screening 417 records were removed. This left 101 full-text articles of which a further 81 were excluded for a variety of reasons. The remaining 20 studies were included in the meta-analysis for this section.

Given the evolution of the classification criteria over time direct comparisons between publications can be difficult.

Six studies were identified exploring the diagnostic accuracy of ANA in SD, all but one included a wider population than suspected SD. See Table 1 for details. Five of these studies were retrospective cohort studies. The quality of the studies were graded from very low to moderate. Overall, these studies estimated the sensitivity of ANA as between 58% and 85% and the specificity as between 50% and 97%. The only study that confined itself to people with suspected SD (all had sicca) and scored moderate on GRADE found a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 50%. Median ages for subjects in these studies ranged from 39 to 60 years. No correlation was reported between age and ANA positivity.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of ANA in SD and various CTDs

Three studies were identified exploring the diagnostic accuracy of ENA — although none was specific for SD. See Table 2 for details. The studies were graded as low quality due to risk of bias. Results showed that the estimated sensitivity for ENA ranged between 89% and 92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of ENA in SD

All three studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of ENA in patients with a variety of underlying CTD including SD. The ENA panels used varied between 6-, 7-, 9- and 14-test ENA panels, and also included one multiplex bead–based immunoassay (MPBI). One study used two different tests which between them included testing for dsDNA, U1RNP, Sm, Ro/SSA60 and 52, La/SSB, Scl-70, Pm-scl, Jo-1, CENP, PCNA, nucleosomes, histones, ribosomal-P and AMA-M2. Only 19 of the patients had clinical SD.

### Guidelines for the laboratory use of autoantibody tests in the diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^113RQWTQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

The Italian Society of Laboratory Medicine Study Group on the Diagnosis of Autoimmune Diseases has generated a series of guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases intendedfor the use of clinical pathologists and laboratory physicians. These guidelines are based on a systematic review of published works and expert panel discussion and consist of 13 recommendations for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded native DNA, and antinuclear specific antibodies. To improve analytic performances and help select the most appropriate test for specific autoantibodies, as well as provide education and guidance in the use of these tests, special emphasis is placed on laboratory methods.

### Different indirect immunofluorescence ANA substrate performance in a diagnostic setting of patients with SLE and related disorders: retrospective review and analysis [^11123ciQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, ANA seroconversion (negative to positive) occurred even within 2 years of initial testing using the same assay. In 2002, an ACR committee suggested that due to a lack of evidence, 'serial ANA testing is of unknown value'. ANA positivity may change with fluctuations in antibodies such as anti-dsDNA, which in turn correlate with disease activity, and it has also been established that autoantibodies start to be detectable and specificities accumulate prior to the onset of SLE. One retrospective cohort study of 36 715 ANA tests done in 28 840 patients found that 19% of patients with an initially negative ANA HEp-2 test had a positive result on at least one repeat test on the same ANA kit over a 7-year period (median time to first positive result 1.74 years). In addition, patients with SLE may lose ANA positivity with decreasing ANA titres over the disease course, as shown in a small prospective study of 54 recently diagnosed SLE cases followed up to 96 months. We recommend that future larger studies should longitudinally examine different ANA, autoantibodies and their assays to maximise the utility of diagnosis and monitoring of SLE and other ARDs.

### Don't test antinuclear antibodies (ANA) subserologies… [^117WDZbc]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Tests for ANA subserologies are usually negative if the ANA is negative. Exceptions include anti-Jo1, which can be positive in some forms of myositis, or occasionally, anti-SSA, in the setting of lupus or Sjögren syndrome. Broad testing of autoantibodies should be avoided; instead, the choice of autoantibodies should be guided by the specific disease under consideration.

### Measurements of endpoint titers based on the fluorescence intensity trend in anti-nuclear antibody testing [^116jdSd7]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Automated systems for antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing provide endpoint titers that are predicted based on the fluorescence intensity (FI) value at a screening dilution (single-well titration [SWT]) showing frequent titration errors (more than plus or minus 1 dilution).

Methods

Line slope titration (LST) was based on the trend of FI values on dilutions. Three dilutions per specimen were prepared considering a patient's previous titer or FI at the screening dilution. On the XY plot, with the reciprocal of dilution as the X-axis and FI value as the Y-axis, a fitted line was drawn to obtain the endpoint titers.

Results

The titration error rate (no. of errors/total no.) of LST using a regression line was lower than that of SWT (31/710 [4.4%] and 152/674 [22.6%], respectively; P < .000000001), with serial dilution as a reference. When comparing a regression line using 3 dilution points with a line using 2 dilution points, the error rate of the former was not significantly different from that of the latter (31/710 [4.4%] and 31/746 [4.2%], respectively; p = 0.842).

Conclusions

This LST method is useful as an accurate, cost-effective, and rapid approach to measure endpoint titers in routine ANA testing.

### Application of a combined protocol for rational request and utilization of antibody assays improves clinical diagnostic efficacy in autoimmune rheumatic disease [^1161FRkX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Because of a marked increase in the number of requests for antinuclear antibodies, anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies for the diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic disease, guidelines have been proposed for their appropriate use.

Objective

To evaluate in terms of clinical efficacy and cost-benefit ratio the outcome of applying a protocol for the diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic disease.

Design

A diagnostic protocol for the rational utilization of second-level tests (anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies) was applied at Hospital Polyclinic beginning January 2004. The appropriateness of 685 consecutive requests received at the clinical pathology laboratory from January to June 2004 was assessed. Patients who underwent these laboratory tests were followed up for 12 months after blood sample drawing.

Results

Introduction of the protocol led to a significant reduction in the number of second-level tests prescribed (27.9% vs 49.5% for anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies; 27.5% vs 56.6% for anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies). After the period of observation, none of the 163 patients who had negative results on the first-level test and were asymptomatic, for whom second-level tests had not therefore been performed, were found to have autoimmune rheumatic disease. In 90.5% (77/85) of patients positive for the second-level tests, clinical confirmation of autoimmune rheumatic disease was obtained.

Conclusions

Not only did application of the diagnostic protocol reduce the number of second-level tests performed but it also increased their specificity. Our data thus indicate that the use of shared guidelines by clinical and laboratory specialists yields satisfactory results.

### Cost-effective detection of non-antidouble-stranded DNA antinuclear antibody specificities in daily clinical practice [^114xFRu8]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the utility of indirect immunofluorescence for the detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANA-IIF) and a fully automated test (ELiA Symphony) that detects antibodies against a mixture of nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens (ENA), to select sera that should be tested for non-antidouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antinuclear antibodies in a relatively expensive automated line immunoassay (INNO-LIA ANA update, Lineblot).

Methods

All 328 sera sent to the laboratory for ANA or anti-ENA tests, over a 4 month period were evaluated in all three assays. Results were related to signs and symptoms of systemic autoimmune disease (AID) that patients had before or at the time of blood sampling.

Results

Overall, 72 (22%) sera were Lineblot positive. Of 198 patients without clinical manifestations of AID, 7% were Lineblot positive. Limiting Lineblot to sera positive in either ANA-IIF or Symphony tests failed to detect 26 (ANA-IIF) and 22 (Symphony) Lineblot-reactive sera, with 15 sera being negative in both assays. From a clinical point of view, failure to detect these reactivities was not important in most cases.

Conclusions

Restriction of performance of Lineblot to patients with at least one criterion for AID is an ideal and cost-effective strategy. In ignorance of clinical signs and symptoms, screening of sera by ANA-IIF or Symphony strongly reduces the costs of anti-ENA detection, with minimal loss in diagnostic capacity. Based on small differences, including the fact that anti-dsDNA antibodies give a positive ANA-IIF, we prefer screening with ANA-IIF over Symphony.

### Should antinuclear antibodies (ANA) be used to screen for connective tissue disease in neurological patients? [^115i2ptt]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD) can have a wide range of neurological manifestations. Neurological complaints may be the presenting symptom of CTD. Therefore, screening for CTD using anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) is a common practice. However, due to the abundance of positive ANA in a healthy population, interpretation of the results may be complex.

Methods

we retrospectively evaluated files of patients hospitalized for evaluation of neurological symptoms in Sheba Medical Center during the years 2007–2022. Data was collected regarding epidemiology, ANA status, and rheumatological diagnosis.

Results

4723 patients' files were reviewed. Of them, 46.6% were positive for ANA. 6.9% of them were diagnosed with CTD. This population had significantly higher rates of positive ANA status (71.2% vs 28.8%, p < 0.001), was significantly older (59.4 vs 53.4 years, p < 0.001) and had a significantly higher ANA titer (1:484.8, 1:268 p < 0.001) compared to patients without CTD. Factors which were found predictive for CTD diagnosis included female gender, older age, ANA titer above 1:160, and the diagnosis of a non-vascular etiology for the neurological disease.

Conclusion

Females, older patients, patients with high ANA titer and with diagnosis of a non-vascular cause to their neurological complains may be more likely to harbor a CTD and should probably be further evaluated.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^114Nb9Ak]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Referrals for positive ANA titers

As part of a study exploring what precipitated a referral to a pediatric rheumatologist, McGhee et al. found that children referred, at least in part, because of a positive ANA test were no more likely to have a chronic inflammatory disease than children with a negative test.

In another study from a pediatric rheumatology clinic, only 55% of all of the children with a positive ANA test had an inflammatory rheumatic disease. Positive antibodies to double-stranded DNA or to extractable nuclear antigens (Sm, RNP) indicating SLE or MCTD were strongly correlated with an ANA titer ≥ 1:640. The authors recommended therefore, that these more specific tests be performed only if the child had a positive ANA test at high titer.

McGhee and colleagues reviewed the ANA titer clinical utility in 2004. One hundred and ten children were evaluated who had been referred for a positive ANA. Of the 110, 10 subsequently were found to have SLE, 18 had JRA, 1 had MCTD, and 1 had Raynaud's phenomenon. Neither a positive ANA neither titer nor the degree of positivity of the ANA helped pick out the children with SLE from the children without a chronic inflammatory disease. Tellingly, it wasn't the elevated ANA titer that distinguished the children with JRA from those with other musculoskeletal problems, but the history (e.g. morning stiffness) and the physical exam (e.g. presence of rash, swollen joints).

All these studies demonstrate that a positive ANA test is found frequently in a pediatric hospital population, and even in high titer has only a poor ability to determine whether a child has an inflammatory rheumatic disease.

### Rheumatologic tests: a primer for family physicians [^117BEZ5q]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with a suspected connective tissue disorder should undergo serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis and, in some cases, to monitor disease activity and predict flares. Patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should be tested for antinuclear antibodies. However, antinuclear antibodies are not specific and may be present in many other connective tissue disorders and nonrheumatologic diseases. Thus, patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with Sjögren syndrome may have a positive antinuclear antibody titer, but often also have positive anti-Sjögren antigen A or B results. Similarly, antinuclear antibodies can be present in patients with scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, and dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Additional tests are needed to help confirm the diagnosis. In patients with findings of rheumatoid arthritis, a positive rheumatoid factor titer suggests the diagnosis, but as with antinuclear antibodies, it is not specific and can occur in other conditions. Rheumatoid factor can also be negative in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A positive anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titer is more specific for rheumatoid arthritis and can help confirm the diagnosis. Physicians should order these serologic tests only when patients have a high pretest probability of a specific connective tissue disorder.

### Appropriateness in anti-nuclear antibody testing: from clinical request to strategic laboratory practice [^115SqYa4]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

As a result of rapid changes in laboratory technology, clinical behaviour and patients' expectations, along with limited economic resources, there is a greater requirement for an appropriate use of autoantibody testing. We examine the various aspects and the most controversial points of the diagnostic procedure in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and make recommendations for the most efficient approach to autoantibody testing, based on selected publications and the relevant literature. Appropriateness is a complex task that can be achieved only by combining the efforts from the laboratory and the clinic, thereby using scientific knowledge, inter-disciplinary consultation and expert clinical investigation.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^114d6T7p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The antinuclear antibody test (ANA) is a much overused test in pediatrics. The ANA does have a role in serologic testing but it should be a very limited one. It is often ordered as a screening test for rheumatic illnesses in a primary care setting. However, since it has low specificity and sensitivity for most rheumatic and musculoskeletal illnesses in children, it should not be ordered as a screening test for non-specific complaints such as musculoskeletal pain. It should only be used as a diagnostic test for children with probable Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, (MCTD) and other possible overlap-like illnesses. Such children should have developed definite signs and symptoms of a disease before the ANA is ordered. This review presents data supporting these conclusions and a review of the ANA literature in adults and children. By limiting ANA testing, primary care providers can avoid needless venipuncture pain, unnecessary referrals, extra medical expenses, and most importantly, significant parental anxieties. It is best not to do the ANA test in most children but if it ordered and is positive in a low titer (< 1:640), the results can be ignored if the child is otherwise well and does not have other features of a systemic illness.

### Validation of a new screening strategy for anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies [^111KwkZa]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is the most widely applied screening test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), it lacks specificity for the identification of specific diseases or antigen reactivities. The aim of the present study was to validate an anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screening strategy encompassing a three-step cascade whereby an ELISA with pooled specific ENA is positioned between the IIF and the final anti-ENA identification.

Methods

Sera from 4 populations were tested for anti-ENA using an automated ELISA (EliA Symphony) and a line immunoassay (INNO-LIA ANA update).

Results

At the manufacturer's cut-off, a 96% sensitivity (95% CI 94%-98%) and 96% specificity (95% CI 94%-98%) of EliA Symphony for anti-ENA was obtained in a consecutive selection of 328 IIF positive serum samples referred for ANA testing. In addition, a high sensitivity was demonstrated for anti-ENA reactivities in patients with SLE (99%, 95% CI 97%-101%) and SSc (100%), and for anti-ENA monoreactivities.

Conclusion

The EliA Symphony test was shown to be a sensitive second-line screening test for anti-ENA antibodies. In the context of a high clinical suspicion of connective tissue disease or autoreactivities not included in the EliA Symphony assay, third-line testing may be useful, even if the anti-ENA screening is negative.
