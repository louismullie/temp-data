## Question

How long is oral antibiotic therapy used for in cystic acne

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long oral antibiotics are typically prescribed for cystic acne and how to structure the course safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes cystic acne and its usual treatment hierarchy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for duration of systemic antibiotics. Next, I will examine the evidence on antibiotic resistance and why duration limits matter. After that, I need to check real-world prescribing patterns to see how often guidelines are followed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned plan with contingencies for nonresponse and special populations, and confirm the bottom-line recommendation with references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: cystic acne represents severe nodulocystic disease with deep, often painful lesions that carry a high risk of scarring and psychosocial impact, so systemic therapy is frequently indicated, but I need to ensure we do not conflate cystic acne with cystic fibrosis, which is a different disease entirely and not relevant to acne antibiotic duration decisions [^117X6w8n] [^112LPiES].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline recommendations on duration. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2024 guidelines advise limiting systemic antibiotic use to the shortest possible duration, with reassessment at 3–4 months to minimize resistance, and they strongly discourage monotherapy, recommending combination with topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. They also note insufficient evidence to support long-term minocycline maintenance beyond 3–4 months, which reinforces the short-course principle [^113ZdjTj] [^113Wi2sn] [^115t8qgP]. Hold on, I should verify international guidance: the European S3 guideline similarly recommends avoiding long-term systemic antibiotics and not using them for maintenance, aligning with a 3–6 month ceiling in many European summaries, while NICE guidance often cites 3–6 months as acceptable, reflecting a conservative upper bound consistent with stewardship [^116cay7R] [^111sXWYh] [^116Z9EP4].

> I will now examine the rationale for limiting duration. Prolonged systemic antibiotic exposure drives Cutibacterium acnes resistance and perturbs the microbiome, with clinical consequences; stewardship strategies include avoiding monotherapy, using benzoyl peroxide to mitigate resistance, and keeping courses short, ideally no longer than 3 months when possible, with 6 months as an upper limit in select cases under close supervision [^116uBu43] [^114uZCHG] [^116Z9EP4]. Wait, let me verify the resistance data: multiple reviews document rising macrolide and tetracycline resistance globally, underscoring why extended or repeated antibiotic courses without maintenance topicals are problematic [^114uZCHG] [^116uBu43].

> Next, I should review real-world practice to see if clinicians actually adhere to these limits. Retrospective claims analyses show that many patients remain on oral antibiotics beyond 3–6 months, with roughly 18–20% exceeding 6 months in several cohorts, and a UK primary care study found a median cumulative exposure of about 8.5 months across multiple courses, indicating frequent repeat use and prolonged total exposure despite guideline targets [^112Gm3BM] [^112PhMcG] [^114FjnyP]. Hold on, I should double-check the isotretinoin pathway: patients who ultimately require isotretinoin often accumulate months to over a year of prior antibiotic exposure, suggesting delayed escalation and unnecessary cumulative antibiotic burden [^114jZnRc].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach. For cystic acne, initiate a tetracycline-class antibiotic (doxycycline or minocycline, or lymecycline where available) combined with a topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide from the outset, and plan a finite course with a hard stop at 3 months if feasible. If disease is severe and response is still evolving, extending toward 6 months is acceptable, but only with documented benefit and ongoing justification, and with explicit transition planning to non-antibiotic maintenance or isotretinoin if scarring risk or refractoriness is present [^113ZdjTj] [^113Wi2sn] [^111sXWYh]. I need to ensure I include alternatives: for women with hormonally influenced acne, spironolactone or combined oral contraceptives can reduce reliance on antibiotics; for severe nodulocystic or scarring disease, isotretinoin remains the most effective therapy and should be considered early rather than after prolonged, repeated antibiotic exposure [^111sXWYh] [^111XYwS1] [^1132E26A].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or cannot take tetracyclines? I should confirm exceptions. In pregnancy, tetracyclines are contraindicated; short courses of oral erythromycin or cephalexin may be considered for a few weeks in select inflammatory cases, always with benzoyl peroxide to mitigate resistance, and with careful risk–benefit discussion given limited efficacy and resistance concerns [^113iodRZ]. For children under 8 years, tetracyclines are generally avoided; macrolides may be used short term if needed, again in combination with benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids when appropriate [^113ZdjTj].

> I should confirm the bottom line and make sure I am not overgeneralizing. The consensus target is 3 months of oral antibiotics for cystic acne when used, with an absolute ceiling of 6 months in exceptional circumstances, always in combination with topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide, and with reassessment at 3–4 months to decide on de-escalation, maintenance, or escalation to isotretinoin; prolonged or repeated antibiotic exposure without a maintenance plan is not supported by guidelines and increases resistance risk [^113ZdjTj] [^113Wi2sn] [^111sXWYh] [^114uZCHG].

---

Oral antibiotics for cystic acne should be limited to **3–4 months** [^113ZdjTj] to balance efficacy with resistance risk [^116uBu43]; **never use as monotherapy** [^113Wi2sn] and always pair with topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide [^113679yM]. If there is inadequate response by 3 months, reassess and escalate to isotretinoin or alternative therapy [^115TrYKP]; prolonged use increases resistance and adverse effects without added benefit [^notfound].

---

## Recommended duration of oral antibiotic therapy

Current guidelines consistently recommend **limiting oral antibiotic therapy** for acne to the shortest effective duration, typically 3–4 months [^113ZdjTj]. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2024 guidelines explicitly advise limiting systemic antibiotic use to the shortest possible duration, with reassessment at 3–4 months to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^115TrYKP] [^113xX53G]. Similarly, the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guidelines emphasize avoiding long-term systemic antibiotic therapy and recommend limiting treatment to 3–4 months [^116cay7R].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration limits

Several studies and reviews highlight the risks of **prolonged antibiotic use**, including increased antibiotic resistance, microbiome disruption, and adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, candidiasis, and potential links to inflammatory bowel disease [^116xjWk8]. A systematic review published in JAMA Dermatology (2017) underscores the importance of limiting antibiotic duration and **avoiding monotherapy** to reduce resistance [^116uBu43]. Moreover, prolonged antibiotic use beyond 3–4 months **does not confer additional therapeutic benefit** and may exacerbate resistance [^114uZCHG].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

Clinical studies consistently demonstrate that **oral antibiotics** effectively reduce inflammatory lesions within the first 3 months of therapy [^112b6Ykv]. Extending therapy beyond this period does not significantly improve outcomes and increases the **risk of resistance and adverse effects** [^notfound]. Therefore, the recommended duration of **3–4 months** strikes a balance between efficacy and safety [^112Gm3BM].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of prolonged antibiotic therapy

Prolonged oral antibiotic therapy for cystic acne is associated with several risks and adverse effects, including:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased resistance in Cutibacterium acnes and other bacteria, compromising future treatment efficacy [^116uBu43] [^114uZCHG].
- **Microbiome disruption**: Alteration of normal skin and gut microbiota, potentially leading to gastrointestinal issues and secondary infections [^111Y1gKc] [^116xjWk8].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal disturbances, photosensitivity, candidiasis, and rare but serious adverse effects such as drug-induced lupus and hepatitis [^116eRejQ].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Potential association with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, although evidence remains inconclusive [^116xjWk8].

Given these risks, it is imperative to adhere to the recommended duration limits and avoid unnecessary prolongation of antibiotic therapy [^113ZdjTj].

---

## Alternative treatments and maintenance strategies

Upon completion of the recommended 3–4 month antibiotic course, **alternative treatments and maintenance strategies** should be implemented to sustain clinical improvement and prevent relapse:

- **Topical retinoids**: Continued use of topical retinoids (e.g. adapalene, tretinoin) helps maintain clearance and prevent new lesion formation [^113Wi2sn].
- **Benzoyl peroxide**: Topical benzoyl peroxide is recommended to reduce resistance and maintain antimicrobial activity [^114uZCHG].
- **Hormonal therapies**: In females, hormonal therapies such as combined oral contraceptives or spironolactone may be considered to manage persistent acne [^111sXWYh].
- **Isotretinoin**: For severe, refractory, or scarring acne, isotretinoin remains the gold standard and should be considered early to avoid prolonged antibiotic exposure [^1132E26A] [^111XYwS1].

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral antibiotic therapy for cystic acne should be limited to **3–4 months** to balance efficacy with resistance and safety concerns [^113ZdjTj]. Prolonged use beyond this duration does not provide additional benefit and increases the risk of resistance and adverse effects [^114uZCHG]. Clinicians should adhere to guideline recommendations, avoid monotherapy, and implement alternative treatments and maintenance strategies to sustain clinical improvement and minimize relapse [^113Wi2sn].

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### Oral isotretinoin for acne [^1132E26A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit associated with socialisation and mental health problems, may affect more than 80% of teenagers. Isotretinoin is the only drug that targets all primary causal factors of acne; however, it may cause adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess efficacy and safety of oral isotretinoin for acne vulgaris.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to July 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and LILACS. We updated this search in March 2018, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We also searched five trial registries, checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant trials, and handsearched dermatology conference proceedings. A separate search for adverse effects of oral isotretinoin was undertaken in MEDLINE and Embase up to September 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of oral isotretinoin in participants with clinically diagnosed acne compared against placebo, any other systemic or topical active therapy, and itself in different formulation, doses, regimens, or course duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 31 RCTs, involving 3836 participants (12 to 55 years) with mild to severe acne. There were twice as many male participants as females. Most studies were undertaken in Asia, Europe, and North America. Outcomes were generally measured between eight to 32 weeks (mean 19.7 weeks) of therapy. Assessed comparisons included oral isotretinoin versus placebo or other treatments such as antibiotics. In addition, different doses, regimens, or formulations of oral isotretinoin were assessed, as well as oral isotretinoin with the addition of topical agents. Pharmaceutical companies funded 12 included trials. All, except three studies, had high risk of bias in at least one domain. Oral isotretinoin compared with oral antibiotics plus topical agentsThese studies included participants with moderate or severe acne and assessed outcomes immediately after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment (short-term). Three studies (400 participants) showed isotretinoin makes no difference in terms of decreasing trial investigator-assessed inflammatory lesion count (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06), with only one serious adverse effect found, which was Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the isotretinoin group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.98). However, we are uncertain about these results as they were based on very low-quality evidence. Isotretinoin may slightly improve (by 15%) acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.32; 351 participants; 2 studies), but resulted in more less serious adverse effects (67% higher risk) (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.98; 351 participants; 2 studies), such as dry lips/skin, cheilitis, vomiting, nausea (both outcomes, low-quality evidence). Different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoinFor our primary efficacy outcome, we found three RCTs, but heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. One study (154 participants) reported 79%, 80% and 84% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count after 20 weeks of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg/d of oral isotretinoin for severe acne (low-quality evidence). Another trial (150 participants, severe acne) compared 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/d oral isotretinoin for 20 weeks and, respectively, 58%, 80% and 90% of participants achieved 95% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count. One RCT, of participants with moderate acne, compared isotretinoin for 24 weeks at (a) continuous low dose (0.25 to 0.4 mg/kg/day), (b) continuous conventional dose (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day), and (c) intermittent regimen (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day, for one week in a month). Continuous low dose (MD 3.72 lesions; 95% CI 2.13 to 5.31; 40 participants; one study) and conventional dose (MD 3.87 lesions; 95% CI 2.31 to 5.43; 40 participants; one study) had a greater decrease in inflammatory lesion counts compared to intermittent treatment (all outcomes, low-quality evidence). Fourteen RCTs (906 participants, severe and moderate acne) reported that no serious adverse events were observed when comparing different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoin during treatment (from 12 to 32 weeks) or follow-up after end of treatment (up to 48 weeks). Thirteen RCTs (858 participants) analysed frequency of less serious adverse effects, which included skin dryness, hair loss, and itching, but heterogeneity regarding the assessment of the outcome precluded data pooling; hence, there is uncertainty about the results (low- to very-low quality evidence, where assessed). Improvement in acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation, was not measured for this comparison. None of the included RCTs reported birth defects.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence was low-quality for most assessed outcomes. We are unsure if isotretinoin improves acne severity compared with standard oral antibiotic and topical treatment when assessed by a decrease in total inflammatory lesion count, but it may slightly improve physician-assessed acne severity. Only one serious adverse event was reported in the isotretinoin group, which means we are uncertain of the risk of serious adverse effects; however, isotretinoin may result in more minor adverse effects. Heterogeneity in the studies comparing different regimens, doses, or formulations of oral isotretinoin meant we were unable to undertake meta-analysis. Daily treatment may be more effective than treatment for one week each month. None of the studies in this comparison reported serious adverse effects, or measured improvement in acne severity assessed by physician's global evaluation. We are uncertain if there is a difference in number of minor adverse effects, such as skin dryness, between doses/regimens. Evidence quality was lessened due to imprecision and attrition bias. Further studies should ensure clearly reported long- and short-term standardised assessment of improvement in total inflammatory lesion counts, participant-reported outcomes, and full safety accounts. Oral isotretinoin for acne that has not responded to oral antibiotics plus topical agents needs further assessment, as well as different dose/regimens of oral isotretinoin in acne of all severities.

### Duration of oral tetracycline-class antibiotic therapy and use of topical retinoids for the treatment of acne among general practitioners (GP): a retrospective cohort study [^112knEYS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend limiting the duration of oral antibiotic therapy in acne to 3 to 6 months and prescribing concomitant topical retinoids for all patients.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the duration of therapy with oral tetracyclines and the use of topical retinoids among patients with acne treated primarily by general practitioners in the United Kingdom.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Health Improvement Network database.

Results

The mean duration of therapy was 175.1 days. Of antibiotic courses, 62% were not associated with a topical retinoid; 29% exceeded 6 months in duration. If all regions were to achieve uses similar to the region with the shortest mean duration of therapy, approximately 3.3 million antibiotic days per year could be avoided in the United Kingdom.

Limitations

The Health Improvement Network does not include information on acne severity and clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Prescribing behavior for oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne among general practitioners is not aligned with current guideline recommendations. Increasing the use of topical retinoids and considering alternative agents to oral antibiotics when appropriate represent opportunities to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated complications such as antibiotic resistance and to improve outcomes in patients treated for acne.

### Oral cephalexin for acne vulgaris: clinical experience with 93 patients [^114FDQVE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

For patients who fail traditional acne therapy or experience side effects, other treatments are needed. Cephalexin has been noted to be efficacious in some instances. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of cephalexin for acne. A retrospective chart review of 93 acne patients treated with cephalexin was performed. Data collection included patient demographics, other acne therapies, clinical response, and side effects. Of the 98 courses of cephalexin, 4% of patients cleared, 45% were much improved, 29% were somewhat improved, 16% experienced no change, and 6% worsened at first follow-up visit. The median treatment length was 6 months. Eighty-four percent of patients had previously used a systemic antibiotic(s) for acne. Seven percent experienced adverse effects. This is a small retrospective analysis without a comparison group and is limited by the number of patients and nonstandardized treatment lengths and charting procedures. Cephalexin is a promising alternative treatment for acne, with 78% of patients exhibiting at least some clinical improvement.

### Evolving perspectives on the etiology and pathogenesis of acne vulgaris [^1139Kvar]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

As the pathophysiology of acne is complex and multifactorial, the continued influx of new basic science and clinical information requires careful analysis before drawing conclusions about what truly contributes to the development and progression of this chronic disease. Our objective is to review the latest evidence and highlight a number of important perspectives on the pathophysiology of acne. An improved understanding of acne pathogenesis should lead to more rational therapy and a better understanding of the role of P acnes opens new perspectives for the development of new treatments and management. Further research may be directed at targeting receptors, adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines or other pro-inflammatory targets implicated in the activation of immune detection and response (i.e., toll-like receptors [TLRs], protease-activated receptors [PARs]) that appear to contribute to the pathophysiology of acne. Therapeutic options that reduce the need for topical and/or oral antibiotic therapy for acne are welcome as bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a clinically relevant concern both in the United States and globally.

### Network analysis finds oral isotretinoin most effective for… [^1119YvHd]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the most effective therapies for acne vulgaris. Bottom Line Oral isotretinoin was the most effective therapy for decreasing the number of lesions in patients with acne. However, oral isotretinoin is not considered first-line therapy. Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide combined with oral or topical antibiotics were comparably effective in achieving the assessment of treatment success. Another analysis suggested starting treatment with adapalene plus benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin plus benzoyl peroxide, or adapalene alone. They included 210 papers with 65, 601 patients. The median duration of the studies was 12 weeks. The studies evaluated six oral antibiotics, five topical antibiotics, oral isotretinoin, five topical retinoids, six combined oral contraceptives, topical clascoterone, 10 combination therapies, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and placebo.

The most common outcomes were disease-oriented inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, but 69 studies reported the investigators' global assessment of success. No study reported patients' self-assessments. Overall, the studies were of decent quality. Oral isotretinoin was the most effective agent at decreasing the number of lesions, followed by combination therapy. For patients with inflammatory lesions, oral isotretinoin was also the most effective, followed by a combination of topical antibiotics plus azelaic acid. The effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives was inconsistent, possibly due to studies that included patients without hormonally sensitive acne.

Using the investigators' assessment of treatment success, topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide combined with oral or topical antibiotics were comparable. Patients taking topical trifarotene had the greatest odds of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. There were moderate to high degrees of heterogeneity among the data. There was no strong evidence of publication bias.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^115DvHbg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we found a range of views about topical treatments and oral antibiotics that could lead to early termination of treatment and progression to alternative treatments for acne. It is important for patients to be told that acne can be a chronic condition which requires either long‐term and/or maintenance therapy to reduce the potential for relapse. Our findings highlight the importance of health professionals directing patients towards high‐quality evidence‐based information about acne, particularly to help them understand treatment options, emphasize the delayed onset of action of many acne treatments and how to mitigate against side‐effects. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways in which support can be provided for young people with acne to help them manage the condition.

### A retrospective analysis of the duration of oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acne among adolescents: investigating practice gaps and potential cost-savings [^112PhMcG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Duration of oral antibiotic therapy in acne has not been widely studied. Recent guidelines suggest it should be limited to 3 to 6 months.

Objective

We sought to compare the duration of oral antibiotic use with recent guidelines and determine the potential cost-savings related to shortened durations.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database. Claims data were used to determine duration and costs of antibiotic therapy.

Results

The mean course duration was 129 days. The majority (93%) of courses were less than 9 months. Among the 31,634 courses, 18,280 (57.8%) did not include concomitant topical retinoid therapy. The mean (95% confidence interval) duration with and without topical retinoid use was 133 (131.5–134.7) days and 127 (125.4–127.9) days, respectively. The mean excess direct cost of antibiotic treatment for longer than 6 months was $580.99/person.

Limitations

Claims cannot be attributed to a specific diagnosis or provider. The database does not provide information on acne severity.

Conclusions

Duration of antibiotic use is decreasing when compared with previous data. However, 5547 (17.53%) courses exceeded 6 months, highlighting an opportunity for reduced antibiotic use. If courses greater than 6 months were shortened to 6 months, savings would be $580.99/person.

### Antibiotic resistance: shifting the paradigm in topical acne treatment [^117XuaDy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multiple topical therapies are available for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. The role of antibiotics and their resistance in the treatment of acne was reviewed by an expert panel of dermatologists who practice in Canada.

Methods

Prior to the consensus meeting, the panel members filled out a survey on their current practice using topical treatment for acne. A literature review was carried out using information obtained from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, and EMBASE. During a consensus meeting organized at the Spring Dermatology Update on April 27, 2014 in Toronto, ON, the panel had a blind vote on the issues at hand.

Results

The panel reached consensus on: 1) Antibiotics are an integral part of acne treatment not only due to their antibiotic effect but also by their anti-inflammatory action. 2) Oral antibiotics should be used for a short period of time if possible. 3) Topical antibiotics should not be used in monotherapy. 4) Retinoids are effective in reducing antibiotic resistance. 5) A benzoyl peroxide wash is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide in reducing antibiotic resistance. 6) Therapy needs to be re-evaluated in 6–8 weeks versus 12 weeks. The recommendations given by the panel are to be disseminated to both general practitioners and dermatologists.

Conclusion

For mild to moderate acne treatment, topical antibiotics in monotherapy are not to be used but may be combined with a retinoid or BPO to safely achieve more successful outcomes.

### Treatment of acne in pregnancy [^113iodRZ]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common disease of the pilosebaceous unit and affects adolescents and adults. Because high-quality guidelines regarding treatment of acne in pregnancy are scarce, management of this condition can be challenging. We describe the safety profile of common therapies and outline approaches based on available evidence. Topical azelaic acid or benzoyl peroxide can be recommended as baseline therapy. A combination of topical erythromycin or clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide is recommended for inflammatory acne. Oral erythromycin or cephalexin is generally considered safe for moderate to severe inflammatory acne when used for a few weeks. A short course of oral prednisolone may be useful for treating fulminant nodular cystic acne after the first trimester. In general, topical and oral antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy, but combined with topical benzoyl peroxide to decrease bacterial resistance. Oral retinoids are teratogenic and absolutely contraindicated for women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy. Although some complementary therapies including micronutrients and nonpharmacologic treatments seem to be well tolerated, limited data exist regarding their safety and efficacy, and they are not currently recommended during pregnancy. The risk-to-benefit ratio, efficacy, acceptability, and costs are considerations when choosing a treatment for acne in pregnancy.

### The use of oral antibiotics in treating acne vulgaris: a new approach [^111z8VWp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Although acne is not an infectious disease, oral antibiotics have remained a mainstay of treatment over the last 40 years. The anti-inflammatory properties of oral antibiotics, particularly the tetracyclines, are efficacious in treating inflammatory acne lesions. Common prescribing practices in Dermatology exert significant selection pressure on bacteria, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic use for acne not only promotes resistance in Propionibacterium acnes, but also affects other host bacteria with pathogenic potential. This review will summarize the commonly used treatments for acne vulgaris, and how they should be combined as rational treatment. The indications for using oral antibiotics in acne will be highlighted. Strategies described in the literature to conserve the utility of oral antibiotics will be summarized. These include limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy, concomitant use of a topical non-antibiotic agent, use of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, and the introduction of topical dapsone.

### Intravenous versus oral antibiotics for eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (TORPEDO-CF): a randomised controlled trial [^112ZFQak]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Chronic pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. If antibiotics are commenced promptly, infection can be eradicated. The aim of the trial was to compare the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin versus oral ciprofloxacin in the eradication of P aeruginosa.

Methods

We did a multicentre, parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 72 cystic fibrosis centres (70 in the UK and two in Italy). Eligible participants were older than 28 days with an isolate of P aeruginosa (either the first ever isolate or a new isolate after at least 1 year free of infection). Participants were excluded if the P aeruginosa was resistant to, or they had a contraindication to, one or more of the trial antibiotics; if they were already receiving P aeruginosa suppressive therapy; if they had received any P aeruginosa eradication therapy within the previous 9 months; or if they were pregnant or breastfeeding. We used web-based randomisation to assign patients to 14 days intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin or 12 weeks oral ciprofloxacin. Both were combined with 12 weeks inhaled colistimethate sodium. Randomisation lists were generated by a statistician, who had no involvement in the trial, using a computer-generated list. Randomisation was stratified by centre and because of the nature of the interventions, blinding was not possible. Our primary outcome was eradication of P aeruginosa at 3 months and remaining free of infection to 15 months. Primary analysis used intention to treat (powered for superiority). Safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study drug. TORPEDO-CF was registered on the ISRCTN register, ISRCTN02734162, and EudraCT, 2009–012575–10.

Findings

Between Oct 5, 2010, and Jan 27, 2017, 286 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 137 to intravenous antibiotics and 149 to oral antibiotics. 55 (44%) of 125 participants in the intravenous group and 68 (52%) of 130 participants in the oral group achieved the primary outcome. Participants randomly assigned to the intravenous group were less likely to achieve the primary outcome, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant (relative risk 0.84, 95% CI 0.65–1.09; p = 0.18). 11 serious adverse events occurred in ten (8%) of 126 participants in the intravenous antibiotics group and 17 serious adverse events in 12 (8%) of 146 participants in the oral antibiotics group.

Interpretation

Compared with oral therapy, intravenous antibiotics did not achieve sustained eradication of P aeruginosa in a greater proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis and was more expensive. Although there were fewer hospitalisations in the intravenous group than the oral group during follow-up, this confers no advantage over oral treatment because intravenous eradication frequently requires hospitalisation. These results do not support the use of intravenous antibiotics to eradicate P aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis.

### Long-pulsed dye laser-mediated photodynamic therapy combined with topical therapy for mild to severe comedonal, inflammatory, or cystic acne [^116uwgVU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acne patients who fail to respond to conventional treatments have been treated with isotretinoin, an effective treatment coming under strict regulation due to the risk of significant side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be a viable alternative treatment for recalcitrant acne of various types and levels of severity.

Objective

To determine the safety and efficacy of combination PDT with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and activation by long-pulsed, pulsed dye laser (LP PDL, 595 nm) energy with topical therapy in patients with mild to severe acne.

Methods

A prospective, controlled pilot, proof-of-principle study of 19 consecutive patients (aged 16–47 years, Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI) with mild to severe cystic, inflammatory, or comedonal acne of the face was conducted. All patients had failed conventional therapy, including oral antibiotics, topical treatments, hormonal therapy, laser procedures (without ALA), and/or oral isotretinoin. Fifteen patients were treated with ALA PDT and 4 patients served as controls; all were continued on topical medications. Patients undergoing PDT were initially randomized to receive either blue light or laser energy. Because recrudescence occurred in 1 patient while undergoing multiple treatments with ALA and blue light, all subsequent patients were treated with ALA and laser energy. The total number of patients treated with LP PDL-mediated ALA PDT was 14. ALA was applied for a short 45-minute incubation followed by 1 minimally overlapping pass with the LP PDL (595 nm, 7.0–7.5 J/cm2 fluence, 10-ms pulse duration, 10-mm spot size, and dynamic cooling spray of 30 ms with a 30-ms delay). Patients treated with conventional therapy (oral antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and topical medications) or laser energy without ALA PDT served as control groups. Patients were followed monthly for up to 13 months.

Results

Complete clearance was achieved in 100% (14 out of 14) patients in the LP PDL PDT-treated group. A mean of 2.9 treatments (range 1–6; 2.0–3.7, 95% CI; n = 14) was required to achieve complete clearance for a mean follow-up time of 6.4 months (range 1–13; 3.8–8.9 95% CI; n = 14). The patient mean percent lesional clearance rate per treatment was 77% (64%-90%, 95% CI; n = 14). Improvement in acne lesions became apparent within 1 to 2 weeks after the first treatment. Clearance in the LP PDL PDT group was superior to control groups. In the LP PDL-only control group (n = 2), the patient mean percent lesional clearance rate per treatment was 32% without complete clearance after 3 to 4 treatments. In the oral antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and topicals control group (n = 2), the clearance rate per treatment was 20%, the mean clearance rate per month was 4%, and complete clearance was not achieved after 6 to 10 months. In the LP PDL-mediated PDT group, treatments were well-tolerated with minimal erythema lasting 1 to 2 days. No cases of crusting, blistering, purpura, scarring, or dyspigmentation occurred. A reduction in the erythema in erythematous acne scars was observed.

Conclusion

For teenage to adult patients with recalcitrant comedonal, inflammatory, or cystic acne of various degrees of severity, ALA PDT with activation by LP PDL appears to be a safe and effective treatment with minimal side effects. LP PDL-mediated PDT may serve as an important alternative to isotretinoin. Cosmetically well-accepted, LP PDL PDT combined with topical therapy is the first PDT modality to achieve complete clearance with long-term follow-up as compared to controls.

### Common and alternate oral antibiotic therapies for acne vulgaris: a review [^114wfhAk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common disorder affecting many adolescents and adults throughout their lifetimes. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and is thought to involve excess sebum, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial colonization, and inflammation. Many therapeutic options exist for treating acne, including topical benzoyl peroxide, topical and oral antibiotics, topical and oral retinoids, and oral contraceptives. Oral antibiotics have been a mainstay in the treatment of acne for decades and function by exerting an antibacterial effect by reducing the follicular colonization of Propionibacterium acnes. Systemic antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This article reviews the English language literature on the efficacy of various systemic antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris, including second-line and less historically used medications. We discuss the tetracyclines, including subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, macrolides (notably azithromycin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as treatment options for acne vulgaris.

### Combination therapy for acne scarring: personal experience and clinical suggestions [^112d768u]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acne is one of the most prevalent skin conditions seen by dermatologists. The cosmetic sequelae of severe acne, including scarring and pigmentation, have a profound psychological impact on those in icted. Topical (eg, retinoids, antibiotics, dapsone, hydroxyacids) and oral treatments (eg, antibiotics and/or spironolactone) are often bene cial to control acne or in the instance of oral isotretinoin use, rid the acne permanently; however, these treatments have very little affect on the ultimate cosmetic outcome of the acne scarring and skin texture that results. Given the variety of scar types that can form and the variability of responses seen in various skin types and textures, treatment options are vast without appropriate guidelines for pathways that dictate best timing, combinations, and options in given clinical scenarios. Current treatment options include solo or combina- tions of energy-based (eg, laser, radiofrequency), chemical-based (eg, peels, TCA cross), surgical-based options (eg, subcision, punch excision), microneedling, and llers and/or fat injections. Most recently, fractional radiofrequency-based treatments have been used to improve acne scarring with less reported downtime as compared to lasers or chemical peels and the ability to treat darker or sensitive skin types with less risk of scarring or hyperpigmentation. In severe cystic ares, scarring treatments are often postposed till the acne is under control and in many instances this can limit the dermatologists ability to affect future cosmetic treatments. Based on personal experience of various clinical scenarios in a busy laser practice that treats a signi cant number of patients with acne scarring, fractional radiofrequency is an excellent choice for treating all forms of acne scars with minimal risk to patients, even those on concurrent treatments such as isotretinoin. Additionally, fractional radiofrequency can be used in combination with all other treatment options to speed the time to clinical improvement appreciated by the patient. Here we present personal experiences of combination treatments for acne scarring, pigmentation and textural issues, and suggest that fractional radiofrequency be considered a "gold standard" treatment of acne scarring in those with dark or sensitive skin types or those on concurrent isotretinoin. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(11):1413–1419. </em>.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### Acne vulgaris [^112hQdzT]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris affects over 80% of teenagers, and persists beyond the age of 25 years in 3% of men and 12% of women. Typical lesions of acne include comedones, inflammatory papules, and pustules. Nodules and cysts occur in more severe acne and can cause scarring and psychological distress.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical and oral treatments in people with acne vulgaris? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 69 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: topical treatments (adapalene, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin [alone or plus zinc]; isotretinoin, tetracycline, tretinoin); and oral treatments (doxycycline, isotretinoin, lymecycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline).

### The use of hormonal antiandrogen therapy in female patients with acne: a 10-year retrospective study [^111LtqX9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about how dermatologists prescribe hormonal antiandrogen acne treatment (HAAT).

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate dermatologists' HAAT-prescribing habits and HAAT's impact on systemic antibiotic use in women with acne.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study at an academic medical center of female patients receiving HAAT (combined oral contraceptive [COC], spironolactone) for acne from January 2005 to October 2015. Data from a control group of female acne patients who never received HAAT were also collected.

Results

A total of 672 female patients received HAAT. Out of all systemic medications for acne, antibiotics were used as first-line treatment in 39% of patients, COCs in 12%, and spironolactone in 21%. Mean antibiotic durations in patients who initiated HAAT for the first time at the study site (250.4 days) were significantly longer than in patients who received HAAT prior to presentation and continued HAAT at the study site (192.0 days) (p = 0.021). A statistically significant inverse association was found between HAAT use and mean antibiotic duration (p = 0.016).

Conclusions

HAAT is not typically used as a first-line systemic therapy in women with acne. HAAT usage is associated with shorter cumulative antibiotic durations and early HAAT initiation can decrease systemic antibiotic use in acne treatment.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^11428PMQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Research and knowledge gaps in acne — priority areas span populations, mechanisms, assessment, therapies, devices, and diet. Identified needs include treatment of acne in persons of color and in pregnant women; mechanistic work on molecular and cellular drivers, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, acne scar pathophysiology, and immunopathogenesis; clinical tools to better characterize acne in the office and validated patient‑reported outcomes; topical therapy data including efficacy, safety, and side effects in children 8–12 years of age plus compliance and allergy quantification; comparative studies on duration of oral antibiotics; hormonal questions including duration of therapy, large prospective studies of spironolactone for postadolescent women, comparative effectiveness trials of COCs, and standardized PCOS workup; isotretinoin long‑term safety (causal links to depression and inflammatory bowel disease), prevention of isotretinoin‑exposed pregnancies, and optimal total cumulative dosing; rigorous randomized and comparative‑effectiveness trials for acne chemical peels and for light and laser devices including sources/wavelengths and lesion types; and long‑term diet trials of low‑glycemic index diet, milk (skim vs whole), and prospective studies of fish oil, probiotics, oral zinc, and topical tea tree oil.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^116Z9EP4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

### Oral antibacterial therapy for acne vulgaris: an evidence-based review [^115Vfmg9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To some degree, acne vulgaris affects nearly every individual worldwide. Oral antibiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne; however, long-term use of oral antibiotics for acne may have unintended consequences.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the efficacy and appropriate use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Overall, 41 articles that examined oral antibiotics compared with placebo, another oral therapy, topical therapy, alternate dose, or duration were included in this study.

Results

Tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Superior efficacy of one type or class of antibiotic could not be determined, therefore the choice of antibiotic is generally based on the side-effect profile. Although different dosing regimens have been studied, there is a lack of standardized comparator trials to determine optimal dosing and duration of each oral antibiotic used in acne. The combination of oral antibiotics with a topical therapy is superior to oral antibiotics alone.

Conclusion

This article provides a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence of the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Due to heterogeneity in the design of the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support one type, dose, or duration of oral antibiotic over another in terms of efficacy; however, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, dermatologists should heed consensus guidelines for their appropriate use.

### Trends in oral antibiotic use for acne treatment: a retrospective, population-based study in the United States, 2014 to 2016 [^112Gm3BM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance related to prolonged antibiotic use is an emerging threat to public health.

Objective

To evaluate recent trends in oral antibiotic use for acne treatment.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted from January 2014 through September 2016 using the IBM MarketScan&reg; claims database. Patients were aged &ge;9 years, prescribed an oral antibiotic, and diagnosed with acne vulgaris on 2 separate occasions. The primary outcome was the duration of oral antibiotic treatment over 12 months; continuous use was defined as &le;30-day gap between prescriptions.

Results

The most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments (N = 46,267) were doxycycline (36.7%) and minocycline (36.5%). Overall, 36%, 18%, 10%, and 5% of patients continuously used any oral antibiotic at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. Among patients who continuously used tetracyclines, a similar percentage was prescribed minocycline (40.2%, 18.6%, 10.5%, and 5.1%) vs doxycycline (34.7%, 14.6%, 7.7%, and 3.9%) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. A greater percentage of patients continued use of tetracyclineclass antibiotics than other therapeutic classes.

Limitations

Retrospective analysis of health-care claims data. Relatively short study duration.

Conclusion

Nearly 20% of patients continuously used oral antibiotics for &ge;6 months, exceeding American Academy of Dermatology guideline recommendations of 3 to 4 months. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(3):265–270. doi:10.36849/JDD.7345.

### Approaches to limit systemic antibiotic use in acne: systemic alternatives, emerging topical therapies, dietary modification, and laser and light-based treatments [^111Y1gKc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acne is one of the most common diseases worldwide and affects ∼50 million individuals in the United States. Oral antibiotics are the most common systemic agent prescribed for the treatment of acne. However, their use might be associated with a variety of adverse outcomes including bacterial resistance and disruption of the microbiome. As a result, multiple treatment guidelines call for limiting the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne, although actual prescribing often does not follow these guidelines. In this review, the rationale for concerns regarding the use of oral antibiotics for the management of acne is reviewed. In addition, we will discuss our approach to complying with the intent of the guidelines, with a focus on novel topical agents, dietary modification, laser and light-based modalities, and systemic medications, such as spironolactone, combined oral contraceptives, and oral isotretinoin.

### Therapeutic considerations for severe nodular acne [^1136T1wS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Severe nodular acne, defined as grade 4 or 5 acne on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment scale, is a skin condition characterized by intense erythema, inflammation, nodules, cysts, and scarring. Both the well known risk of physical scarring and the more recent recognition that acne can be a chronic, psychologically distressing disease with significant adverse effects on a patient's quality of life, have prompted earlier, more aggressive treatment with more effective medications, in the hope of preventing progression to more severe, nodular forms of the disease. Oral antibacterials, primarily tetracyclines, have long been the first-line therapy for severe nodular acne, which frequently remained refractory to therapy. However, concerns of antibacterial adverse effects, patient adherence, and antimicrobial resistance prompted the search for alternate therapies and combinations thereof in order to target the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease. Isotretinoin, an oral retinoid introduced in 1982, has since become the gold standard therapy in severe acne and has revolutionized its treatment. Several adjunctive agents exist. Oral antibacterials are indicated as an alternative for patients with severe acne who cannot tolerate oral retinoids, or for whom a contraindication exists. In order to prevent bacterial resistance, antibacterials should always be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, a nonantibiotic antimicrobial agent with anti-inflammatory activity. Topical retinoids are often added to this regimen. In women, hormonal agents, which include oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and oral corticosteroids, and, in Europe, cyproterone acetate, may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with isotretinoin. For rapid treatment of inflammatory nodules, intralesional corticosteroids are effective. These treatment modalities have been studied, refined, and combined in novel ways in order to target the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease, and in this article we review each of their roles.

### Successful combined antibiotic therapy with oral clindamycin and oral rifampicin for pyoderma gangrenosum in patient with PASH syndrome [^113EthYU]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatitis, the prevalence of which is unknown. The only reported incidence in the literature estimates that there are 3 to 10 cases per million annually in the United Kingdom. The association with digestive tract and inflammatory rheumatic disease, neoplasia, and endocrinopathies is well known.

New autoinflammatory syndromes with PG have been described: PAPA syndrome, combining PG with pyogenic sterile arthritis and cystic acne; PASH syndrome, combining PG with cystic acne and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS); and PAPASH syndrome, combining PG with pyogenic sterile arthritis, acne, and HS.

PAPA and PAPASH syndromes arise from mutations in the coding region of the proline-serine-threonine-phosphatase interacting protein 1 gene (PSTPIP1) resulting in the loss of inhibitory effect on the NALP3 inflammasome with production of interleukin (IL)-1β. For PASH syndrome, the only known anomaly is an increase in the number of CCTG repetitions in the PSTPIP1 promoter, with no known functional impact.

First-line treatment for PG is generally based on systemic corticosteroid therapy or antibiotics with an anti-inflammatory action (eg, dapsone and tetracyclines) or immunosuppressive drugs (eg, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil). Also introduced recently are anti–tumor necrosis factor-α agents, anti–IL-1 (anakinra), and finally anti–IL-12–IL-23 (ustekinumab) and anti–IL-17 (ixekizumab).

Studies investigating PASH syndrome found that cyclosporine and dapsone and biotherapy using anti–tumor necrosis factor-αand anti–IL-1 (anakinra)are effective. The clinical course is, however, marked by the risk of repeated relapses and resistance to conventional treatments for PG. Furthermore, any proposed therapeutic strategy should be effective against all 3 entities (ie, PG, HS, and cystic acne).

### Comparison of efficacy of azithromycin vs. doxycycline in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^114uBh3Z]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory disorder of the skin. Oral antibiotics are known to be effective in its treatment. A randomized, investigator-blinded study was performed to compare the efficacy of azithromycin with doxycycline. Fifty-one patients were randomized to receive either azithromycin 500 mg/day on 3 consecutive days per week in the first, on 2 consecutive days per week in the second, and on 1 day per week in the third month. The other group was given doxycycline twice a day for the first month and once a day for the second and third months. Clinical assessment was made at baseline, at the end of first, second, third, and post-treatment first and second months. Side effects were recorded. Statistically significant improvement for the facial lesions were obtained with both drugs. Neither drug was shown to be more effective than the other. The beneficial effect continued until 2 months after treatment. In the azithromycin group three patients had diarrohea, while photosensitivity was seen in two patients using doxycycline. This study indicates that azithromycin is at least as effective as doxycycline in the treatment of acne.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^11722LS1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### A practical approach for the use of oral isotretinoin for infantile acne [^113hFSAm]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Infantile acne is a rare occurrence. It is more common in boys and predominately occurs on the cheeks in infants between the ages of 1 and 16 months. Clinically, the lesions range from comedones to inflammatory papulopustules to cysts. Successful therapies include topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide and topical and oral erythromycin. For more serious cases, oral isotretinoin (Accutane) has been reported to successfully treat recalcitrant infantile cystic acne. We describe two additional patients with infantile cystic acne treated successfully with oral isotretinoin. The dose of isotretinoin used ranged from 0.2 mg/kg/day to 1.5 mg/kg/day. The treatment duration varied from 5 to 14 months. Careful monthly monitoring is recommended because of the many side effects reported with isotretinoin. Practical tips for the administration of oral isotretinoin in infants are reviewed.

### Oral tetracyclines and acne: a systematic review for dermatologists [^116HucH6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Oral tetracyclines are the most widely prescribed systemic antibiotic for acne. Synthesis of efficacy and safety of traditional and novel oral tetracyclines is highly informative to clinical practice. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed to identify large interventional and observational studies utilizing oral tetracyclines as an acne treatment. We identified 13 articles meeting inclusion for this review, which represented 226,019 pediatric and adult acne patients. Oral tetracyclines that were included in this systematic review were sarecycline (a novel narrow-spectrum tetracycline), doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline. Based on shared and divergent outcome measures, different oral tetracyclines were variably effective against facial acne. Sarecycline also demonstrated efficacy in truncal acne. Members of the oral tetracycline class also differed in their ability to minimize antibiotic resistance and gut dysbiosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19:11(Suppl):s4–11.

### Trends in the treatment of acne vulgaris: are measures being taken to avoid antimicrobial resistance? [^112zshH7]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris has been treated with long-term courses of antibiotics since the 1960s. Antibiotic-resistance of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) was first documented in the late 1970s, and, over 20 years later, the problem of antibiotic resistance still exists.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to assess trends in prescribing antibiotics for acne from 1997–2006.

Methods

The authors examined the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) database and recorded medications at all visits to the physician in which acne vulgaris (ICD-9-CM code 706.1) was the only diagnosis from 1997–2006.

Results

Declines in the use of erythromycin and isotretinoin (both P < 0.001) for acne were noted for all physicians. Tetracyclines saw significant increases in use by both dermatologists and non-dermatologists (P < 0.01 and P = 0.05, respectively). Prescribing of benzoyl peroxide monotherapy was unchanged for non-dermatologists (P = 0.22) and is on the decline for dermatologists (P < 0.001). The use of BPO + clindamycin combination topical treatments rose sharply for all physicians (P < 0.001), resulting in greater use of both total BPO and total clindamycin for acne over time (P < 0.001). Topical retinoid use increased among dermatologists (P < 0.05) but appeared to be on the decline among non-dermatologists (P = 0.067).

Conclusion

The development of antibiotic resistance is of concern. Greater awareness of retinoid use for maintenance therapy, using topical benzoyl peroxide to prevent resistance, and limiting use of oral antibiotics to as short a time period as possible are measures to contribute to better eco-responsible acne treatment.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116xjWk8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne systemic antibiotic stewardship — Monotherapy with oral antibiotics is strongly discouraged, and the use of topical maintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized. Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemic antibiotics, and the work group's consensus suggests that such maintenance is paramount to reducing antibiotic resistance. Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing recommendations, such as pulse dosing and submicrobial dosing, but no alternative dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatory bowel disease, pharyngitis, C difficile infection, and the induction of Candida vulvovaginitis. While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group's consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics even while taking topical medications.

### Long-term oral antibiotic use in people with acne vulgaris in UK primary care: a drug utilization study [^114FjnyP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The inappropriate use of antibiotics is understood to contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Oral antibiotics are regularly used to treat moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. In practice, we do not know the typical length of oral antibiotic treatment courses for acne in routine primary care and what proportion of people receive more than one course of treatment following a new acne diagnosis.

Objectives

To describe how oral antibiotics are prescribed for acne over time in UK primary care.

Methods

We conducted a descriptive longitudinal drug utilization study using routinely collected primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (2004–2019). We included individuals (8–50years) with a new acne diagnosis recorded between 1 January 2004 and 31 July 2019.

Results

We identified 217 410 people with a new acne diagnosis. The median age was 17years [interquartile range (IQR) 15–25] and median follow-up was 4.3years (IQR 1.9–7.6). Among people with a new acne diagnosis, 96 703 (44.5%) received 248 560 prescriptions for long-term oral antibiotics during a median follow-up of 5.3years (IQR 2.8–8.5). The median number of continuous courses of antibiotic therapy (≥ 28days) per person was four (IQR 2–6). The majority (n = 59 010, 61.0%) of first oral antibiotic prescriptions in those with a recorded acne diagnosis were between the ages of 12 and 18. Most (n = 71 544, 74.0%) first courses for oral antibiotics were for between 28 and 90days. The median duration of the first course of treatment was 56days (IQR 50–93days) and 18 127 (18.7%) of prescriptions of ≥ 28days were for < 6 weeks. Among people who received a first course of oral antibiotic for ≥ 28days, 56 261 (58.2%) received a second course after a treatment gap of ≥ 28days. The median time between first and second courses was 135days (IQR 67–302). The cumulative duration of exposure to oral antibiotics during follow-up was 255days (8.5months).

Conclusions

Further work is needed to understand the consequences of using antibiotics for shorter periods than recommended. Suboptimal treatment duration may result in reduced clinical effectiveness or repeated exposures, potentially contributing to antimicrobial resistance.

### Acne vulgaris: treatment guidelines from the AAD… [^115TrYKP]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin.

First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin. Because of the risk of developing bacterial resistance when erythromycin and clindamycin are used as monotherapy, if prescribed, they should be combined with benzoyl peroxide. A topical retinoid alone is recommended primarily for comedonal acne, and for persons with mixed or inflammatory acne, it also can be used in conjunction with a topical or oral antimicrobial. SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS Moderate to severe acne, as well as inflammatory acne in which topical medications have been ineffective, can be treated with systemic antibiotics.

Data are limited regarding the use of antibiotics that are not tetracyclines or macrolides; therefore, their use should be avoided. Doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. Antibiotics should be prescribed for the briefest possible time frame, and their use should be assessed after three to four months to reduce the risk of developing a resistance. As with topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics should not be used alone. To maintain results after antibiotic treatment has concluded, benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used. Severe adverse effects of systemic antibiotics in persons treated for acne are uncommon.

### Therapeutic update: acne [^112MYvUh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a multi-factorial disease affecting a significant proportion of the population. A patient-centered approach is most effective for the treatment of acne, focusing both on life style interventions as well as pharmacologic therapy. Lifestyle modifications include dietary counseling, as a link between dietary choices and acne continues to grow. Pharmacologic regimens must account for the severity of disease, emergence of resistant bacterial strains and ease of patient compliance. Combination topical therapy is often required for patients with mixed inflammatory and comedonal acne, while oral medications are frequently needed for severe cases or those involving large surface areas such as the chest or back. With or without a photosensitizer, light based treatments present an alternative or adjuvant to traditional pharmacologic therapy. Novel formulations of existing medications in addition to original compounds continue in development, expanding therapeutic possibilities for the future. With the emergence of antibiotic resistance, we are forced to prescribe antibiotics more responsibly, while exploring alternatives to this longstanding standard of care. This article discusses current and emerging therapies for the treatment of acne.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris [^112LPiES]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Management of acne vulgaris by nondermatologists is increasing. Current understanding of the different presentations of acne allows for individualized treatments and improved outcomes.

Objective

To review the best evidence available for individualized treatment of acne.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database to search for all English-language articles on acne treatment from 1966 to 2004.

Study Selection

Well-designed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other systematic reviews are the focus of this article.

Data Extraction

Acne literature is characterized by a lack of standardization with respect to outcome measures and methods used to grade disease severity.

Data Synthesis

Main outcome measures of 29 randomized double-blind trials that were evaluated included reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total acne lesion counts. Topical retinoids reduce the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions in the range of 40% to 70%. These agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with comedones only. Other agents, including topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy (in women), and isotretinoin all yield high response rates. Patients with mild to moderate severity inflammatory acne with papules and pustules should be treated with topical antibiotics combined with retinoids. Oral antibiotics are first-line therapy in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne while oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne, treatment failures, scarring, frequent relapses, or in cases of severe psychological distress. Long-term topical or oral antibiotic therapy should be avoided when feasible to minimize occurrence of bacterial resistance. Isotretinoin is a powerful teratogen mandating strict precautions for use among women of childbearing age.

Conclusions

Acne responses to treatment vary considerably. Frequently more than 1 treatment modality is used concomitantly. Best results are seen when treatments are individualized on the basis of clinical presentation.

### Once-daily oral sarecycline 1.5 mg / kg / day is effective for moderate to severe acne vulgaris: results from two identically designed, phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trials [^1161o4zP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Side effects may limit the use of current tetracycline-class antibiotics for acne.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily sarecycline, a novel, narrow-spectrum tetracycline-class antibiotic, in moderate to severe acne.

Methods

Patients 9–45 years with moderate to severe facial acne (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score ≥ 3, 20–50 inflammatory and ≤ 100 noninflammatory lesions, and ≤ 2 nodules) were randomized 1:1 to sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg/day or placebo for 12 weeks in identically designed phase 3 studies (SC1401 and SC1402).

Results

In SC1401 (sarecycline n = 483, placebo n = 485) and SC1402 (sarecycline n = 519, placebo n = 515), at week 12, IGA success (≥ 2-grade improvement and score 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]) rates were 21.9% and 22.6% (sarecycline), respectively, versus 10.5% and 15.3% (placebo; P less than 0.0001 and P equals 0.0038). Onset of efficacy in inflammatory lesions occurred by the first visit (week 3), with mean percentage reduction in inflammatory lesions at week 12 in SC1401 and SC1402 of -51.8% and -49.9% (sarecycline), respectively, versus -35.1% and -35.4% (placebo; P less than 0.0001). Onset of efficacy for absolute reduction of noninflammatory lesion count occurred at week 6 in SC1401 (P less than 0.05) and week 9 in SC1402 (P less than 0.01). In SC1401, the most common TEAEs (in ≥ 2% of either sarecycline or placebo group) were nausea (4.6% [sarecycline]; 2.5% [placebo]), nasopharyngitis (3.1%; 1.7%), headache (2.7%; 2.7%), and vomiting (2.1%; 1.4%) and, in SC1402, nasopharyngitis (2.5%; 2.9%) and headache (2.9%; 4.9%). Most were not considered treatment-related. Vestibular (dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo) and phototoxic (sunburn, photosensitivity) TEAEs both occurred in ≤ 1% of sarecycline patients. Gastrointestinal TEAE rates for sarecycline were low. Among females, vulvovaginal candidiasis (SC1401: 1.1% [sarecycline] and 0 [placebo]; SC1402: 0.3% and 0) and mycotic infection (0.7% and 0; 1.0% and 0) rates were low.

Conclusion

The narrow-spectrum antibiotic sarecycline was safe, well tolerated, and effective for moderate to severe acne, with low rates of side effects common with tetracycline antibiotics. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(9):987–996.

### Is there a place for biologics in acne? [^111EQc2T]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Reports with Biologicals in Acne: Rethinking the Diagnosis

Despite the absence of clear evidence from systematic clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of biologicals in treating acne, a number of publications are known in the scientific literature offering contradictory findings. Case reports highlight the successful use of TNFα inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) and an IL-17 inhibitor (secukinumab) in severe, treatment-resistant cases of acne.

One case report described a 22-year-old man who presented with painful, inflamed nodular lesions, sinus tracts, pustules, and comedones on the face, neck, and trunk. The patient had failed conservative acne treatments, including topical agents, systemic antibiotics, and isotretinoin. Therefore, etanercept was initiated at a dosage of 25 mg twice weekly, leading to a complete regression of lesions within 24 weeks.

Another case report detailed a 22-year-old man with a 6-year history of severe nodular inflammatory acne involving the neck, chest, and posterior shoulders, notably without facial involvement, pustules, or comedones. The patient also had a history of ulcerative colitis. Previous treatments, including oral antibiotics (doxycycline), potent topical corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate 0.05%), intralesional corticosteroids, and isotretinoin (up to 80 mg daily), were ineffective. Infliximab was initiated at a dosage of 5 mg/kg administered intravenously every 8 weeks. Substantial improvement was observed after the first infusion, with no new lesions or reactivation of old lesions after three doses.

Shirakawa et al. reported a 64-year-old man with a three-month history of large, painful draining cysts. On examination, the patient also suffered from fluctuant nodules, pustules, and fibrotic scars on the anterior and posterior trunk, buttocks, and proximal areas of the arms and thighs. After 14 weeks of isotretinoin treatment (40 mg twice daily), the patient developed three draining lesions on the buttocks and trunk. Infliximab (3 mg/kg or 300 mg) dramatically reduced the size and number of cystic lesions, along with significant pain relief.

### Comparative efficacy of pharmacological treatments for acne vulgaris: a network meta-analysis of 221 randomized controlled trials [^111XYwS1]. Annals of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acne is an extremely common skin disease with an estimated global prevalence of 9.4%. We aim to provide comprehensive comparisons of the common pharmacological treatments for acne.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of pharmacological therapies for acne vulgaris in patients of any age and sex and with a treatment duration of > 2 weeks were included. PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception until February 2022. Our prespecified primary end points were mean percentage reduction in total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesions. Treatment ranking was determined by P values.

Results

There were 210 articles describing 221 trials and 37 interventions included in the analysis. Our primary analysis of percentage reduction in total lesion count had 65,601 patients enrolled. Across all trials, the mean age was 20.4 years. The median duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The median total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesion counts were 72, 27, and 44, respectively. The most effective treatment was oral isotretinoin (mean difference [MD] = 48.41; P = 1.00), followed by triple therapy containing a topical antibiotic, a topical retinoid, and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) (MD = 38.15; p = 0.95) and by triple therapy containing an oral antibiotic, a topical retinoid, and BPO (MD = 34.83; p = 0.90). For monotherapies, oral or topical antibiotics or topical retinoids have comparable efficacy for inflammatory lesions, while oral or topical antibiotics have less effect on noninflammatory lesions.

Conclusion

The most effective treatment for acne is oral isotretinoin, followed by triple therapies containing a topical retinoid, BPO, and an antibiotic. We present detailed comparisons of each intervention to serve as a practical database.

### Treatment of acne with oral isotretinoin in patients with cystic fibrosis [^1158sWLa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Theoretical concerns about liver disease and vitamin A deficiency have limited the use of oral isotretinoin for troublesome acne in adolescents with cystic fibrosis.

Methods

Oral isotretinoin was administered to nine patients with cystic fibrosis who had troublesome acne unresponsive to antibiotics. All patients were followed for 1–4 years after cessation of treatment.

Results

Isotretinoin treatment cleared active acne lesions in all patients. It was well tolerated, and no patient had significant side effects. All nine patients were pleased or delighted with the improvement in their skin.

Conclusions

Adolescents with cystic fibrosis and acne can be treated with oral isotretinoin. Oral isotretinoin should be considered for adolescents with cystic fibrosis who have acne associated with scarring, acne not clearing with topical and antibiotic treatment, acne associated with depression or severe cystic acne.

### Oral antibiotics for acne [^116b7tvs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral antibiotics are integral for treating inflammatory acne based on what is understood about the pathogenesis as well as the role of Cutibacterium acnes. However, rising concerns of antibiotic resistance and the perception of "antibiotic phobia" create potential limitations on their integration in an acne treatment regimen. When prescribing oral antibiotics, dermatologists need to consider dosage, duration, and frequency, and to avoid their use as monotherapy. These considerations are important, along with the use of newer strategies and compounds, to reduce adverse-event profiles, antibiotic resistance, and to optimize outcomes. Aside from concomitant medications, allergies, and disease severity, costs and patient demographics can influence variability in prescribing plans. There are multiple published guidelines and consensus statements for the USA and Europe to promote safe antibiotic use by dermatologists. However, there is a lack of head-to-head studies and evidence for comparative superiority of any individual antibiotic, as well as any evidence to support the use of agents other than tetracyclines. Although oral antibiotics are one of the main options for moderate to severe acne, non-antibiotic therapy such as isotretinoin and hormonal therapies should be considered. As newer therapies and more outcomes data emerge, so will improved management of antibiotic therapy to foster patient safety.

### New antibiotic therapies for acne and rosacea [^1166DiZ7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Acne and rosacea compromise a substantial portion of the dermatology clinical practice. Over the past century, many treatment modalities have been introduced with antibiotics playing a major role. Today, both oral and topical antibiotics are used in the management of acne and rosacea, with several novel formulations and/or combination regimens recently introduced. The latest studies suggest anti-inflammatory actions to be the most likely mechanism of antibiotics in acne and rosacea, shifting the focus to subantimicrobial-dose oral antibiotics and/or topical antibiotic regimens as the preferred first-line agents. Here we will discuss the most recent oral and topical antibiotic therapies available for treatment of acne and rosacea, with special focus on efficacy data, indication, dosing, and mechanism of action.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for the acne in a patient with this condition?
A. Topical retinoid
B. Oral antibiotic
C. Isotretinoin
D. Topical antibiotic
E. Benzoyl peroxide

Answers:
A. Topical retinoid – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin, not topical, is found to be most effective at resolving acneiform lesions associated with Apert syndrome.
B. Oral antibiotic – Incorrect. Although tetracyclines inhibit the FGFR2b downstream expression and activity of metalloproteinases, this inhibition has not been sufficient in treating this gain-of-function FGF2 mutation.
C. Isotretinoin – Correct. The onset of acne in Apert syndrome, and often oily skin, occurs in early puberty. When androgen levels increase, they promote FGF synthesis, activate the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation, and cause the severe acneiform lesions in these patients. FGF2b signaling is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acne. Although most drugs target single regions of the FGF2b signaling cascade, oral retinoids disrupt multiple regulatory steps and signals in the FGFR2 pathway and therefore provide the most effective treatment for patients with the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation. However, depending on the acne severity, isotretinoin may not be required in all patients. A risk-benefit assessment should be made on an individual case basis because of the numerous known potential side effects of isotretinoin. Of concern, the disruption of FGFR2 signaling during embryonic development yields a teratogenicity risk in postpubertal females.
D. Topical antibiotic – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin therapy is the best therapy for these patients.
E. Benzoyl peroxide – Incorrect. Although benzoyl peroxide is effective in interrupting acne pathogenesis through the degradation of lysosomal receptors and downregulation of FGFR2b, it is not sufficient in Apert syndrome. The gain-of-function FGF2 mutation in Apert syndrome requires multiple levels of pathway inhibition for successful treatment.

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety [^116eRejQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Minocycline is an oral antibiotic used for acne vulgaris. Its use has lessened due to safety concerns (including potentially irreversible pigmentation), a relatively high cost, and no evidence of any greater benefit than other acne treatments. A modified-release version of minocycline is being promoted as having fewer side-effects.

Objectives

To assess new evidence on the effects of minocycline for acne vulgaris.

Search Methods

Searches were updated in the following databases to November 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator undertook searches exploring minocycline's adverse effects in EMBASE and MEDLINE in February 2012.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing minocycline, at any dose, to an active or a placebo control, in participants with inflammatory acne vulgaris. For adverse effects, we selected additional studies that reported the number of adverse effects and the number of participants treated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and participants' global assessments, adverse effects, and dropout rates. Two authors independently assessed the quality of each study. Effect sizes were calculated, and meta-analyses were undertaken where possible. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 12 new RCTs for this update, giving a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). These additional 12 RCTs have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline. The identified RCTs were generally small and poor quality. Meta-analysis was rarely possible because of the lack of data and different outcome measures and trial durations. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe acne vulgaris, there was no evidence that it is better than any of the other commonly-used acne treatments. One company-sponsored RCT found minocycline to be less effective than combination treatment with topical erythromycin and zinc. No trials have been conducted using minocycline in those participants whose acne is resistant to other therapies. Also, there is no evidence to guide what dose should be used. The adverse effects studies must be interpreted with caution. The evidence suggests that minocycline is associated with more severe adverse effects than doxycycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, is associated with lupus erythematosus, but the risk is small: 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. The risk of autoimmune reactions increases with duration of use. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the more expensive extended-release preparation is safer than standard minocycline preparations.

Authors' Conclusions

Minocycline is an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris, but there is still no evidence that it is superior to other commonly-used therapies. This review found no reliable evidence to justify the reinstatement of its first-line use, even though the price-differential is less than it was 10 years ago. Concerns remain about its safety compared to other tetracyclines.

### Antibacterial therapy for acne: a guide to selection and use of systemic agents [^112bnUkK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a very common disorder, affecting virtually every adolescent at some point in time. Systemic antibacterials have been used in the treatment of acne for many years, and there are several commonly used antibacterials which have established efficacy and safety records. In recent years, the issue of antibacterials resistance has become more prominent, especially with concerns that Propionibacterium acnes can transfer antibacterials resistance to other bacteria within the resident skin flora. Commonly used antibacterials include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin (and other macrolides) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole). The choice of antibacterial should take into account efficacy, cost-effectiveness, benefit-risk ratios, patient acceptability and the potential for the development of resistance. Poor clinical response can be the result of poor compliance, inadequate duration of therapy, development of gram-negative folliculitis, resistance of P. acnes to the antibacterial(s) administered, or a high sebum excretion rate. In order to help prevent the development of resistance a number of measures should be undertaken: antibacterials are prescribed for an average of 6 months; if retreatment is required, utilize the same antibacterial; generally, antibacterials should be given for at least 2 months before considering switching due to poor therapeutic response; concomitant use of oral and topical chemically-dissimilar antibacterials should be avoided (try benzoyl peroxide and/or retinoids instead) and systemic isotretinoin should be considered if several antibacterials have been tried without success.

Oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics in cystic fibrosis — prophylaxis and chronic infection evidence: the 2007 guidelines recommended against the prophylactic use of oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics in individuals with CF. In chronic S. aureus infection, a small cross-over trial (n = 17) of cephalexin for 2 years reduced exacerbations requiring antibiotics versus placebo (25 vs. 53%) and reported fewer hospital admissions (4 vs. 22%), but a prophylaxis trial using 80–100 mg/kg cephalexin in 209 young children (< 6 yr) showed no benefit in lung function (FEV1, FVC, FEF25–75%) or exacerbations and had a higher rate of P. aeruginosa acquisition. A Cochrane Review evaluating four studies with 303 participants concluded the clinical significance of decreased S. aureus is unclear given potential increased P. aeruginosa risk; accordingly, the committee again recommended against prophylactic oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics and judged the certainty of net benefit as low with insufficient evidence to recommend therapy for individuals chronically infected with S. aureus.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113ZdjTj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotic recommendations — Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other. Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children < 8 years of age), and erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance. Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3–4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy.

### Treatments for acne vulgaris based on severity… [^111HXBaj]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Topical antibiotics include clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid also have antimicrobial activity. Original studies show that clindamycin and erythromycin reduce lesions to a similar degree as retinoids. Products that combine antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide are more effective than either product alone. Antimicrobials also can be used in combination with retinoids, with combination products being more successful than a topical antibiotic alone. Because the onset of action is slow, patients must be treated for six to eight weeks with these agents to observe an effect. Topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide can cause skin irritation. While conventional antibiotics often create bacterial resistance, this has not been reported with benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid. Oral antibiotics used for the treatment of acne include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin.

Studies on oral antibiotics are few and in some instances are hampered by methodological flaws. However, these agents appear to work better than placebo. Gastrointestinal side effects and photosensitivity are associated with tetracycline and doxycycline; minocycline also causes adverse side effects, including vertigo. Perhaps of most concern is the problem of antibiotic resistance, which affects more than one half of bacterial strains in Europe. Combination therapy and avoidance of long-term therapy are recommended. Hormonal treatments include oral contraceptives and androgen-receptor blockers. One trial showed a 50 percent reduction of lesions in patients treated with oral contraceptives, compared with 30 percent in those given placebo. In Europe, newer progesterone-estrogen combinations have been shown to be effective. Androgen-receptor blockers include spironolactone and flutamide. These agents must be used in high doses to be effective in the treatment of acne.

All agents in this class also are effective when used in combination with an oral contraceptive. Isotretinoin is used for severe cases of acne. One randomized controlled trial showed that doses of 0. 5 and 1 mg per kg per day resulted in an 80 percent or greater reduction in lesions. A single course of four to six months can be effective. Lower efficacy and higher rate of recurrence have been observed in patients treated with lower doses. In conclusion, the authors emphasize that treatment of acne should take into account fluctuations in severity and should be adjusted according to tolerance and response. In many cases, combination therapy is warranted.

### Optimizing use of oral antibiotics in acne vulgaris [^111M41To]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Oral antibiotics are commonly used to treat acne vulgaris, primarily in patients presenting with moderate to severe facial or truncal disease severity. These agents are most appropriately used in combination with a topical regimen containing benzoyl peroxide and a topical retinoid. The most common oral antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris are the tetracycline derivatives, although macrolide agents such as erythromycin have also been used extensively. Over the past 4 decades, as the sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to several oral and topical antibiotics has decreased, the efficacy of oral tetracycline and erythromycin has markedly diminished, leading to increased use of doxycycline, minocycline, and other agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

### Meta-analysis comparing efficacy of antibiotics versus oral contraceptives in acne vulgaris [^112b6Ykv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Both antibiotics and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been found to be effective in managing acne vulgaris. Despite widespread use, few direct comparisons of efficacy between the 2 modalities have been published.

Objective

We compared the efficacy of antibiotics and OCPs in managing acne.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane collaboration guidelines.

Results

A review of 226 publications yielded 32 randomized controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. At 3 and 6 months, compared with placebo, both antibiotics and OCPs effected greater percent reduction in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total lesions; the 2 modalities at each time point demonstrated statistical parity, except that antibiotics were superior to OCPs in percent reduction of total lesions at 3 months (weighted mean inflammatory lesion reduction: 3-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 53.2%, 3-month course of OCPs = 35.6%, 3-month course of placebo treatment = 26.4%, 6-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 57.9%, 6-month course of OCPs = 61.9%, 6-month course of placebo treatment = 34.2%; weighted mean noninflammatory lesion reduction: 3-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 41.9%, 3-month course of OCPs = 32.6%, 3-month course of placebo treatment = 17.1%, 6-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 56.4%, 6-month course of OCPs = 49.1%, 6-month course of placebo treatment = 23.4%; weighted mean total lesion reduction: 3-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 48.0%, 3-month course of OCPs = 37.3%, 3-month course of placebo treatment = 24.5%, 6-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 52.8%, 6-month course of OCPs = 55.0%, 6-month course of placebo treatment = 28.6%).

Limitations

Investigative treatment heterogeneity and publication bias are limitations.

Conclusions

Although antibiotics may be superior at 3 months, OCPs are equivalent to antibiotics at 6 months in reducing acne lesions and, thus, may be a better first-line alternative to systemic antibiotics for long-term acne management in women.

### Acne: systemic treatment [^111zR4ev]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a disease affecting mostly adolescents and young adults that, when severe, has the potential to result in scarring and permanent disfigurement. Systemic treatment is necessary to prevent significant psychological and social impairment in these patients.(1) Significant inflammatory and nodulocystic acne is usually recalcitrant to topical treatment, whereas uncommon acne variants, such as acne fulminans, pyoderma faciale, and acne conglobata, need to be promptly and effectively controlled. In all of these circumstances, systemic agents are indispensable. The choices include oral antibiotics, isotretinoin, and hormonal treatment (Table 1).

### Prophylactic anti-staphylococcal antibiotics for cystic fibrosis [^113BdWNX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus causes pulmonary infection in young children with cystic fibrosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed hoping to prevent such infection and lung damage. Antibiotics have adverse effects and long-term use might lead to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess continuous oral antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus versus no prophylaxis in people with cystic fibrosis, we tested these hypotheses. Prophylaxis:1. improves clinical status, lung function and survival;2. causes adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, skin rash, candidiasis);3. leads to fewer isolates of common pathogens from respiratory secretions;4. leads to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and colonisation of the respiratory tract with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Companies manufacturing anti-staphylococcal antibiotics were contacted. Most recent search of the Group's Register: 29 September 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of continuous oral prophylactic antibiotics (given for at least one year) compared to intermittent antibiotics given 'as required', in people with cystic fibrosis of any disease severity.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors assessed studies for eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included four studies, with a total of 401 randomised participants aged zero to seven years on enrolment; one study is ongoing. The two older included studies generally had a higher risk of bias across all domains, but in particular due to a lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data, than the two more recent studies. We only regarded the most recent study as being generally free of bias, although even here we were not certain of the effect of the per protocol analysis on the study results. Evidence was downgraded based on GRADE assessments and outcome results ranged from moderate to low quality. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes); for imprecision (number of people needing additional antibiotics); and for inconsistency (weight z score). Fewer children receiving anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis had one or more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (low quality evidence). There was no significant difference between groups in infant or conventional lung function (moderate quality evidence). We found no significant effect on nutrition (low quality evidence), hospital admissions, additional courses of antibiotics (low quality evidence) or adverse effects (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa between groups (low quality evidence), though there was a trend towards a lower cumulative isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the prophylaxis group at two and three years and towards a higher rate from four to six years. As the studies reviewed lasted six years or less, conclusions cannot be drawn about the long-term effects of prophylaxis.

Authors' Conclusions

Anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis leads to fewer children having isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, when commenced early in infancy and continued up to six years of age. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Further research may establish whether the trend towards more children with CF with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, after four to six years of prophylaxis, is a chance finding and whether choice of antibiotic or duration of treatment might influence this.

### The duration of acne treatment [^115KtQSU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acne has a ~90% lifetime prevalence, however the duration of the condition and its treatment is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to estimate for how long acne patients are treated.

Methods

Electronic patient records from an academic practice were queried to identify dermatology visits with an acne diagnosis (ICD-9: 706.1) between January 1, 2009 and June 1, 2012. The duration of care for acne treatment was calculated as the time between the earliest and latest visits. Kaplan Meier analyses were used to describe treatment duration

Results

1,130 patients had at least one visit acne-related visit to a dermatologist, with 631 (56%) having only one visit and 499 (44%) having multiple visits over the study period. For patients with multiple visits, the mean duration from first to last visit was 0.57 year (95% CI: 0.52, 0.62); 25% ceased visiting in 0.25 year, 50% in 0.40 year, and 75% in 0.64 year.

Conclusion

Our study provides a lower limit on the duration of acne treatment. The duration of acne treatment is longer than the duration of typical acne clinical trials. Understanding the duration of the disease can help set patients' treatment expectations, which may help improve adherence.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline. pharmacologic approaches to prevention and eradication of initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^112MLFgF]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline — prophylactic antibiotics to prevent acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: In a randomized controlled trial, 65 children without P. aeruginosa for at least 2 years received inhaled colistin (1 million IU twice daily) and oral ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg/d) versus placebo for 3 weeks every 3 months for 3 years; treatment with colistin and ciprofloxacin did not reduce the risk of initial or chronic infection, with infection in Thirty-two percent (10/31) of placebo and 26% (9/34) of treated children, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.736 (95% CI, 0.299–1.822; P = 0.510). Antibiotic prophylaxis increased recovery of additional nonfermenting, gram-negative pathogens (P = 0.0094). Considering cycled therapy as prophylaxis, the EPIC trial did not demonstrate a benefit to routinely treating children with inhaled tobramycin, with or without oral ciprofloxacin, compared with treating only when P. aeruginosa was cultured. The committee did not find any benefit of routine use of antibiotics in preventing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa and cautioned that the prolonged use of antipseudomonal antibiotics may increase the risk of acquiring other potential pathogens.

### Intravenous versus oral antibiotics for eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (TORPEDO-CF): a randomised controlled trial [^115yt2ki]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Added value of this study

Our randomised controlled trial is, to our knowledge, the first to compare the effectiveness of intravenous versus oral eradication therapy in children and adults with cystic fibrosis, and showed no significant difference in the number of participants achieving eradication. In the intravenous group, fewer patients were admitted to hospital in the 12 months following eradication. However, this confers no advantage as intravenous eradication usually requires admission whereas oral treatment does not. There was a considerable difference in cost between the two eradication regimens. The study has shown that oral eradication might be used with a cost saving of £5939 (equivalent to 7543 US dollars) per patient. This is the first cost-effectiveness study done as part of a randomised controlled trial of eradication.

Implications of all the available evidence

We found that intravenous antibiotics did not achieve eradication of P aeruginosa in a greater proportion of children and adults with cystic fibrosis than oral therapy. Intravenous therapy usually requires a prolonged admission to hospital, with consequent family disruption, as well as requiring significant health-care resource. Admission for intravenous therapy in the context of early P aeruginosa infection (and without the presence of a significant pulmonary exacerbation), in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, should not be recommended.

Our trial found that, even in the oral group (which had a better primary outcome), only around half of participants were free of infection 15 months after randomisation. Future research should aim to improve rates of eradication through approaches such as earlier detection of P aeruginosa and salvage therapy for failed eradication. It should also be a priority to evaluate the effects of CFTR modulators on acquisition and eradication of P aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly prevalent pathogen in cystic fibrosis that can be acquired from the environment or from other people with cystic fibrosis. When airways infection first occurs, the organism is present in planktonic form and is susceptible to antibiotics. In the next state of infection, P aeruginosa forms biofilms in the airways, where the organisms are surrounded by exopolysaccharide matrix. This matrix confers resistance to antibiotics and host defences, and the infection becomes chronic. The presence of chronic P aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis is associated with increased mortality and morbidity (including a more rapid decline in lung function and more hospitalisations). Most people with cystic fibrosis will have chronic airways infection with P aeruginosa by their mid-20s.

### Pulmonary outcomes associated with long-term azithromycin therapy in cystic fibrosis [^115bpodS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The beneficial impact on PEx that was reported in clinical trials was not seen in our study; however, there are important differences in how these data were collected. The trial by Saiman and colleagues defined PEx events by hospitalization or ≥ 7 days of oral quinolone antibiotics. The CFFPR has collected high-quality data on intravenous antibiotic use for many years, and our analyses are limited to only patients treated with intravenous therapy. Use of oral antibiotics outside of clinical encounters and, at times, without direct knowledge of CF providers can be more difficult to track and report, even in a registry as robust as the CFFPR. We cannot comment, from these analyses, on the sustained impact that AZM may have on the use of oral or inhaled antibiotic therapy to treat acute pulmonary worsening.

In those not chronically infected with PA at baseline, we do not observe the association between AZM use and preserved lung function over 3 years of medication use. Prospective clinical trials of 6-month duration in those without PA similarly found no significant impact on FEV 1 but measured a reduced risk of acute PEx or use of oral antibiotics. When considering AZM use for 3 years, we did not find a reduced risk of PEx among AZM users who were not chronically infected with PA. Again, our analyses are limited to the use of intravenous antibiotics, and this pivotal trial similarly found no difference in the use of intravenous antibiotics based on AZM use versus placebo. Our analyses of a 3-year observational period are retrospective but able to collect many more intravenous treatment events. Altogether, our findings indicate that chronic AZM may have little to no impact on the risk of severe PEx requiring intravenous antibiotics regardless of PA status.

### Duration of oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of adult acne: a retrospective analysis investigating adherence to guideline recommendations and opportunities for cost-savings [^1154Zuue]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The duration of oral antibiotic acne therapy for adolescents compared with guidelines was recently investigated; however it was uncertain if duration of antibiotics for adult acne therapy differed.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate duration of oral antibiotics for adult acne compared with guidelines and determine possible cost-savings.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database that incorporated claims data to determine duration and costs of antibiotic treatment among adults ages 21 years and older.

Results

Of 17,448 courses, 84.5% (14,737) aligned with duration guidelines, although 12,040 (69.0%) courses did not include concomitant topical retinoid therapy. Mean savings of $592.26 per person could result if prolonged courses met guidelines. Mean (median) costs of generic and branded formulations for the most frequent course duration (90–179 days) were $103.77 ($54.27) and $1421.61 ($1462.25), respectively.

Limitations

Actual patient prescription adherence is uncertain and database lacks information regarding acne severity, patient physical characteristics, and clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

The majority of oral antibiotic course durations follow guidelines, although topical retinoids are underused. Costs of antibiotic therapy were lower for shorter courses and those using generic medications; the cost-effectiveness of these modifications has not been investigated.

### Systematic review of antibiotic resistance in acne: an increasing topical and oral threat [^114uZCHG]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Topical and oral antibiotics are routinely used to treat acne. However, antibiotic resistance is increasing, with many countries reporting that more than 50% of Propionibacterium acnes strains are resistant to topical macrolides, making them less effective. We reviewed the current scientific literature to enable proposal of recommendations for antibiotic use in acne treatment. References were identified through PubMed searches for articles published from January, 1954, to March 7, 2015, using four multiword searches. Ideally, benzoyl peroxide in combination with a topical retinoid should be used instead of a topical antibiotic to minimise the impact of resistance. Oral antibiotics still have a role in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, but only with a topical retinoid, benzoyl peroxide, or their combination, and ideally for no longer than 3 months. To limit resistance, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide should always be added when long-term oral antibiotic use is deemed necessary. The benefit-to-risk ratio of long-term antibiotic use should be carefully considered and, in particular, use alone avoided where possible. There is a need to treat acne with effective alternatives to antibiotics to reduce the likelihood of resistance.

### Optimizing the trial design for a comparative effectiveness study of spironolactone versus oral antibiotics for women with acne: a Delphi consensus panel [^113VSipv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

For women with acne, their acne often persists into adulthood, with over 50% of women reporting acne between 20&ndash;29 years of age and over 35% of women reporting acne between 30&ndash;39 years of age.1 While mild acne can usually be managed with topical medications, moderate to severe acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, spironolactone, and isotretinoin.2 Although oral antibiotics are the most common systemic medication prescribed for women with moderate to severe acne, spironolactone may represent a safe and effective therapeutic alternative that can decrease our reliance on oral antibiotics for the treatment of acne.3&ndash;5 However, while spironolactone use is increasing, oral antibiotics are still prescribed 3 to 5 times more often than spironolactone.3.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113679yM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotics indications and dosing — Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne treatment for years; they are indicated for use in moderate to severe inflammatory acne and should be used in combination with a topical retinoid and BP. Evidence supports the efficacy of tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), trimethoprim, erythromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered first-line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated because of other circumstances (ie, pregnancy, < 8 years of age, or allergy). Minocycline in an extended release form appears safest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found for efficacy; doxycycline appears effective in the 1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range, and subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to 40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients with moderate inflammatory acne. Azithromycin has been primarily studied in the treatment of acne in open label studies with different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3 times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycin being an effective treatment in the time span evaluated — usually 2 to 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days per month of azithromycin to daily doxycycline did show superiority of doxycycline. Outside of case reports, there is 1 small, double-blind study showing that TMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline.

### Antibiotic resistance in acne treatment [^116uBu43]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the evidence for antibiotic resistance in acne, and how does resistance affect treatment?

Bottom Line

Use of topical and systemic antibiotics for acne is associated with formation of resistance in Propionibacterium acnes and other bacteria, with clinical consequences. Guidelines recommend resistance reduction strategies including avoidance of antibiotic monotherapy, combination treatment with topical modalities, and limiting the duration of oral antibiotic use.

### Management of acne vulgaris: an evidence-based update [^114f59ic]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

This review summarizes clinically important findings from 3 systematic reviews, 1 updated guideline and a selection from the 62 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between February 2007 and January 2009 on the topic of acne vulgaris. Low glycaemic-load diets might reduce acne severity but this remains unproven. Written patient information leaflets have not been surpassed by other communication methods. New combination topical treatments have not shown convincing advantages over current combination products such as clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. Topical dapsone is superior to placebo but has yet to be compared with standard topical treatments. Long-term topical tretinoin to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer in elderly men was associated with higher all-cause mortality, but there is currently no evidence of increased mortality for topical retinoid use when treating acne. All oral tetracyclines have similar efficacy, yet minocycline is the most costly. Oral isotretinoin monotherapy remains the gold-standard treatment for severe acne. Flutamide plus the oral contraceptive pill is beneficial for acne associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Photodynamic therapy, phototherapy and laser therapy cannot be recommended universally for acne until minimal postinflammatory pigmentation and longer-term benefit can be shown, especially with current high costs. Development of non-antibiotic therapies is preferable to minimize the risk of community antibiotic resistance. Future trials should use active comparators at optimum doses and avoid noninferiority comparisons unless appropriately powered. Trials need to shift from using multiple, unvalidated outcome measures to including patient-reported and quality-of-life outcomes, and all trials should be registered on a public clinical-trials database.

### The use of oral antibiotics before isotretinoin therapy in patients with acne [^114jZnRc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic antibiotics are used widely to treat moderate to severe acne, but increasing antibiotic resistance makes appropriate use a priority.

Objective

We sought to determine the duration of systemic antibiotic use in patients with inflammatory/nodulocystic acne who eventually required isotretinoin.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single-site chart review of patients with acne diagnostic codes evaluated January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2014, at a dermatology practice in an academic medical center. Included patients were prescribed isotretinoin during the study period and received 30 days or more of antibiotics.

Results

The average duration of antibiotic use was 331.3 days. In all, 21 patients (15.3%) were prescribed antibiotics for 3 months or less, 88 patients (64.2%) for 6 months or more, and 46 patients (33.6%) for 1 year or longer. Patients treated only at the study site had a mean duration of antibiotic treatment of 283.1 days whereas patients who also received antibiotics from another institution had a mean duration of 380.2 days. This difference approached statistical significance (P = 0.054).

Limitations

This study was limited to a single center.

Conclusion

Expert guidelines recommend responsible use of antibiotics in acne in light of emerging resistance. We found that patients who eventually received isotretinoin had extended exposure to antibiotics, exceeding recommendations. Early recognition of antibiotic failure and the need for isotretinoin can curtail antibiotic use.

Patients

Male and female outpatients aged 12–49 years were eligible if they had facial acne (excluding periocular and lip lesions) characterized by 11–40 IL (erythematous papules and pustules), 20–100 non‐IL (open and closed comedones) and two or fewer nodules/cysts at baseline (Table S2).

Before enrollment in the observation period, the following patients were excluded: patients who had complications of other facial acne than acne vulgaris, rosacea or skin diseases that may cause a facial rash (such as atopic dermatitis); female patients who had fluctuation in acne symptoms with the menstrual cycle; female patients who were pregnant, breast‐feeding or hoping to become pregnant; patients who had exhibited hypersensitivity or previous allergic reactions to any component of the study drugs; and patients who had serious complications (including systemic diseases) which precluded participation in the study. After the observation period, patients with low study drug compliance (< 70%) or high reduction rate (> 30%) in the number of IL during the observation period were excluded from entering the treatment phase. The following patients were also excluded: patients who used systemic or topical retinoids, or 14‐day or longer systemic antibiotics within 12 weeks prior to the beginning of the treatment period; anti‐acne medications (excluding vitamins B2 and B6), steroids, antibiotics or other drugs within 4 weeks (systemic use) or 2 weeks (local application) prior to the beginning of the treatment period, or quasi drugs or cosmetics for the treatment of facial acne; patients who underwent chemical peeling, laser ray treatment or other therapies for acne, which may have an influence on the efficacy of the study drug, within 4 weeks prior to the beginning of the treatment period; or patients who participated in another clinical study within 4 months prior to the beginning of the treatment period.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: antibiotic stewardship in acne: 2023 update [^112aBRji]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics, topical and oral, are a cornerstone in the treatment of acnes vulgaris specifically by targeting the skin bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Billions of individuals have received antibiotics as part of their treatment resulting in a worldwide pandemic of antibiotic resistance not only for C. acnes but also many other pathogens. With the increasing prevalence of acne and exponentially increasing utilization of antibiotics, prescribers must urgently embrace the notion of antibiotic stewardship to maintain the efficacy of acne treatments while attenuating the rise of resistance. This paper serves as an update on C. acnes resistance to antibiotics commonly employed in the treatment of acne and the necessity of implementing benzoyl peroxide in the treatment&nbsp; regimen as monotherapy or combination antibiotic therapies for overcoming and preventing resistance.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^115WGumd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Indeed, 0.3% A/BPO may fill a gap as a single-agent treatment for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Pediatric guidelines recommend that an oral antibiotic be started concomitantly with topical combination therapy (i.e. topical retinoid and BPO) promptly to prevent scarring in severe acne, when there is evidence of scarring even in moderate acne, or as a step-up regimen if initial therapeutic response with topical therapy is not adequate. European guidance suggests that for moderate acne, an oral antibiotic should be initiated upon the presentation of more widespread disease. Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be able to substitute antibiotics in the interest of minimizing antibiotic resistance in cases where the addition of systemic antibiotic therapy is considered, particularly as its mechanism of action includes prevention of microcomedone formation. International guidelines for acne management stipulate that oral isotretinoin remains the gold standard for severe acne treatment. Recent guidance for the pediatric population suggests that oral isotretinoin is no longer indicated as first-line treatment, but instead only after inadequate response with initial treatment using combination therapy (topical treatment associated with oral antibiotic). Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be an appropriate treatment, alone or in combination with other therapies, prior to the potential need for step-up treatment to oral isotretinoin, or while enrolling the patient in the required programs to obtain access to oral isotretinoin. Furthermore, 0.3% A/BPO may be seen as a replacement for existing topical combination therapies used with oral antibiotics in not only moderate acne but also in severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne (although, perhaps not exclusively).

### Rethinking treatment of acne in the severe patient [^111GU91s]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Managing acne continues to be a challenge. The data presented here provide a rationale for rethinking our approach to the use of oral antibiotics in moderate-to-severe acne and suggest strategies that favor combination regimens that limit the use of oral antibiotics.
