## Question

What are the reasons for cgm gmi to be much lower than a1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the glucose management indicator (GMI) from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be much lower than the laboratory hemoglobin A1c, and what explains that discordance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what GMI actually represents and how it is calculated. Then, I should verify what A1c measures and why it might diverge from average glucose. Next, I will examine the key sources of discordance, including biological variation in glycation, red blood cell turnover and lifespan, CGM technical and data-sufficiency issues, and population or device-specific factors. After that, I should quantify how often this happens and how large the differences can be. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications and a decision framework for when to trust GMI, when to trust A1c, and when to use alternative markers or adjusted models.

> Let me first confirm the constructs. GMI is an estimate of A1c derived from CGM mean glucose using a population regression equation, typically based on about 14 days of data, and it is intended to approximate A1c but is not a direct substitute for it, whereas A1c is a laboratory measurement reflecting weighted average glycemia over roughly 2–3 months and is influenced by red blood cell biology and assay characteristics [^116RAbvn] [^115fjCzy] [^116RAbvn].

> Wait, let me verify the biological mismatch. A1c reflects glycation of hemoglobin over the lifespan of red blood cells, so anything that alters RBC turnover or lifespan can change A1c independent of true average glucose. Shorter RBC lifespan or increased RBC production lowers A1c relative to mean glucose, while longer lifespan or altered glycation chemistry can raise it, and these effects are well described in anemia, hemoglobinopathies, liver disease, pregnancy, and chronic kidney disease, which can all create a gap between A1c and GMI [^114JYUYZ] [^111wtfHM] [^112HCwmT] [^11615aSG].

> Hold on, I should verify the directionality. In many patients with CKD, anemia, or iron deficiency, A1c tends to be higher than expected from mean glucose, so GMI calculated from CGM mean glucose can appear lower than A1c. Conversely, in some settings like iron therapy or recovery from anemia, A1c can fall sharply as RBC turnover normalizes even if mean glucose is unchanged, again making GMI look lower than A1c, and this pattern is reproducible within individuals over time [^112HCwmT] [^113eHvU8].

> I need to check CGM-specific issues next. GMI is only as reliable as the CGM data quality and duration. Insufficient sensor wear, calibration problems, or interstitial-to-blood glucose lag during rapid changes can degrade the mean glucose estimate and thus the GMI, and discordance is more likely when CGM use is intermittent or when there are frequent gaps in data, which is why guidelines emphasize at least 14 days with more than 70% data capture for robust metrics [^116RAbvn] [^115mQu5D] [^116LegJz].

> But wait, what if the equation itself is off for this person or device. The GMI formula was derived from specific CGM systems and predominantly non-Hispanic White cohorts, and it assumes a fixed relationship between mean glucose and A1c. Individual variation in the glucose–A1c relationship and device-specific biases can therefore produce systematic discordance, and some manufacturers or populations may show consistent over- or underestimation of A1c by GMI, reinforcing the need to interpret GMI alongside, not instead of, A1c [^116RAbvn] [^113jZNjk] [^116XnqV1].

> Let me quantify how often and how much they differ. Large observational datasets show that GMI and A1c differ by more than 0.5% in roughly one-third to one-half of individuals, with differences exceeding 1.0% in a meaningful minority. In CKD cohorts, discordance exceeding 0.5% occurs in about two-thirds of patients, and in older adults with type 1 diabetes, nearly half show an absolute difference of at least 0.5%, underscoring that this is not a rare anomaly [^116RAbvn] [^112HCwmT] [^115Zqg9c].

> I should double-check the clinical implications. When GMI is substantially lower than A1c, clinicians may be tempted to intensify therapy to "close the gap", but that risks hypoglycemia if the A1c is artifactually elevated due to RBC turnover or glycation biology. Conversely, if GMI is higher than A1c, therapy may appear more effective than it truly is, so the safest approach is to reconcile the discrepancy by reviewing CGM time-in-range, time-below-range, and glycemic variability, and by reassessing A1c reliability in the context of anemia, CKD, or recent changes in iron status [^111Cy3rP] [^115fjCzy] [^116XLazE].

> Next, I should review practical steps. First, verify CGM data sufficiency and sensor performance. Second, evaluate hematologic parameters such as hemoglobin, MCV, and RDW to screen for anemia or altered RBC turnover. Third, consider alternative markers like fructosamine or glycated albumin when A1c is unreliable, especially in CKD or pregnancy. Fourth, if discordance persists, track the individual's HbA1c–GMI difference over time, since it tends to be relatively consistent within a person and can guide individualized targets and expectations [^116RAbvn] [^114JYUYZ] [^113eHvU8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing A1c with GMI. Professional societies advise using CGM metrics, including GMI and time-in-range, alongside A1c rather than substituting for it, because each captures different aspects of glycemia and risk. GMI is useful for near-term feedback and titration, but A1c remains the standard for long-term complication risk stratification and population-level targets, and this complementary approach is especially important in people with high glycemic variability or conditions that distort A1c [^115fjCzy] [^116RAbvn] [^117A7Z4Z].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: GMI can be much lower than A1c primarily because A1c is influenced by red blood cell lifespan and glycation biology that are not captured by short-term CGM mean glucose, and secondarily because of CGM data quality, device and population calibration, and the assumption of a fixed glucose–A1c relationship. Recognizing and reconciling this discordance prevents overtreatment or undertreatment and supports safer, more personalized diabetes management [^111Cy3rP] [^111wtfHM] [^112HCwmT].

---

GMI can be lower than A1c because **GMI reflects short-term (≈10–14 days) average glucose** [^116RAbvn], whereas A1c reflects **≈2–3 months** of glycemia [^115fjCzy] and is affected by red blood cell turnover, anemia, and hemoglobinopathies [^111wtfHM]. Discordance is common: **about 50% have a difference ≥ 0.5%**, and **about 20% have a difference ≥ 1.0%** [^116RAbvn]. Clinicians should interpret GMI alongside A1c and CGM metrics (TIR, TBR, CV) [^116XLazE] and investigate persistent discordance with hemoglobin/hematology, kidney function, and alternative markers (fructosamine, glycated albumin) [^114JYUYZ] [^112HCwmT].

---

## Physiological and biological differences

### Timeframe of measurement

GMI reflects **short-term glycemia** — approximately 10–14 days [^114Lcxqo] — whereas A1c reflects **long-term glycemia** — approximately 2–3 months [^115fjCzy]. Thus, recent improvements in glucose control can lower GMI without immediately affecting A1c.

---

### Red blood cell turnover and lifespan

Variations in RBC turnover and lifespan can **significantly affect A1c** [^111wtfHM]. Conditions such as anemia, hemoglobinopathies, or recent blood loss can shorten RBC lifespan, leading to falsely low A1c relative to true average glucose [^112ZpJFv]. GMI, derived from interstitial glucose, is **not affected by RBC turnover** and may more accurately reflect current glycemia in these settings [^115UyH7a].

---

### Individual variability in glycation

Individuals vary in their propensity for **hemoglobin glycation** at a given glucose level, a trait that is relatively stable over time [^113eHvU8]. This variability can cause persistent differences between GMI and A1c, with some individuals consistently showing lower GMI than A1c.

---

## Technical and methodological factors

### CGM accuracy and calibration

CGM accuracy depends on **sensor calibration, placement, and individual factors** [^113QMB3Q]. Poor calibration or sensor issues can lead to inaccurate mean glucose and, consequently, an inaccurate GMI [^112ksXJG].

---

### Data sufficiency and duration

GMI reliability depends on **adequate CGM data** [^115mQu5D]. Insufficient data (< 70% of days) can lead to misleading GMI values [^116RAbvn].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

### Clinical decision-making

Persistent discordance between GMI and A1c should prompt **clinical evaluation** [^1151U1nr]. Clinicians should consider:

- **Hematologic evaluation**: Assess for anemia, hemoglobinopathies, or altered RBC turnover [^111wtfHM].
- **Kidney function**: Evaluate for CKD, which can affect A1c accuracy [^112HCwmT].
- **Alternative markers**: Use fructosamine or glycated albumin when A1c is unreliable [^114JYUYZ].

---

### Individualized glycemic targets

Given the potential for discordance, **individualized targets** should incorporate both A1c and CGM metrics (TIR, TBR, CV) [^116XLazE] to optimize glycemic control and minimize hypoglycemia [^112ofHH6].

---

## Summary of reasons for GMI being lower than A1c

| **Category** | **Reasons** |
|-|-|
| Physiological | - Shorter timeframe of GMI <br/> - RBC turnover/lifespan <br/> - Individual glycation variability |
| Technical | - CGM accuracy/calibration <br/> - Data sufficiency |
| Clinical | - Anemia <br/> - Hemoglobinopathies <br/> - CKD <br/> - Recent glucose improvement |

---

GMI can be lower than A1c due to differences in measurement timeframe, RBC turnover, individual glycation variability, and CGM technical factors. Clinicians should **interpret GMI alongside A1c and CGM metrics** and investigate persistent discordance to guide safe, effective therapy.

### Understanding the clinical implications of differences between glucose management indicator and glycated haemoglobin [^111Cy3rP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for assessing glycaemic control in people with diabetes and correlates with their risk of long-term complications. The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has highlighted limitations of HbA1c testing. HbA1c can only be reviewed infrequently and can mask the risk of hypoglycaemia or extreme glucose fluctuations. While CGM provides insights in to the risk of hypoglycaemia as well as daily fluctuations of glucose, it can also be used to calculate an estimated HbA1c that has been used as a substitute for laboratory HbA1c. However, it is evident that estimated HbA1c and HbA1c values can differ widely. The glucose management indicator (GMI), calculated exclusively from CGM data, has been proposed. It uses the same scale (% or mmol/mol) as HbA1c, but is based on short-term average glucose values, rather than long-term glucose exposure. HbA1c and GMI values differ in up to 81% of individuals by more than ± 0.1% and by more than ± 0.3% in 51% of cases. Here, we review the factors that define these differences, such as the time period being assessed, the variation in glycation rates and factors such as anaemia and haemoglobinopathies. Recognizing and understanding the factors that cause differences between HbA1c and GMI is an important clinical skill. In circumstances when HbA1c is elevated above GMI, further attempts at intensification of therapy based solely on the HbA1c value may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. The observed difference between GMI and HbA1c also informs the important question about the predictive ability of GMI regarding long-term complications.

### Glucose management indicator (GMI): a new term for estimating A1c from continuous glucose monitoring [^114Lcxqo]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

While A1C is well established as an important risk marker for diabetes complications, with the increasing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to help facilitate safe and effective diabetes management, it is important to understand how CGM metrics, such as mean glucose, and A1C correlate. Estimated A1C (eA1C) is a measure converting the mean glucose from CGM or self-monitored blood glucose readings, using a formula derived from glucose readings from a population of individuals, into an estimate of a simultaneously measured laboratory A1C. Many patients and clinicians find the eA1C to be a helpful educational tool, but others are often confused or even frustrated if the eA1C and laboratory-measured A1C do not agree. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration determined that the nomenclature of eA1C needed to change. This led the authors to work toward a multipart solution to facilitate the retention of such a metric, which includes renaming the eA1C the glucose management indicator (GMI) and generating a new formula for converting CGM-derived mean glucose to GMI based on recent clinical trials using the most accurate CGM systems available. The final aspect of ensuring a smooth transition from the old eA1C to the new GMI is providing new CGM analyses and explanations to further understand how to interpret GMI and use it most effectively in clinical practice. This Perspective will address why a new name for eA1C was needed, why GMI was selected as the new name, how GMI is calculated, and how to understand and explain GMI if one chooses to use GMI as a tool in diabetes education or management.

### The glucose management indicator: time to change course? [^113jBQBd]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has, for decades, been the standard approach to monitoring glucose control in people with diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a revolutionary technology that can also aid in the monitoring of glucose control. However, there is uncertainty in how best to use CGM technology and its resulting data to improve control of glucose and prevent complications of diabetes. The glucose management indicator, or GMI, is an equation used to estimate HbA1c based on CGM mean glucose. GMI was originally proposed to simplify and aid in the interpretation of CGM data and is now provided on all standard summary reports (i.e., average glucose profiles) produced by different CGM manufacturers. This Perspective demonstrates that GMI performs poorly as an estimate of HbA1c and suggests that GMI is a concept that has outlived its usefulness, and it argues that it is preferable to use CGM mean glucose rather than converting glucose to GMI or an estimate of HbA1c. Leaving mean glucose in its raw form is simple and reinforces that glucose and HbA1c are distinct. To reduce patient and provider confusion and optimize glycemic management, mean CGM glucose, not GMI, should be used as a complement to laboratory HbA1c testing in patients using CGM systems.

### Managing discordance between hbAand glucose management indicator [^112ksXJG]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The assessment of haemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c) continues to play an essential role in diabetes care; however, major advances in new technologies widen the armament available to clinicians to further refine treatment for their patients. Whilst HbA 1c remains a critical glycaemic marker, advances in technologies such as Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) now offer real-time glucose monitoring, allowing a more instant assessment of glycaemic control. Discrepancies between laboratory-measured HbA 1c and Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) values are a significant clinical issue. In this article, we present a checklist of potential sources of error for both GMI and HbA 1c values and provide suggestions to mitigate these sources in order to continue to improve diabetes care.

Methods

We identified key literature pertaining to GMI measurement, HbA 1c measurement, and potential factors of discordance between the two. Using these sources, we explore the potential factors leading to discordance and how to mitigate these when found.

Results

We have constructed a quick reference checklist covering the main sources of discordance between HbA 1c and GMI, with accompanying narrative text for more detailed discussion. Discordance can arise due to various factors, including CGM accuracy, sensor calibration, red blood cell turnover and other physiological conditions.

Conclusions

GMI will likely continue to be used in the upcoming years by both persons with diabetes and their health care providers, and so it is important for users of CGM devices to be equipped with the knowledge to understand the potential causes of discordance between GMI and HbA 1c values.

### A view beyond HbA1c: role of continuous glucose monitoring [^115wPB62]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Large fluctuations in blood glucose are dangerous and should be considered to be an important treatment target. Achieving this treatment targets will require the use of newer glucose-lowering agents (such as incretin hormones or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2]), more rapid-acting prandial insulins, stable ("flat") long-acting insulins, and more routine use of CGM in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM.

Average glucose, GMI, time spent in hyperglycemia, and time spent in the target range are general indicators of overall glucose management. However, additional metrics, such as time spent in hypoglycemia and GV, supply the patient and healthcare provider with critical information beyond the A1C value, by providing objective data on various safety concerns that need to be addressed in the diabetes management plan.

### A view beyond HbA1c: role of continuous glucose monitoring [^1166DVMG]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is used as an index of average blood glucose measurement over a period of months and is a mainstay of blood glucose monitoring. This metric is easy to measure and relatively inexpensive to obtain, and it predicts diabetes-related microvascular complications. However, HbA1c provides only an approximate measure of glucose control; it does not address short-term glycemic variability (GV) or hypoglycemic events. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a tool which helps clinicians and people with diabetes to overcome the limitations of HbA1c in diabetes management. Time spent in the glycemic target range and time spent in hypoglycemia are the main CGM metrics that provide a more personalized approach to diabetes management. Moreover, the glucose management indicator (GMI), which calculates an approximate HbA1c level based on the average CGM-driven glucose level, facilitates individual decision-making when the laboratory-measured HbA1c and estimated HbA1c are discordant. GV, on the other hand, is a measure of swings in blood glucose levels over hours or days and may contribute to diabetes-related complications. In addition, addressing GV is a major challenge during the optimization of glycemia. The degree of GV is associated with the frequency, duration, and severity of the hypoglycemic events. Many factors affect GV in a patient, including lifestyle, diet, the presence of comorbidities, and diabetes therapy. Recent evidence supports the use of some glucose-lowering agents to improve GV, such as the new ultra-long acting insulin analogs, as these agents have a smoother pharmacodynamic profile and improve glycemic control with fewer fluctuations and fewer nocturnal hypoglycemic events. These newer glucose-lowering agents (such as incretin hormones or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) can also reduce the degree of GV. However, randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of GV on important diabetes outcomes. In this review, we discuss the role of HbA1c as a measure of glycemic control and its limitations. We also explore additional glycemic metrics, with a focus on time (duration) in glucose target range, time (duration) in hypoglycemia, GV, GMI, and their correlation with clinical outcomes.

eA1C and Glucose Management Indicator

eA1c and Measured Laboratory HbA1c

With the increasing use of CGM to facilitate safe and effective diabetes management, it is important to understand how CGM metrics, namely eA1c, correlates with and can be used as a metric instead of or in addition to HbA1c. eA1c for every single patient is calculated based on CGM readings from a population of individuals. In some patients, the results of a laboratory-measured HbA1c and eA1c are approximately the same, but in others, the eA1c may be either higher or lower than the measured HbA1c. This issue is discussed in a recent publication by Beck et al. who suggested that a laboratory-measured HbA1c of 8.0% can be associated with a range of eA1c of 7–8.5%. The discordance can be confusing for both patients and clinicians. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration determined that the nomenclature of eA1c needs to be changed, leading to the generation of a new index: the glucose management indicator (GMI). The results from the HypoDE study and from a prior study were used to generate a pooled equation to convert CGM-derived mean glucose to the GMI:

Based on this formula, an increment of 25 mg/dL in mean glucose corresponds to a 0.6% increase in GMI.

GMI Versus Laboratory-Measured HbA1c

The difference between the GMI and laboratory-measured HbA1c in 528 individuals with diabetes who had both values measured concurrently was evaluated by Bergenstal et al. and showed in 19% of the measurements, the GMI, calculated from CGM-derived mean glucose, and laboratory-measured HbA1c have identical values; however, in 28% of the measurements, the difference between the two values is > 0.5%. Therefore, the introduction of GMI as a new glucose index could be an important step in the direction of a more personalized diabetes management program. If a person has a GMI that is always considerably lower than a measured HbA1c, the healthcare professional has to be careful not to set the therapeutic goal too low to overcome the risk of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, if the GMI is higher, it may be safe to set the HbA1c target slightly lower to minimize excessive hyperglycemia. It should be noted that current evidence indicates that the difference in laboratory-measured HbA1c and GMI remains relatively stable for each individual over time.

### Level of agreement and correlation between the estimated hemoglobin A1c results derived by continuous or conventional glucose monitoring systems compared with the point-of-care or laboratory-based measurements: an observational study [^1163BBGw]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Measuring the time to glycemic target range or hypoglycemia, glucose management indicators, and changes in blood glucose levels over hours or days using CGM devices provides a more personalized approach to diabetes management, and it may contribute to overcoming diabetes-related complications. Thus, ADA currently considers CGM a valuable part of diabetes self-management and the standard of care for diabetic patients treated with intensive insulin therapy. However, reports have shown a discordance between the HbA1c data measured by CGM compared to the standard laboratory HbA1c. The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown. Bergenstal et al. reported a possible explanation for the potential variation between the laboratory and GMI. The average glucose and hence the GMI values will be higher than a laboratory HbA1c (tested at the same time) during periods of hyperglycemia because the laboratory test represents glucose levels predominantly during the last 2–3 months. Beck et al. reported that a laboratory HbA1C of 8.0% could be associated with a CGM-measured mean estimated HbA1C of 7.0% to 8.5%. This result is in agreement with the results of the ADAG study. As a result, relying solely on laboratory HbA1c or GMI to measure glycemic control may mislead clinical judgments. On the other hand, Liu et al. assessed the impact of glycemic variability on the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c. They observed a discrepancy between the GMI (measured by the iPro TM 2 system) and the laboratory HbA1c in T1DM patients (mainly in patients with high hemoglobin glycation index). This result is similar to those highlighted by a previous study by Hempe et al. who linked this discrepancy to the individual variations in laboratory HbA1c.

### Level of agreement and correlation between the estimated hemoglobin A1c results derived by continuous or conventional glucose monitoring systems compared with the point-of-care or laboratory-based measurements: an observational study [^115NN6Qr]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The agreement between the laboratory HbA1c, GMI by CGM, or the eAG by conventional SMBG is uncertain, and this study contributes valuable data to resolve these discrepancies. However, our study was limited by the relatively small sample size of patients from a single site, which might limit the generalizability of the study results. Therefore, a larger multicenter study is warranted. The relatively small range of HbA1c (almost all patients were within a range between 7.5 and 9%) may have influenced the study findings because the lack of lower HbA1c data can bias the level of the agreement since these patients often show a high variation of glucose values with unrecognized hypoglycemic events. Another limitation was that most patients with T2DM were treated with oral medication alone or BOT; only 20% were treated with MDI. Furthermore, there were relatively few blood glucose measurements. This may have led to a selection bias of patients with stable glucose values and a better level of agreement between SMBG and HbA1c.

AACE diabetes technology — CGM data sufficiency, the glucose management indicator (GMI), and its relation to A1C are summarized as follows: It has been demonstrated that > 70% use of CGM over the most recent 14 days strongly correlates with 3 months of mean glucose, TIRs, and hypoglycemia metrics. The GMI is a new metric that replaces the estimated A1C and provides an estimate of the A1C based on an average of the CGM glucose levels an individual has been experiencing; Table 2 relates CGM-derived average glucose (mg/dL) to GMI (%) with examples 100→5.7, 150→6.9, 200→8.1, and 300→10.5. In a recent study of 641 individuals with T1D, 11% of participants had discordance between the A1C and the GMI of < 0.1%, although 50% and 22% had differences of ≥ 0.5% and ≥ 1.0%, respectively.

2 DEFINING

GMI was previously described as estimated A 1c, with the name (falsely) suggesting that the estimated HbA 1c would give a similar result as HbA 1c measured in a laboratory or with point‐of‐care (POC) devices. To avoid confusion between the derived estimated A 1c and a laboratory (or POC) measured HbA 1c, the name was changed to GMI. The A 1c ‐Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study in 2006–2007 generated an equation used to estimate mean glucose based on HbA 1c. The GMI equation is effectively the reverse of this and uses a mean glucose value to approximate an HbA 1c value (GMI). Questions were raised by Norris and Lang as to the validity of the equation and they suggested a revision of the ADAG‐ and DCCT‐based mean average glucose to estimate A 1c. Since the ADAG study, many more formulas and kinetic models have been introduced to estimate HbA 1c. However, it is often unclear which equations are used by different CGM devices to estimate HbA 1c.

There are often discrepancies between measured HbA 1c and GMI derived from CGM data. These inconsistencies can cause confusion among health care providers and persons with diabetes. An expert recently suggested that GMI should not be reported as it does not always accurately reflect HbA 1c values and instead rely on CGM mean glucose. A counter response argued that most health care providers and persons with diabetes do not have the contextual experience or knowledge of how to interpret mean glucose and how much of a change in mean glucose is clinically meaningful, whereas HbA 1c is better understood. Given the increase in CGM users and the increasing tendency towards more remote diabetes care, we believe that persons with diabetes and health care providers will continue to use GMI, irrespective of any merits or demerits. Therefore, it is important to increase awareness of potential discordance between GMI and HbA 1c values, acknowledging that both metrics have underlying sources of error, understanding and identifying potential causes, and being able to investigate and mitigate these causes, where possible.

9 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

The evolution in both HbA 1c measurement and CGM technologies is transforming diabetes management with a shift towards more personalised and real‐time approaches to therapeutic interventions. It is important to understand the purpose and value of these tests so that they can be used safely and effectively in patient care. CGM is a tool for providing real‐time management of diabetes, and HbA 1c is a monitoring tool used to demonstrate the efficacy of that management. The rate of change of GMI may prove useful as a tool to assess more immediately the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. Both markers can provide valuable insight into patient care and are complementary indicators. However, health professionals should be cognisant of the role they expect these markers to play in patient management before their use.

We propose that an absolute difference of 9 mmol/mol (0.8%) between GMI and HbA 1c is considered a significant discordance, warranting further investigation. The checklist presented in this article helps persons with diabetes and health care providers identify the possible causes for discordance and proposes actions to mitigate these where possible.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: practical use of continuous glucose monitoring [^111gtKMb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

What is AGP?

It is a summary report that includes useful information for the clinician to make practical clinical decisions. An international expert panel has provided guidance on CGM metrics as a standard for assessing glycaemic control. They concluded that retrospective analysis of CGM data using a standardised AGP should be used to help patients set their glycaemic goals. CGM metrics such as time in range (time spent between 3.9 and 10 mmol/L) can be used as a clinical target and an outcome measure together with HbA1c. NICE recommends achieving a target HbA1c of < 48 mmol/mol in CYP in the UK. Seventy per cent of time spent in range (TIR) correlates with HbA1c of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). An increase in time spent in the range of 2.4 hours (10%) corresponds to a decrease in HbA1c of approximately 5 mmol/mol (0.5%). AGP profile also calculates a glucose management indicator (GMI). GMI is an estimate of HbA1c based on 14 or more days of glucose data. Figure 4 shows an example of an AGP.

Figure 4
Example of an AGP (ambulatory glucose profile).

Why do we need a new metric?

HbA1c has been the gold standard for long-term monitoring of Type 1 diabetes since Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in the 1990s showed that intensive diabetes management reduced the incidence and progression of long-term microvascular complication in adolescents and adults with Type 1 diabetes. There are however limitations in using HbA1c alone to guide strategies for improving diabetes control. HbA1c cannot provide information on glycaemic variability on a day to day basis. Regular hypoglycaemic episodes will lead to low HbA1c without providing the true picture of glycaemic control. Iron deficiency anaemia, haemoglobinopathies and ethnicity also affect HbA1c.

### The relationship between CGM-derived metrics, A1c, and risk of hypoglycemia in older adults with type 1 diabetes [^115Zqg9c]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is now commonly used in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The CGM-derived coefficient of variation (CV) measures glucose variability, and the glucose management indicator (GMI) measures mean glycemia (previously called estimated A1C). However, their relationship with laboratory-measured A1C and the risk of hypoglycemia in older adults with T1D is not well studied.

Research Design and Methods

In a single-center study, older adults (age ≥ 65 years) with T1D wore a CGM device for 14 days. The CV (%) and GMI were calculated, and A1C and clinical and demographic information were collected.

Results

We evaluated 130 older adults (age 71 ± 5 years), of whom 55% were women, 97% were White, diabetes duration was 39 ± 17 years, and A1C was 7.3 ± 0.6% (56 ± 15 mmol/mol). Participants were stratified by high CV (> 36%; n = 77) and low CV (≤ 36%; n = 53). Although there was no difference in A1C levels between the groups with high and low CV (7.3% [56 mmol/mol] vs. 7.3% [53 mmol/mol], P = 0.4), the high CV group spent more time in hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL and ≤ 54 mg/dL) compared with the group with low CV (median 31 vs. 84 min/day, P < 0.0001; 8 vs. 46 min/day, P < 0.001, respectively). An absolute difference between A1C and GMI of ≥ 0.5% was observed in 46% of the cohort. When the A1C was higher than the GMI by ≥ 0.5%, a higher duration of hypoglycemia was observed (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In older adults with T1D, the use of CGM-derived CV and GMI can better identify individuals at higher risk for hypoglycemia compared with A1C alone. These measures should be combined with A1C for better diabetes management in older adults with T1D.

### Consistency of the personalized glycated haemoglobin (pHbA1c) methodology over time in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring [^113RcXhv]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of the association between glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and glucose control in 1968, HbA1c has been adopted globally and continues to be the primary marker for overall glycaemic control due to its convenience, wide availability and evidence base for association with diabetes complications. This measure is dependent on assay performance, blood glucose levels, the glycation process itself and the lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs). With the widespread adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), it is becoming clear that glucose metrics and HbA1c may be discordant.

Recent studies have looked at the agreement between CGM‐derived glucose management index (GMI) and HbA1c in diabetes and non‐diabetes populations and have provided insights regarding appropriate clinical interpretations, highlighting where more data are needed. The difference between GMI and laboratory HbA1c (labHbA1c) can be clinically significant and may have implications for clinical risk.

In a group of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we recently reported that individuals in the highest tertile of reading‐to‐reading glucose change showed the greatest change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and that those with a higher proportion of glucose readings > 18 mmol/L also showed a fall in eGFR while experiencing higher rates of sight‐threatening retinopathy, as did people with higher mean glucose.

The size of the mismatch can be significant between GMI and labHBA1c for any individual, perhaps more than has been appreciated when the association between average glucose and HbA1c was first established by the A1C‐Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study and adopted in the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care, as well as other international guidelines.

A new glycaemic measure, personalised HbA1c (pHbA1c), was developed from first principles to calculate a value equivalent to the laboratory‐measured HbA1c from the average measured by CGM that may address the inaccuracies of HbA1c as a measure of glycaemia by accounting for interindividual variability in RBC glycation and lifespan. This is essential not only for monitoring in diabetes but also for decisions about potential treatment changes. There are also implications for the way that HbA1c is applied in screening for type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Glycemic assessment: KDIGO guidelines

The Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group recently updated the guidelines for the management of diabetes in CKD. The guidelines recommend the use of A1C to assess glycemic control in patients with CKD. The recommendation is graded Level 1 (We Recommend) C (Low Quality of Evidence). The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence supporting the use of A1C in the general population, including A1C's diagnostic and predictive validity and A1C's use as a treatment target in clinical trials. The guidelines note the unreliability of A1C in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and kidney failure treated with dialysis). Alternative biomarkers of glycemia are not recommended due to the lack of prospective observational or clinical trial data in patients with CKD.

The KDIGO guidelines also support the use of CGM in patients with CKD. They suggest using CGM to calculate GMI in patients with advanced CKD. CGM can also be considered in earlier stages of CKD if there is a clinical concern that the A1C is not reflective of the patient's glycemic control, such as discordance between A1C and SMBG or random glucose, or symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. CGM-derived GMI can be compared to A1C, with the caveat that the relationship between the two may differ over time. Table 2 depicts the advantages and disadvantages of different modalities for glycemic assessment.

### Quantification of the relation between continuous glucose monitoring observation period and the estimation error in assessing long-term glucose regulation [^115mQu5D]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The integration of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) into clinical practice has rapidly emerged in the last decade, changing the management and care of patients with diabetes. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for assessing average long-term blood glucose over 2–3 months.CGM can estimate HbA1c values using the glucose management indicator (GMI) but also provides more detailed information, for example, on time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and glycemic variability (GV). These metrics can be used by patients and clinicians to substantiate their treatment decisions.

In this respect, it is relevant to understand how varying lengths of CGM duration reflect long-term glucose regulation in order to determine what is the minimum length of CGM measurements to gain a reliable estimation. One has to take into account that, for practical limitations such as data collection and resource use, it is desirable to opt for the shortest time interval that reliably enough reflects long-term glucose regulation.

Several studies have previously addressed this issue, and the current recommendation from the 2019 Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) states that the CGM measurement duration should be at least 14 days with CGM data available for at least 70% of the time. Previous studies have demonstrated a high correlation (R²) between CGM-derived metrics calculated within this period and those calculated over a 3-month period. However, correlation-based methods are somewhat difficult to translate into clinical applicability. Later studies showed that 15 days of data are required for an absolute SD of 5% around TIR, or that 18 days of data needs to be used to ensure a CI of 5% around TIR. More recently, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) has been applied for this issue, and it was shown that the mean glucose after 2 weeks reaches the threshold of 5% MAPE, meaning that the percentage average deviation between the estimated value and actual values was 5%. MAPE is related to the mean absolute error (MAE). Whereas MAPE provides the percentage error, the MAE reflects the average absolute magnitude of errors associated with long-term estimations. Thus, MAE may offer an easier way to interpret the reliability of changes in CGM-derived metrics by considering the MAE-based determination of accuracy, with the general rule of thumb that the MAE value should be smaller than the changes in CGM-derived metrics that one aims to reliably detect.

4.1.3 Limitations of

Clinical states associated with altered rates of hemoglobin turnover or erythrocyte survival will affect HbA1c measurements and therefore clinical utility (Table 1). As HbA1c directly reflects average glucose levels, highly variable glucose levels with fluctuating hypo‐ and hyperglycemia can result in the same HbA1c measurement as an individual with stable glucose levels. This is important as glycemic variability predicts severe hypoglycemia, and there is a growing body of evidence that glycemic variability is an independent risk factor for short ‐ and long‐term complications. Arguably, CGM, by virtue of providing metrics for both average glucose, glucose out of target range and glycemic variability, as well as having a very high correlation with HbA1c, provides a better reflection of overall glycemia. CGM offers an alternative proxy for HbA1c [the Glucose Management Index (GMI)], however, there is some discordance between GMI and laboratory HbA1c, and hence, the term "estimated" HbA1c should be avoided. Evidence supports the association of diabetes complications and CGM derived measures, particularly time in range. However as widespread CGM uptake has been a more recent phenomenon, it will take time for large registry data to definitively connect CGM metrics with the development of micro‐ and macrovascular complications. However, where CGM data are not available, evaluation of fructosamine and/or 1,5‐anhydroglucitol (1,5‐AG) may be the only alternative when HbA1c is not truly reflective of glycemia (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Clinical states affecting erythrocyte turnover and their effects on HbA1c

Fructosamine is the generic term for plasma protein ketoamines or 1‐amino‐1‐deoxy‐D‐fructose, and more specifically is the measurement of the total stable irreversible serum glycated proteins at any given time. The half‐life of serum proteins is significantly shorter than that of erythrocytes, and the degree of glycation is therefore more reflective of shorter‐term alterations in plasma glucose concentrations that is estimated to be 2–3 weeks, which is consistent with the half‐life of albumin (20 days) which comprises 80% of total serum proteins.1,5‐AG has been proposed in the assessment of glycemic variability. Low 1,5‐AG values are indicative of both high circulating plasma glucose concentration, as well as fluctuations in plasma glucose concentrations (hyperglycemic excursions). 1,5‐AG concentration reflects plasma glucose concentrations over the preceding 2–14 days.

### Glucose alarms approach with flash glucose monitoring system: a narrative review of clinical benefits [^115hSmX4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Attaining an adequate glycemic control in people with diabetes has been associated with a better prognosis and with a reduction in the risk of developing long-term microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications. Classically the determination of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels has been used for assessing glycemic control, but HbA1c cannot detect the short-term variations of glucose levels, the time the subject is in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, including asymptomatic or severe hypoglycemic events, or glycemic variability. Self-monitoring of blood glucose provides an accurate measure of capillary glucose concentrations, and it has been shown that the higher the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) measurements, the better the HbA1c. However, self-monitoring of blood glucose does not sufficiently detect glycemic variability and trends, especially during the night or in case of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and it can be inconvenient, painful and difficult to maintain long-term treatment.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) measures real-time interstitial glucose levels, enabling early detection of hypo- and hyperglycemia and improves glycemic control. CGM provides information about metrics that are relevant to glucose control, such as time in range (TIR — time spend with glucose values between 70 and 180 mg/dL), time above range (TAR — time spend with glucose values higher than 180 mg/dL) and time below range (TBR — time spend with glucose values lower than 70 mg/dL), coefficient of variation, and glucose monitoring index (GMI). Briefly, TIR refers to the amount of time you spend in the target blood glucose range and is marker for risk of chronic complications; coefficient of variation is calculated as the standard deviation of sensor glucose values during the observation period divided by the mean of sensor glucose values in the same observation period and reflects glucose variability. GMI is an estimate of the laboratory HbA1c level based on the average glucose measured via CGM. Lastly, time in tight range (TITR) is defined as the percentage of time spent in the target glucose range of 70–140 mg/dL, and represents a promising novel CGM glycemic metric.

Special considerations in patients with CKD

Glucose variability may be higher in patients with CKD. Postprandial hyperglycemia can occur due to lack of kidneys' filtration and clearance of glucose. Fasting hypoglycemia can occur due to the lack of kidney gluconeogenesis and prolonged half-life of endogenous insulin and glucose-lowering medications. Biomarkers of average glycemia, including A1C and glycated proteins, might also not be reliable in advanced CKD due to limitations discussed previously. CGM can provide valuable insights into glucose patterns and glycemic control that might not otherwise be available. The discrepancy between GMI and laboratory-measured A1C can also be valuable in making treatment decisions, including intensifying and de-escalation of glucose-lowering medications. Figure 1 shows the CGM profile of a person without diabetes (Fig. 1 A) and five patients with end-stage kidney disease (Fig. 1 B–F). The glucose time-in-range provides invaluable information, not fully captured by either A1C or GMI. Detailed daily glucose data, a food diary, and glucose-lowering medication dosage provide further information to guide management (Fig. 2). Rigorous studies of patients with advanced CKD are needed to determine if CGM should replace the measurement of plasma biomarkers to assess glycemic control.

Time in range results from continuous glucose monitoring in patients with chronic kidney disease. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 6 individuals, including one person without diabetes (A) and five persons with diabetes and end-stage kidney disease (B – F), are presented. The CGM data are categorized as time-in-range, based on consensus recommendations. Glucose management indicator (GMI) is calculated from the average glucose results for each person, and lab-measured A1C is also presented. Note that significant variability in the glucose time-in-range is present within the same range of A1Cs (A – D and E, F). For example, for person E with an A1C of 8.4%, the GMI is 6.9%, and the CGM time-in-range is within acceptable limits. However, for person F, the A1C is 8.1%, GMI is 9.2%, and the CGM time-in-range is unacceptably high

### How to take action beyond ambulatory glucose profile: latin American expert recommendations on CGM data interpretation [^112KSWQU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This expert consensus provides a standardized methodology for interpreting continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to optimize diabetes management. It aims to help healthcare professionals recognize glycemic patterns and apply targeted interventions based on real-time glucose metrics.

Methods

A systematic literature review informed expert panel discussions. Specialists from Latin America assessed CGM interpretation challenges, reviewed key metrics, and reached consensus through an anonymous voting process. The recommendations align with international guidelines while addressing regional limitations in technology access and healthcare infrastructure.

Results

Reliable CGM data interpretation requires at least 70% sensor use over 14 days. The Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) report serves as the primary tool, offering essential metrics such as time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR), time above range (TAR), coefficient of variation (CV), and glucose management indicator (GMI). Identifying hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glucose variability allows for personalized treatment adjustments. The panel adopted international glycemic targets, adapting them to Latin American settings. The time in tight range (TITR) was considered but not included due to limited supporting evidence and regional barriers to advanced CGM technology.

Conclusions

Standardized CGM interpretation improves glycemic control and treatment decisions. These recommendations provide a structured approach to diabetes care, aiming to enhance clinical outcomes and address healthcare disparities in Latin America.

### Level of agreement and correlation between the estimated hemoglobin A1c results derived by continuous or conventional glucose monitoring systems compared with the point-of-care or laboratory-based measurements: an observational study [^1133JFgm]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

High HbA1c levels are seen in 50–60% of diabetic patients, indicating that they either are not receiving proper care or are not adhering to their treatment regimen. Furthermore, delayed therapeutic escalation is the primary cause of diabetes management failure after treatment intensification. Therefore, addressing inadequate glycemic control is recognized as a significant issue in successful diabetes care.

Nowadays, for most patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) globally, self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) has become an essential component of modern diabetic therapy to achieve the target level of glycemic control and to prevent hypoglycemia. However, SMBG just gives snapshots of blood glucose concentrations. Furthermore, many patients may not conduct frequent SMBG as required because of pain and inconvenience. Patients now have an alternative to conventional SMBG in the form of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems that can be intermittently scanned (isCGMS), intermittently viewed (ivCGMS), or used in real time (rtCGMS). The CGM system can record glucose concentrations in interstitial fluid subcutaneously by sensors based on enzymatic amperometric electrodes and provide many glycemic data, glucose trends, and expected future glycemic status, especially for T1DM patients. Furthermore, the CGM technique eliminates the restrictions of the present method of monitoring glucose levels, which involves frequent and painful finger pricks. In Saudi Arabia, the commercially available CGMS is the FreeStyle Libre ® (Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc.) flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system.

Both SMBG and CGM have significant evidence supporting their efficacy in promoting better long-term glycemic control. However, previous reports have shown a discordance between the glucose monitoring index (GMI) derived by isCGM and estimated average glucose (eAG) derived by conventional SMBG system with the standard laboratory HbA1c. The potential discrepancies between laboratory and GMI derived by CGM devices are caused by estimated HbA1c being calculated through the average glucose and correlated with time in range, which is the relative time spent in a range of normal blood glucose. Moreover, studies showed that POCT values of HbA1c can be varied from the laboratory HbA1c. Thus, the potential disagreement/discrepancies between HbA1c and estimated HbA1c may be the source of therapeutic errors. As CGM usage grows, it is critical to comprehend and utilize its data and biomarkers.

### Level of agreement and correlation between the estimated hemoglobin A1c results derived by continuous or conventional glucose monitoring systems compared with the point-of-care or laboratory-based measurements: an observational study [^112F7WLs]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

HbA1c is used to guide blood glucose management plans and is an important biomarker of the risk of developing diabetic complications. Because of the high level of agreement between the GMI measured by the isCGM or eAG measured by the conventional SMBG systems with the POCT and the standard laboratory test, as well as the advantages of isCGM over the other methods of glucose monitoring, we believe that estimated HbA1c and other parameters provided by the isCGM provide more personalized detailed glycemic data for a better diabetes care management plan, especially with uncontrolled patients or on intensive insulin therapy. Moreover, POCT-HbA1c measurements showed a high level of agreement and correlation with the standard laboratory test. Therefore, POCT-HbA1c is a potential method for diabetes screening and monitoring in daily clinic visits, especially when a rapid result is needed. However, for the initial diagnosis of DM, HbA1c level measured using the standard laboratory method is still recommended.

### Can HbA1c alone Be safely used to guide insulin therapy in African youth with type 1 diabetes? [^113AbKYD]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

Understanding the relationship between HbA1c and MBG is important for the clinical management of patients with diabetes. To our knowledge, the current data assessment is the first to compare the relationship between HbA1c and MBG derived from CGM in young Black African patients with type 1 diabetes with other reference populations. The East African patients are a relatively genetically homogenous group whereas the reference populations are primarily from the US and contained large numbers of patients of non-Hispanic White European heritage (W). Even African heritage (AH) populations and other groups in the US may be genetically heterogenous. We found that for HbA1c levels over 7% (53 mmol/mol), CGM MBG was considerably lower at any given level of HbA1c for the African patients compared to the other populations. It has been previously reported that AH populations living in the US also have lower MBG at any given level of HbA1c than W patients. Our current study suggests that reliance on widely used reference standards such as ADAG and GMI for the relationship of HbA1c vs MBG would lead to overestimation of actual MBG for the African patients. Data from the current study do not allow us to propose a mechanism for the observed disparity of HbA1c between ethnic groups. However, others have discussed potential mechanism/s for this observation though none have been established conclusively.

### Diabetes technology: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1118MHTZ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes technology — observational and real‑world data indicate that in type 1 diabetes, intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) use is associated with improvement in A1C, TIR (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L]), and hypoglycemia. Reductions in acute complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia or diabetes‑related coma, and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, have been observed in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with some effects persisting even after 2 years of CGM initiation. In adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin or noninsulin therapy, retrospective review beginning 6 months after isCGM initiation showed improved outcomes, and among noninsulin‑using adults with type 2 diabetes, continued isCGM use reduced A1C and glucose management indicator (GMI), increased TIR, and reduced TAR (> 180 mg/dL). Self‑reported treatment satisfaction generally increased with isCGM, including in youth with type 1 diabetes where a slight increase in A1C and weight occurred but user satisfaction was high. In adults with insulin‑treated type 1 or type 2 diabetes, retrospective real‑time CGM (rtCGM) data showed significantly lower A1C and reduced emergency visits or hospitalizations for hypoglycemia, without significant reductions in overall emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or hyperglycemia.

Introduction

Laboratory glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a standard metric for the assessment of glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, there are several limitations in the use of laboratory HbA1c for assessing glycemic control. Laboratory HbA1c could not assess hypoglycemia or glycemic variability (GV) and is easily affected by certain conditions such as renal failure, hemoglobinopathy and chronic liver disease. Thus, estimating glycemic control by laboratory HbA1c alone may not reveal a thorough characterization of glycemic exposure for some patients, especially those with large blood glucose fluctuations in the short term and those with frequent exposure to hypoglycemia such as patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D).

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become a useful tool for assessing blood glucose levels in the last few years. It can provide more detailed and comprehensive blood glucose information via numerous data. The glucose metrics derived from CGM data partially compensate for the limitations of laboratory HbA1c. Recently, 15 of these metrics have been recommended as key metrics by international guidelines and consensuses. – The glucose monitoring index (GMI), derived from CGM mean glucose and previously named as estimated A1C, is one of them.

### Time in range, as measured by continuous glucose monitor, as a predictor of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^111wtfHM]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) is the primary tool for monitoring long-term glycemic control and assessing the risk of diabetes-related complications. However, A1c has several limitations. A1c is affected by factors such as age, race/ethnicity, hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemia, recent blood transfusion, chronic kidney disease, and pregnancy, resulting in discrepancies between measured A1c and true glycemic control. Furthermore, A1c fails to provide information about extremes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, glucose trends, and glycemic variability. Intermittent self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) is not influenced by conditions affecting red blood cell turnover and provides information beyond A1c; however, it is inconvenient and unpopular among patients of all age groups.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are increasingly popular, affordable, reliable in improving A1c, and overcome many of the limitations with A1c, and SMBG and CGM-derived metrics are now incorporated into the management of patients with diabetes.CGM devices measure interstitial fluid glucose every 1–5 min and provide several metrics. Mean glucose from CGM has also been used to calculate glucose management indicator (GMI), also known as 'estimated A1C'. Time in range (TIR) is another metric, defined as the percentage of time glucose between 70 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L). Over the last few years, TIR has become popular as a surrogate marker of glycemic control, which also correlates with A1c. International consensus recommends TIR of 70% to align with A1c of ~7%, with a 0.5% decline in A1c per 10% increase in TIR. Furthermore, a 5% increase in TIR was associated with significant clinical benefits among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

5.4 Issues surrounding standardisation ofvalues

Although a consensus was formed around standardising the reporting format of summarised CGM data, as a description of the AGP, the standardisation of CGM glucose measurements themselves has not yet reached this point. Analytical performance of CGM systems differs not only between manufacturers but also between individual sensors of the same system and sometimes even within the same person.

Several issues arise with glucose measurements in the interstitial compartment, which has a different matrix and different flow dynamics, including differences in rates of change of glucose. This means changes in interstitial fluid glucose often lag behind those of blood glucose by up to 10–15 min. The IFCC Scientific Division Working Group on continuous glucose monitoring was established with the aim to standardise CGM to a higher‐order standard or a Primary Reference Measurement Procedure (PRMP) and to provide recommendations for reporting the general study design, CGM system use, the comparator measurement approach, testing procedures and data analysis/statistical performance evaluation. It is no surprise that standardising CGM is not an easy task, as glucose is not a stable parameter, and different CGM and different statistical approaches can lead to different outcomes and thus ultimately influence the discordance between GMI and HbA 1c.

6.2.3 Key metrics of the standardised CGM report

The wealth of data generated by the CGM system provides great convenience for comprehensively evaluating the quality of glucose control in diabetes. The International Consensus on Use of CGM recommended 14 parameters as the core CGM metrics in standardised reports. Of them, 10 metrics including TIR, Time Above Range, and Time Below Range (TBR) have great value for clinical evaluation of glucose control.TIR refers to the time (expressed in minutes) or the percentage (expressed in %) of glucose within the target range (usually 3.9–10.0 mmol/L in non‐gestational adults) within 24 h. Currently, the recommended target for TIR control in most patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is > 70%, with a TBR (< 3.9 mmol/L) of < 4% and a TBR (< 3.0 mmol/L) of < 1%, and the individualisation of glycaemic targets should be emphasised. The CV of glucose levels, defined as (SD/mean glucose) × 100%, is recommended as the core parameter for assessing glycaemic variability. The main advantage of CV lies in its simplicity and its independence of mean glucose. There is evidence that a CV of > 33% was related to excess risk of hypoglycaemia in a Chinese population with diabetes. Mean glucose is an important measure reflecting the overall exposure to hyperglycaemia, which can be converted to an estimated HbA1c using a population‐based formula. To reduce the confusion for clinicians and patients when the estimated HbA1c does not match with the laboratory‐measured HbA1c, the term 'glucose management indicator' (GMI) is now used to replace 'estimated HbA1c'. From a clinical perspective, the potential discordance between GMI and HbA1c could help inform diabetes management. For instance, a greater difference between HbA1c and GMI was associated with higher risk of hypoglycaemia in a non‐White population.

6.3 CGM metrics and diabetes‐related outcomes

Previous observational studies reported that TIR was significantly associated with microvascular complications, a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease, neonatal outcomes, and all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, suggesting that TIR can be a useful indicator for assessing glucose control. In a recent prospective study conducted in Chinese patients with seemingly well‐controlled type 2 diabetes, CV was reported to be significantly linked to all‐cause mortality.

### Usefulness of CGM-derived metric, the glucose management indicator, to assess glycemic control in non-white individuals with diabetes [^113jZNjk]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between the glucose management indicator (GMI) and HbA 1c in non-White individuals with diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of continuous glucose monitoring metrics in individuals with diabetes divided by race into non-White and White cohorts.

Results

We evaluated 316 individuals (non-White n = 68; White n = 248). Although GMI was not different (7.6 vs. 7.7; P = not significant) between the cohorts, HbA 1c was higher in the non-White cohort (8.7% vs. 8.1%; P = 0.004). HbA 1c higher than GMI by ≥ 0.5% was more frequently observed in the non-White cohort (90% vs. 75%; P = 0.02). In the non-White cohort only, duration of hypoglycemia was longer among those with HbA 1c higher than GMI by ≥ 0.5% compared with those with HbA 1c and GMI within 0.5%.

Conclusions

A differential relationship between HbA 1c and GMI in non-White versus White individuals with diabetes was observed. In non-White individuals, a greater difference between HbA 1c and GMI was associated with higher risk of hypoglycemia.

### Impacts of glycemic variability on the relationship between glucose management indicator from iPro2 and laboratory hemoglobin A1c in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^114Ejkej]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. In our study, GMI was calculated based on a median of 13 days CGM data in our study, which was shorter than those in previous studies, though 10–14 days CGM data was considered sufficient to estimate the CGM metrics for a 3-month period. In addition, the patients enrolled in this study were Chinese adult patients with T1D and our results may not be applicable to patients from other ethnic groups. Finally, similar to other sensors, iPro ™ 2 has a limited range of reliable measurements between 2.2 mmol/L and 22.2 mmol/L and has a lag time in glucose values compared with the venous measured values. Therefore, CGM data could be less precise in patients with high glycemic variability, which might result in underestimation of the influence of GV on the GMI.

In conclusion, we found discrepancies between GMI and laboratory HbA1c in patients with T1D, especially in those with moderate or high HGI. We provided validation of the GMI formula using the iPro ™ 2 sensor in Chinese adult patients with T1D and confirmed that the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c was influenced by GV. Thus, when applying the GMI in the management of patients with T1D, the impacts of HGI and GV should be considered.

Initiation of device use — continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and blood glucose monitoring (BGM) should be considered from diagnosis requiring insulin, with early CGM and AID initiation supported by outcomes data; an open-label randomized trial in youth found that initiation of an AID system within 121 days from diagnosis showed 10% higher time in range (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L]) and lower A1C at 12 months versus usual care, and broader diabetes technology use increases the number achieving an A1C < 7%; interruption of CGM access is associated with worse outcomes, so consistent access is important.

### Managing discordance between hbAand glucose management indicator [^113HMyxZ]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The huge number of data points that are generated from CGM has led to a plethora of different approaches in interpreting and applying that data for diabetes management. The ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) is the whole of the data generated, and this is further broken down to metrics with target values such as: number of days CGM device is worn, percentage of time CGM device is active, mean glucose, time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), time below range (TBR) and glucose variability.

Whilst these different metrics all give the user information on different aspects of glycaemia, the metric of interest in this article is the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) which is a measure that converts the mean glucose values, obtained from CGM, into an estimate of HbA 1c.

Discussion

CGM indicators such as GMI and GV, as an adjunct to laboratory HbA1c, are beneficial for clinicians and individuals with diabetes to make personalized management decisions. In this study, we observed a discrepancy between GMI (based on iPro ™ 2 system with SOF sensor) and laboratory HbA1c in Chinese adult patients with T1D, especially in those with moderate or high HGI. Moreover, we validated the GMI formula using the iPro ™ 2 system with SOF sensor in this population and found that the linear relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c was influenced by GV, as assessed by SD and MAGE.

The percentage of patients with absolute HGI 0 to < 0.1% was 21% in this study, which was comparable with that reported in previous studies using the other three sensors (ranging from 19% to 20%), while the percentage of patients with 0.7% and higher deviation was higher in this study than those using the other three glucose sensors. There are several possible reasons. First, the wearing time of the sensor was different across the studies [a median of 66 days in Dexcom sensor,3 months in Guardian 3 and Navigator II, and a median of 13 days (91.55% data/per week) in our study]. However, we consider the wearing time of the sensor comparable among the four studies because it has been confirmed that 14 days of CGM data was able to provide a good estimation of glucose metrics for a 3-month period, Second, instrumental bias might also contribute to deviation. Although all four sensors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, it should be borne in mind that the accuracy, sensor life time, and calibration requirement can be varied. Third, the study population included in these studies was different. The participants in our study were Chinese adult patients with T1D, whereas the cohort used to derive the regression formula for GMI comprised both patients with T1D and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Discordance between glycated hemoglobin A1c and the glucose management indicator in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112HCwmT]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assessment of glucose exposure via glycated hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) has limitations for interpretation in individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The glucose management indicator (GMI) derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data could be an alternative. However, the concordance between HbA 1 c measured in laboratory and GMI (HbA 1 c-GMI) is uncertain in individuals with CKD. The purpose of this study is to analyze this discrepancy.

Material and Method

We performed a multicentric, retrospective, observational study. A group of individuals with diabetes and CKD (n = 170) was compared with a group of individuals with diabetes without CKD (n = 185). All individuals used an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM). A comparison of 14-day and 90-day glucose data recorded by the isCGM was performed to calculate GMI and the discordance between lab HbA 1 c and GMI was analyzed by a Bland-Altman method and linear regression.

Results

HbA 1 c-GMI discordance was significantly higher in the CKD group versus without CKD group (0.78 ± 0.57 [0.66–0.90] vs 0.59 ± 0.44 [0.50–0.66]%, P < .005). An absolute difference > 0.5% was found in 68.2% of individuals with CKD versus 42.2% of individuals without CKD. We suggest a new specific formula to estimate HbA 1 c from the linear regression between HbA 1 c and mean glucose CGM, namely CKD-GMI = 0.0261 × 90-day mean glucose (mg/L) + 3.5579 (r² = 0.59).

Conclusions

HbA1c-GMI discordance is frequent and usually in favor of an HbA1c level higher than the GMI value, which can lead to errors in changes in glucose-lowering therapy, especially for individuals with CKD. This latter population should benefit from the CGM to measure their glucose exposure more precisely.

### Novel indicator of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and shortened erythrocyte lifespan: a multicenter cross-sectional analysis [^114kfPsJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, without regard to age or sex of the individual; and it is projected that 1.31 billion people will be living with DM by 2050. Vascular complications that encompass the macrovascular and microvascular systems are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. The pathogenesis of DM and its complications are complex, and primarily influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Early studies have revealed variations in susceptibility to diabetic complications among patients with similar levels of diabetic glycemic control, clinical characteristics, and management.

Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), reflecting blood glucose control over the previous three months, plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of DM. However, it has been observed that individuals with comparable glycemic control can exhibit significant variations in HbA1c values. Therefore, relying solely on HbA1c to establish a diagnosis of DM or to predict the risk of complications is not appropriate for all populations. Currently, many studies combine multiple biomarkers to improve the accuracy of disease prediction and assessment. In 2022 Maran et al. proposed a novel approach to assess glycosylation levels by calculating the ratio of the glycemic management index (GMI) to actual HbA1c, where GMI was the predicted HbA1c level based on average blood glucose values obtained by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); and these authors demonstrated that in a type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) population at similar glucose levels, patients with a rapid glycation phenotype (i.e. a GMI/HbA1c < 0.9) have an increased accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) in their skin that is strongly associated with the development of complications.

Continuous glucose monitoring — characteristics and benefits note that CGM "measures interstitial glucose", and in people with type 1 diabetes, "frequency of sensor use is an important predictor of A1C lowering for all age-groups", while with isCGM "the frequency of scanning… is also correlated with improved outcomes". Few real-time systems need calibration, and "CGM systems are generally nonadjunctive, meaning they do not require BGM confirmation for treatment decisions… except in certain clinical situations". Randomized controlled trials with rtCGM "have largely been positive" for reducing A1C and/or hypoglycemia, with "The primary outcome… met and showed benefit in adults of all ages, including seniors", and pediatric data indicate rtCGM in young children "reduced hypoglycemia".

A measurement duration of 14 days resulted in 89% of subjects being below a hypothetical TBR MAE threshold of 2% and 56% of subjects being below a TBR MAE threshold of 1% (figure 1B). When 50% of the population needed to be below the TBR MAE threshold of 0.5%, 39 days of measurement would be required, and to be below the TBR MAE threshold of 1%, 11 days of measurement would be required. When 90% of subjects must be below the hypothetical TBR MAE threshold of 1%, 51 days of measurement would be required.

A measurement duration of 14 days resulted in 51% of subjects being below a hypothetical GMI MAE threshold of 0.2% (2 mmol/mol) and 3% of subjects being below a GMI MAE threshold of 0.1% (1 mmol/mol) (figure 1C). A measurement duration of 22 days results in all subjects being below the GMI MAE threshold of 0.5% (5 mmol/mol). When it is hypothetically desired that 50% of the population needed to be below the GMI MAE threshold of 0.2% (2 mmol/mol), 13 days of measurement would be required. When 90% of subjects must be below the GMI MAE threshold of 0.2% (2 mmol/mol), 40 days of measurement would be required.

A measurement duration of 14 days resulted in 36% of subjects being below a hypothetical GV MAE threshold of 2% and 100% of subjects being below a GV MAE threshold of 5% (figure 1D). No subjects were below a GV MAE threshold of 1% with a measurement duration of 14 days. When it is hypothetically desired that 50% of the population needed to be below the GV MAE threshold of 2%, 17 days of measurement would be required. When 90% of subjects must be below the GV MAE threshold of 2%, 33 days of measurement would be required.

### Glycemic metrics derived from intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring [^112PKZDJ]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucose data from intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) is a combination of scanned and imported glucose values. The present knowledge of glycemic metrics originate mostly from glucose data from real-time CGM sampled every five minutes with a lack of information derived from isCGM.

Methods

Glucose data obtained with isCGM and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained from 169 patients with type 1 diabetes. Sixty-one patients had two observations with an interval of more than three months.

Results

The best regression line of HbA1c against mean glucose was observed from 60days prior to HbA 1c measurement as compared to 14, 30, and 90days. The difference between HbA1c and estimated HbA1c (= glucose management indicator [GMI]) first observed correlated with the second observation (R² 0.61, P < .001). Time in range (TIR, glucose between 3.9 and 10mmol/L) was significantly related to GMI (R2 0.87, P < .001). A TIR of 70% corresponded to a GMI of 6.8% (95% confidence interval, 6.3–7.4). The fraction of patients with the optimal combination of TIR > 70% and time below range (TBR) < 4% was 3.6%. The fraction of patients with TBR > 4% was four times higher for those with high glycemic variability (coefficient of variation [CV] > 36%) than for those with lower CV.

Conclusion

The individual difference between HbA1c and GMI was reproducible. High glycemic variability was related to increased TBR. A combination of TIR and TBR is suggested as a new composite quality indicator.

Connected insulin pens and insulin pen caps — glycemic outcomes and adherence associations are summarized as follows: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) in people with type 1 diabetes, use of an insulin pen cap was associated with improved glycemic outcomes at 6 weeks with an increase in time in range (TIR) and decrease in glucose management indicator (GMI) and time above range (TAR). A systematic review of connected insulin pens or pen caps showed improvement of glucose outcomes, including A1C reduction, TIR increase, or hypoglycemia reduction. Real-world multinational data comprising 3,954 adults with diabetes using a connected pen and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) validated that treatment engagement with a connected insulin pen is positively associated with glycemic outcomes, and missing as little as two basal doses or four insulin bolus doses over a 14-day period would be associated with a clinically relevant decrease in TIR of 5%.

### HbA1c overestimates the glucose management indicator: a pilot study in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, and anemia using isCGM [^115UyH7a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 537 million people will be living with type 2 diabetes in the world by 2021 and 784 million by 2045. Up to a quarter of them live with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a prevalence that is increasing due to the improvement in life expectancy. It is, therefore, essential to achieve timely glycemic control that has an impact on mortality and cardiorenal outcomes. American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommend evaluating glycated hemoglobin at least twice a year in controlled patients, and at least four times a year in noncontrolled patients. However, there are multiple metabolic interactions between CKD and diabetes; thus, the interpretation of good control is not equivalent to that in patients without CKD. These include impaired glucose clearance by muscle due to uremia, decreased insulin clearance by a damaged kidney, persistence of a constant proinflammatory state, and overproduction of counterregulatory hormones.

In terms of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), there are multiple variables that make its interpretation difficult: race, the presence of anemia, the frequent use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and the reduction in the half-life of erythrocytes due to uremia make the value of HbA1c at follow-up biased or imprecise. Therefore, other biomarkers such as glycated albumin and fructosamine have been proposed; however, they lack precision and validation studies at the population level.

Diabetes technology and specifically continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems may be useful to overcome these difficulties. Multiple studies have supported the use of CGM in the population with diabetes. Both intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) and real-time continuous glucose monitoring allow the calculation of internationally accepted metrics to assess glycemic control, such as the glucose management indicator (GMI) from interstitial glucose measurements, with the advantage that they are not affected by the metabolic alterations or deterioration of glomerular rate filtration. The GMI is based on the glucose average to give a value analogous to HbA1c and provides information for a more personalized diabetes management plan, which may be useful in patients with renal failure or anemia in whom there may be discrepancies between the HbA1c result and the patient's actual mean blood glucose.

### Changes in A1c versus GMI across glycemic categories in clinical trials of type 1 diabetes [^113f64pj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

The glucose management indicator (GMI) is an estimated A1C derived from sensor glucose. Though it is being used to approximate A1C in clinical trials, there is no data on direction and magnitude of change in GMI vs A1C after an intervention.

Objective

To evaluate the magnitude and direction of changes in A1C compared to GMI across different baseline glycemic categories in type 1 diabetes (T1D) clinical trials.

Methods

Baseline and 3-month central lab measured A1C and estimated GMI from sensor glucose were collected from T1D clinical trials (DCLP3, DCLP5, and WISDM), encompassing children, adolescents, adults, and older adults. Magnitude and direction of changes (baseline- 3 months) in A1C versus GMI were compared overall across the studies and by stratified baseline A1C (< 7%, 7–9%, > 9%).

Results

A modest correlation was found between changes in A1C and GMI (r = 0.34). Participants with baseline A1C > 9% had larger reductions in A1C compared to GMI [-1.2 (-2.1 to -0.6) vs. -0.6 (-0.94 to 0), p < 0.01]. Those with baseline A1C between 7–9% showed a greater decline in A1C than GMI [-0.4 (-0.9 to -0.1) vs. -0.12 (-0.49 to 0.21), p < 0.01]. No significant difference was observed for baseline A1C < 7%.

Conclusions

Change in GMI is influenced by the baseline A1C of the participants and it underestimates the true change in A1C. Use of GMI as an endpoint in clinical trials may not reliably capture efficacy of an intervention in T1D trials or real-world studies.

### Predicting glycated hemoglobin through continuous glucose monitoring in real-life conditions: improved estimation methods [^115AS4Ez]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) assays are common practice to judge long-term glycemic control in diabetes care, and calibration techniques have been internationally standardized and refined over the years to assess the precision and accuracy of commercial HbA1c measurement methods. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM), in turn, allows to collect lots of glucose data, which can be used to estimate HbA1c without resorting to laboratory tests.

The evaluation of estimated HbA1c from CGM, also known as eA1C or glucose management indicator (GMI), and its relationships with average glucose values were investigated in a number of studies.- A good agreement between eA1C/GMI and the reference gold standard HbA1c can significantly help clinicians in achieving better disease monitoring and control and healthcare managers in lowering overall healthcare costs. However, as discrepancies exist between predicted and assay values of HbA1c, improvements in the mathematical methods can reduce differences and allow users to gain more confidence in the estimations themselves.

Moreover, CGM introduces other sources of uncertainty when carried out in real-life situationsbecause the collection of glucose values performed at home is frequently subject to device misuse and wrong patient behavior, thus resulting in missing and/or incorrect sensor datathat may affect estimation quality. The " REAl-Life glucoSe Monitoring in Type 1 Diabetes " (REALISM-T1D) observational study is aimed at evaluating the advantages that can be obtained by adopting CGM in real-life conditions for adult patients affected by type-1 diabetes. We have focused on the improvement of CGM-based estimation methods, with the aim of obtaining better predicted values for HbA1c.

A popular eA1C estimation method proposed by Leowis based on 3 steps (Figure 1). First the area under curve (AUC) is evaluated by integration of the curve of interstitial glucose (IG) sensor values over time. Then AUC is used to compute the mean interstitial glucose (MIG) value and finally a mapping function (the regression equation from the ADAG studyor other equations,-) derives eA1C from MIG. Leow's methoddid not focus on the collection, filtering, and management of missing sensor data. Moreover, AUC was computed without using any weighting function w (t) for CGM samples, though this possibility was mentioned in Leow's paper.

### Evaluation of continuous glucose monitoring-derived person-specific HbA1c in the presence and absence of complications in type 1 diabetes [^113AcLd5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the accuracy of a novel kinetic model at predicting HbA1c in a real-world setting and to understand and explore the role of diabetes complications in altering the glucose-HbA1c relationship and the mechanisms involved.

Materials and Methods

Deidentified HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring values were collected from 93 individuals with type 1 diabetes. Person-specific kinetic variables were used, including red blood cell (RBC) glucose uptake and lifespan, to characterize the relationship between glucose levels and HbA1c. The resulting calculated HbA1c (cHbA1c) was compared with glucose management indicator (GMI) for prospective agreement with laboratory HbA1c.

Results

The cohort (42 men and 51 women) had a median age (IQR) of 61 (43, 72) years and a diabetes duration of 21 (10, 33) years. A total of 24459days of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were available and 357 laboratory HbA1c were used to assess the average glucose-HbA1c relationship. cHbA1c had a superior correlation with laboratory HbA1c compared with GMI with a mean absolute deviation of 1.7 and 6.7mmol/mol, r² = 0.85 and 0.44, respectively. The fraction within 10% of absolute relative deviation from laboratory HbA1c was 93% for cHbA1c and 63% for GMI. Macrovascular disease had no effect on the model's accuracy, whereas microvascular complications resulted in a trend towards higher HbA1c, secondary to increased RBC glucose uptake.

Conclusions

cHbA1c, which takes into account RBC glucose uptake and lifespan, accurately reflects laboratory HbA1c in a real-world setting and can aid in the management of individuals with diabetes.

### Time in range-A1c hemoglobin relationship in continuous glucose monitoring of type 1 diabetes: a real-world study [^1156QLVT]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

In fact, a 0.5% decrease in A1C, from 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) to 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), means an improvement of the predicted TIR percentage from 52.9% to 58.8% for the FGM group and from 60.2% to 65.6% for the rtCGM group. Although the absolute variation is similar (5.9% vs 5.4%), the impact is significantly different in the two situations because of the role played by the corresponding values of β₁ and β₀, which match the same A1C value with higher TIR percentages for the rtCGM group than for FGM. The unavailability of CGM (TIR) data at baseline cannot exclude for sure that this discrepancy might be caused by some bias effect in the study, despite no appreciable differences existing in the two groups concerning anthropometry and therapy. An additional check carried out in the regression analysis by dropping two sensor-sampled data out of three in the rtCGM case (thus simulating a lower sampling rate equal to the FGM sensors) resulted in no appreciable changes in the computed TIR values and consequently in the regression coefficients. Other reasons, possibly deserving more investigations, are differences in sensor technology and patient-induced behavior. Actually, the FGM sensors used in the study are unable to generate alerts and alarms for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, likely requiring more attention and intervention by patients, thus justifying slower reaction times, which ultimately can result in a reduction in the overall time spent in the 70–180 mg/dL range.

### The effect of continuous glucose monitoring in well-controlled type 1 diabetes [^116gwsKx]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this randomized trial, we evaluated the effect of CGM on glycemic control in adults and children with well-controlled type 1 diabetes using conventional blood glucose monitoring, as evidenced by a baseline A1C level < 7.0%. For the primary outcome, the median time per day ≤ 70 mg/dl as measured with CGM was 37 min lower in the CGM group than in the control group after 6 months of intervention. Although the prespecified primary analysis method failed to reach statistical significance, other methods accounting for the skewness of the data had smaller P values, and significant differences between groups were seen with almost all other CGM-measured biochemical hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic outcomes as well as A1C outcomes and outcomes combining A1C and hypoglycemia.

In planning this study, the change in A1C was not selected as the primary outcome measure because we did not anticipate being able to lower A1C levels in the CGM group in view of their exquisite level of control on entry in the study. Indeed, we expected that there might even be small and clinically insignificant increases in A1C values in the CGM group if we were able to reduce the frequency of glucose levels ≤ 70 mg/dl. Instead, the CGM group was able to maintain A1C levels at baseline values with less biochemical hypoglycemia, whereas A1C levels rose over time in the control group. Moreover, all of the other A1C outcomes favored the CGM group over the control group. The increases in A1C in the control group might have been expected because of regression to the mean from the effective floor on the A1C level of ∼6.0% for most patients and from the 6.9% A1C cutoff point required for eligibility as well as the difficulties in maintaining a near-normal A1C level.

CGM Metrics

Recognizing the increase in use of glucose-sensing technologies, we lastly examined documented CGM metrics in emerging adults with type 1 diabetes before the COVID-19 pandemic and at their last assessment. At their last pre-pandemic visit, CGM metrics were available for 24 patients. At the last visit before censure on 25 May 2022, CGM metrics were available for 56 patients (Table 4). As expected, and aligned with laboratory HbA 1c data, estimated HbA 1c (which includes estimated A1c and glucose management indicator, GMI) was significantly lower at last assessment than pre-lockdown assessment (Table 4). Among those for whom CGM metrics were available at the end of the study period (Table 4), time in range (TIR; sensor glucose 3.9–10.0 mmol/L) was higher and time below range (TBR; sensor glucose < 3.9 mmol/L) was lower in emerging adults using rtCGM in comparison to those using isCGM: TIR (%), rtCGM 67.3 ± 13.8, isCGM 48.1 ± 16.6, P < 0.0001; TBR (%), rtCGM 1.6 ± 1.5, isCGM 5.9 ± 5.8, P < 0.01; two-tailed unpaired Student t test.

### An examination of the glucose management indicator in young children with type 1 diabetes [^113XRnsi]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies utilizing glucose data from continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to estimate the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) have not included young children or determined appropriate GMI formulas for young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Methods

We extracted CGM data for 215 children with T1D (0-6years) from a repository. We defined sampling periods ranging from the 3-27days prior to an HbA1c measurement and compared a previously established GMI formula to a young child-specific GMI equation based on the sample's CGM data. We examined associations between HbA1c, GMI values, and other CGM metrics for each sampling period.

Results

The young child-specific GMI formula and the published GMI formula did not evidence significant differences when using 21-27days of CGM data. The young child-specific GMI formula demonstrated higher correlations to laboratory HbA1c when using 18 or fewer days of CGM data. Overall, the GMI estimate and HbA1c values demonstrate a strong relationship in young children with T1D.

Conclusions

Future research studies may consider utilizing the young child-specific GMI formula if the data collection period for CGM values is under 18days. Further, researchers and clinicians may consider changing the default number of days of data used to calculate glycemic metrics in order to maximize validity of CGM-derived metrics.

### Impacts of glycemic variability on the relationship between glucose management indicator from iPro2 and laboratory hemoglobin A1c in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^112DkcSH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover, we found significant discrepancies between the GMI and laboratory HbA1c, with the highest laboratory HbA1c in the high-HGI group, while GMI remained similar among the three groups, suggesting that the discrepancies were independent of GMI levels. This result is consistent with those reported by Hempe et al. who attributed this discrepancy to the individual differences in laboratory HbA1c and suggested using HGI to quantify it. Notably, a few studies reported that there was an association between HGI and diabetic complications in patients with diabetes, with high HGI values having higher incidences of cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, and nephropathy. – These findings as well as our results suggested that HGI should be addressed when assessing glycemic control in patients with T1D.

Furthermore, our study explored the effect of GV on the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c. To our knowledge, the present study was the first study to explore the impact of GV on the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c by using CGM data. First, we validated the linear fitting GMI formula using the iPro ™ 2 sensor in Chinese adult patients with T1D, which also confirmed the linear relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c. Second, in the multivariable linear regression analysis, we found the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, BMI, treatment method, wearing time, interview time, intervention method, and hemoglobin (basic adjustment). However, further adjustment for SD or MAGE, but not CV, attenuated the association between GMI and laboratory HbA1c. This indicates that the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c is partly mediated by GV as assessed with SD and MAGE. Third, we found that the correlation coefficients between GMI and laboratory HbA1c decreased with the quartiles of SD and MAGE ascending. Based on the previously mentioned findings, we proposed that GV should be taken into consideration when applying GMI or HbA1c for the personalized management of diabetes. For example, patients with stable glucose can choose either GMI or laboratory HbA1c for individual management, while those with large glucose fluctuations would need a combination of GMI and laboratory HbA1c to help us set individual goals.

### Age and red blood cell parameters mainly explain the differences between HbA1c and glycemic management indicator among patients with type 1 diabetes using intermittent continuous glucose monitoring [^111MDeZR]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard to assess glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Glucose management indicator (GMI), a metric generated by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), has been proposed as an alternative to HbA1c, but the two values may differ, complicating clinical decision-making. This study aimed to identify the factors that may explain the discrepancy between them.

Methods

Subjects were patients with type 1 diabetes, with one or more HbA1c measurements after starting the use of the Freestyle Libre 2 intermittent CGM, who shared their data with the center on the Libreview platform. The 14-day glucometric reports were retrieved, with the end date coinciding with the date of each HbA1c measurement, and those with sensor use ≥ 70% were selected. Clinical data prior to the start of CGM use, glucometric data from each report, and other simultaneous laboratory measurements with HbA1c were collected.

Results

A total of 646 HbA1c values and their corresponding glucometric reports were obtained from 339 patients. The absolute difference between HbA1c and GMI was < 0.3% in only 38.7% of cases. Univariate analysis showed that the HbA1c-GMI value was associated with age, diabetes duration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and time with glucose between 180 and 250 mg/dL. In a multilevel model, only age and RDW, positively, and MCV, negatively, were correlated to HbA1c-GMI.

Conclusion

The difference between HbA1c and GMI is clinically relevant in a high percentage of cases. Age and easily accessible hematological parameters (MCV and RDW) can help to interpret these differences.

### Improving the clinical value and utility of CGM systems: issues and recommendations: a joint statement of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American diabetes association diabetes technology working group [^1161ykWj]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

The first systems for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) became available over 15 years ago. Many then believed CGM would revolutionize the use of intensive insulin therapy in diabetes; however, progress toward that vision has been gradual. Although increasing, the proportion of individuals using CGM rather than conventional systems for self-monitoring of blood glucose on a daily basis is still low in most parts of the world. Barriers to uptake include cost, measurement reliability (particularly with earlier-generation systems), human factors issues, lack of a standardized format for displaying results, and uncertainty on how best to use CGM data to make therapeutic decisions. This Scientific Statement makes recommendations for systemic improvements in clinical use and regulatory (pre- and postmarketing) handling of CGM devices. The aim is to improve safety and efficacy in order to support the advancement of the technology in achieving its potential to improve quality of life and health outcomes for more people with diabetes.

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^116SnvLb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes care:

For patients using less frequent insulin injections, noninsulin therapies, or medical nutrition therapy and physical therapy alone, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) may be useful as a guide to the success of therapy. (E)
In the "Glucose monitoring" section, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been revised with recommendations. CGM in conjunction with intensive insulin regimens can be a useful tool to lower A1C in selected adults (aged ≥ 25 years) with type 1 diabetes (A). Although the evidence for A1C lowering is less strong in children, teens, and younger adults, CGM may be helpful in these groups. Success correlates with adherence to ongoing use of the device. (C) CGM may be a supplemental tool to SMBG in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or frequent hypoglycemic episodes. (E)
Table 8, now titled "Correlation of A1C with average glucose", has been revised to reflect the correlation from the ADAG (A1c-Derived Average Glucose) study.
The "Glycemic control" section has been extensively revised based on new evidence and includes the following recommendations. Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, for microvascular disease prevention, the A1C goal for nonpregnant adults in general is < 7%. (A) In type 1 and type 2 diabetes, randomized controlled trials of intensive versus standard glycemic control have not shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes during the randomized portion of the trials. Long-term follow-up of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) cohorts suggests that treatment to A1C targets below or around 7% in the years soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in risk of macrovascular disease. Until more evidence becomes available, the general goal of < 7% appears reasonable for many adults for macrovascular risk reduction. (B) Subgroup analyses of clinical trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS and the microvascular evidence from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial suggest a small but incremental benefit in microvascular outcomes with A1C values closer to normal. Therefore, for selected individual patients, providers might reasonably suggest even lower A1C goals than the general goal of < 7%, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Such patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant CVD. (B) Conversely, less stringent A1C goals than the general goal of < 7% may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced micro- or macrovascular complications, and extensive comorbid conditions and those with longstanding diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin. (C) The level of evidence for a medical nutrition therapy recommendation has been changed. Intake of trans fat should be minimized. (B)
The new "Bariatric surgery" section contains the following recommendations. Bariatric surgery should be considered for adults with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² and type 2 diabetes, especially if the diabetes is difficult to control with lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy. (B) Patients with type 2 diabetes who have undergone bariatric surgery need life-long lifestyle support and medical monitoring. (E) Although small trials have shown glycemic benefit of bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI 30–35 kg/m², there is currently insufficient evidence to generally recommend surgery in patients with BMI < 35 kg/m² outside of a research protocol. (E) The long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness, and risks of bariatric surgery in individuals with type 2 diabetes should be studied in well-designed randomized controlled trials with optimal medical and lifestyle therapy as the comparator. (E)
The recommendation for pneumococcal vaccination has been revised. Administer pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to all diabetic patients ≥ 2 years of age. A one-time revaccination is recommended for individuals > 64 years of age previously immunized when they were < 65 years of age if the vaccine was administered > 5 years ago. Other indications for repeat vaccination include nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and other immunocompromised states, such as after transplantation. (C)

### Diabetes technology: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116LegJz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) users — need for blood glucose monitoring (BGM) — states that people with diabetes using CGM must have access to BGM for multiple reasons, including whenever there is suspicion that the CGM is inaccurate, while waiting for warm-up, when there is a disruption in CGM transmission, for calibration (if needed) or if a warning message appears, and when glucose levels are changing rapidly (> 2 mg/dL/min), which could cause a discrepancy between CGM and blood glucose values.

### Diabetes technology: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1162aTMj]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Optimizing blood glucose monitoring (BGM) device use emphasizes that optimal use of BGM devices requires proper review and interpretation of data by both the person with diabetes and the health care professional to ensure that data are used in an effective and timely manner; in people with type 1 diabetes, there is a correlation between greater frequency of checking and lower A1C levels, yet among those who check their blood glucose at least once daily, many report taking no action when results are high or low; the ongoing need for frequency of BGM should be reevaluated at frequent intervals to ensure its effectiveness.

### Association between the GMI / HbA1c ratio and preclinical carotid atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes: impact of the fast-glycator phenotype across age groups [^117JRiKx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, making glycemic control essential for preventing both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), expressed as the percentage of adult hemoglobin that is glycated, reflects the average blood glucose level over the past two to three months. Traditionally, HbA1c has been the gold standard for assessing long-term glycemic control in diabetes, and a wealth of epidemiological evidence supports a good correlation between HbA1c levels and the risk of long-term complications. However, the emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has revealed limitations in HbA1c testing. While CGM provides insights into daily fluctuations of glucose, it can also be used to calculate the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI), representing an estimation of HbA1c calculated exclusively from CGM data and being proposed as a substitute for laboratory-measured HbA1c.

GMI uses the same scale (% or mmol/mol) as HbA1c but usually is based on short-term (14-days) average glucose values, rather than long-term glucose exposure, making evident that estimated HbA1c and laboratory HbA1c values can differ widely. The GMI/HbA1c ratio provides insight into the discrepancy between observed and expected glycation, potentially revealing interindividual differences in hemoglobin glycation rates. This discrepancy could provide additional insights into cardiovascular risk stratification, especially since evidence suggests that individuals with higher levels of glycation may have increased cardiovascular risk and, more particularly, a higher incidence of carotid atherosclerotic disease.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with T1D. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and the presence of carotid plaques are established markers of subclinical atherosclerosis and important predictors of future cardiovascular events. The use of carotid ultrasound enables the identification of atherosclerosis in its early stages and has proven to be a valuable tool in assessing cardiovascular risk in T1D prompting clinicians to enhance cardioprotective treatments. Therefore, understanding and targeting the pathological processes and early markers of preclinical atherosclerosis in T1D subjects is critical for an early detection.

The present work aims to explore the association between the GMI/HbA1c ratio and the presence of preclinical carotid atherosclerosis in a well-defined cohort of subjects with T1D. By examining the GMI/HbA1c ratio, we aimed to assess whether this marker can improve cardiovascular risk stratification beyond traditional metrics like HbA1c alone.

### Level of agreement and correlation between the estimated hemoglobin A1c results derived by continuous or conventional glucose monitoring systems compared with the point-of-care or laboratory-based measurements: an observational study [^1157cnJm]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is an important marker for diabetes care management. With the increasing use of new technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and point-of-care testing (POCT), patients and their physicians have been able to monitor and continuously check their blood glucose levels in an efficient and timely manner. This study aimed to investigate the level of agreement between the standard laboratory test for HbA1c (Lab-HbA1c) with point-of-care testing (POCT-HbA1c) and glucose monitoring index (GMI) derived by intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) or estimated average glucose (eAG) derived by conventional self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) devices.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Diabetes Treatment Center, Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia, between May and December 2020 with 81 patients with diabetes who used the isCGM system (n = 30) or conventional finger-pricking SMBG system (n = 51). At the same visit, venous and capillary blood samples were taken for routine HbA1c analysis by the standard laboratory and POCT methods, respectively. Also, for isCGM users, the GMI data for 28 days (GMI-28) and 90 days (GMI-90) were obtained, while for SMBG users, eAG data for 30 days (eAG-30) and 90 days (eAG-90) were calculated. The limits of agreement in different HbA1c measurements were evaluated using a Bland-Altman analysis. Pearson correlation and multivariate linear regression analyses were also performed.

Results

Based on the Bland-Altman analysis, HbA1c levels for 96.7% and 96.1% of the patients analyzed by the POCT and the standard laboratory methods were within the range of the 95% limit of agreement in both isCGM and conventional SMBG users, respectively. About 93.3% of the GMI measurements were within the 95% limit of agreement. Also, about 94.12% of the eAG-30 and 90.2% of the eAG-90 measurements were within the 95% limit of agreement. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant positive correlation and linear regression among Lab-HbA1c, POCT-HbA1c, GMI, and eAG in both conventional SMBG and isCGM users (all p < 0.001). These positive results persisted significantly after adjusting for different factors (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

GMI derived by isCGM or eAG derived by conventional SMBG systems, as well as the POCT-HbA1c measurements, showed a high level of agreement; therefore, we recommend them as potential methods for diabetes monitoring, especially when a rapid result is needed or with patients with uncontrolled diabetes or on intensive insulin therapy.

### Can HbA1c alone Be safely used to guide insulin therapy in African youth with type 1 diabetes? [^1144UkpV]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relationship of HbA1c versus the mean blood glucose (MBG) is an important guide for diabetes management but may differ between ethnic groups. In Africa, the patient's glucose information is limited or unavailable and the management is largely guided by HbA1c. We sought to determine if the reference data derived from the non-African populations led to an appropriate estimation of MBG from HbA1c for the East African patients.

Methods

We examined the relationship of HbA1c versus MBG obtained by the continuous glucose monitoring in a group of East African youth having type 1 diabetes in Kenya and Uganda (n = 54) compared with the data obtained from A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) and glucose management indicator (GMI) studies. A self-identified White (European heritage) population of youth (n = 89) with type 1 diabetes, 3–18 years old, living in New Orleans, LA, USA metropolitan area (NOLA), was studied using CGM as an additional reference.

Results

The regression equation for the African cohort was MBG (mg/dL) = 32.0 + 16.73 × HbA1c (%), r = 0.55, p < 0.0001. In general, the use of the non-African references considerably overestimated MBG from HbA1c for the East African population. For example, an HbA1c = 9% (74.9 mmol/mol) corresponded to an MBG = 183 mg/dL (10.1 mmol/L) in the East African group, but 212 mg/dL (11.7 mmol/L) using ADAG, 237 mg/dL (13.1 mmol/L) using GMI and 249 mg/dL (13.8 mmol/L) using NOLA reference. The reported occurrence of serious hypoglycemia among the African patients in the year prior to the study was 21%. A reference table of HbA1c versus MBG from the East African patients was generated.

Conclusions

The use of non-African-derived reference data to estimate MBG from HbA1c generally led to the overestimation of MBG in the East African patients. This may put the East African and other African patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia when the management is primarily based on achieving target HbA1c in the absence of the corresponding glucose data.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115fjCzy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

A1C-based glycemic assessment — In people with diabetes, A1C reflects average glycemia over approximately 2–3 months, and measurement approximately every 3 months is used to determine whether glycemic goals have been reached and maintained. A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia, and for individuals prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with insulin deficiency and/or intensive insulin therapy) glycemic status is best evaluated by the combination of results from blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and A1C, because discordant results between A1C and BGM or CGM can occur due to high glycemic variability, inaccurate BGM or CGM measurement, or inaccurate A1C.

### Effect of continuous glucose monitoring on glycemic control in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes… [^1158fuBS]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Participants were randomized 1: 1 to undergo CGM or usual care using a blood glucose meter for glucose monitoring. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks. There were 20 secondary outcomes, including additional HbA1c outcomes, CGM glucose metrics, and patient-reported outcomes with adjustment for multiple comparisons to control for the false discovery rate. Mean HbA1c was 8. 9% at baseline and
8. 5% at 26 weeks in the CGM group and 8. 9% at both baseline and 26 weeks in the BGM group. Mean HbA1c was 8. 9% at baseline and
8. 5% at 26 weeks in the CGM group and was 8. 9% at both baseline and 26 weeks in the BGM group.

An HbA1c reduction from baseline to 26 weeks of at least 0. 5% was observed in 44% of the CGM group vs 21% of the BGM group at baseline and 43% during follow-up in the CGM group and 36% at baseline and. Quiz Ref IDThis randomized trial among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes showed a small but statistically significant lowering of HbA1c over 26 weeks of CGM use compared with standard BGM. This finding offers potential for clinical importance with a meaningful shift in the HbA1c distribution toward improved glycemic control; however, further research of longer duration and with clinical outcomes is needed before reaching definitive conclusions about the clinical value of the study's findings.

### Lack of validity of the glucose management indicator in type 1 diabetes in pregnancy [^11615aSG]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The glucose management indicator (GMI) is widely used as a replacement for HbA1c, but information in pregnancy is very limited. We assessed the accuracy of GMI and associations with pregnancy outcomes in type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We compared HbA1c, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics, GMI at 12, 24, and 34 weeks' gestation and outcomes in 220 women from the CGM in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (CONCEPTT) trial using logistic/linear regression and Bland-Altman plots.

Results

GMI equations performed less accurately in pregnancy, with higher bias, especially in first and third trimesters. GMI and mean CGM glucose had equivalent predictive capability over pregnancy outcomes. GMI did not offer additional predictive capability over time-in-range (63–140 mg/dL; 3.5–7.8 mmol/L), time-above-range (> 140 mg/dL; > 7.8 mmol/L), and average CGM glucose concentrations.

Conclusions

GMI is not an accurate replacement for HbA1c in pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes.

### Impacts of glycemic variability on the relationship between glucose management indicator from iPro2 and laboratory hemoglobin A1c in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^112XKCay]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The GMI formula was conceived using data derived from specific types of CGM sensors including Dexcom G4 and G5 (Dexcom, Inc. San Diego, CA), and mainly based on Caucasian populations. It was well known that the accuracy of measurement varied among different types of sensors. Although GMI formula has been validated by using Guardian Sensor 3 (Medtronic Inc. CA) and Freestyle Navigator II (Abbott Diabetes Care, CA) glucose sensors, the validation of the GMI formula for the retrospective CGM system with SOF sensor (Medtronic Minimed Inc. Northridge, CA, USA) in Asian populations is still lacking.

Moreover, previous studies have reported the discordance between GMI and laboratory HbA1c. – Therefore, the assessment of glycemic control based on laboratory HbA1c or GMI alone might mislead clinical decisions. The exact reasons for such a discrepancy remain unclear. Several studies have evaluated the effect of glycemic variability (GV) on the relationship between mean glucose and laboratory HbA1c, but the results were inconsistent. Most of these studies used self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) data to calculate GV and mean glucose, and the results showed that GV had no or minimal effect on the relationship between mean glucose and laboratory HbA1c. – On the contrary, a study by Kuenen JC et al. used CGM data instead of SMBG data and found that GV influenced the association between mean glucose and laboratory HbA1c in patients with T1D, with high GV leading to a higher HbA1c level for the same mean glucose. Given that the GMI was calculated from CGM derived mean glucose, we speculated that GV assessed by CGM data may have an impact on the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to validate the GMI formula using the iPro ™ 2 system with SOF sensor in Chinese adult patients with T1D and to further explore the impacts of GV on the relationship between GMI and laboratory HbA1c.

### Differences between glycated hemoglobin and glucose management indicator in real-time and intermittent scanning continuous glucose monitoring in adults with type 1 diabetes [^116XnqV1]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study demonstrates the difference between glucose management indicator (GMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) according to sensor mean glucose and HbA 1c status using 2 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors in people with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

A total of 275 subjects (117 Dexcom G6 [G6] and 158 FreeStyle Libre 1 [FL]) with type 1 diabetes was included. The G6 and FL sensors were used, respectively, over 90 days to analyze 682 and 515 glycemic profiles that coincide with HbA 1c.

Results

The mean HbA 1c was 6.6% in Dexcom G6 and 7.2% in FL profiles. In G6 profiles, GMI was significantly higher than HbA 1c irrespective of mean glucose (all P < .001, mean difference: 0.58% ± 0.49%). The GMI was significantly higher than the given HbA 1c when HbA 1c was below 8.0% (all P < .001). The discordance was the highest at 0.9% for lower HbA 1c values (5.0%-5.9%). The proportion of discordance > 0.5% improved from 60.1% to 30.9% when using the revised GMI equation in G6 profiles. In FL profile, the overall mean difference between GMI and HbA 1c was 0 (P = 0.966). The GMI was significantly lower by 0.9% than HbA 1c of 9.0% to 9.9% and higher by 0.5% in HbA 1c of 5.0% to 5.9% (all P < .001).

Conclusions

The GMI is overestimated in G6 users, particularly those with well-controlled diabetes, but the GMI and HbA 1c discordance improved with a revised equation from the observed data. The FL profile showed greater discordance for lower HbA 1c levels or higher HbA 1c levels.

Economic impact — continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technologies: In the United States, the total cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was $327 billion, and approximately 73% of these costs are directly related to treating avoidable complications of suboptimal glycemia. In a 2014 SWITCH randomized controlled trial analysis of 79 adults and 72 children with T1D, CGM with CSII showed a potential cost offset via fewer missed school days among children with > 70% sensor use versus the sensor-off arm (P = 0.0046). A United Kingdom study found that real-time CGM (rtCGM) versus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was associated with an incremental gain of 1.49 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with lower costs. In the DIAMOND cohort of 158 persons with MDI-treated T1D and A1C ≥ 7.5% randomized 2:1 to rtCGM or SMBG, rtCGM initially increased costs ($1,250.40) while improving QoL, reduced A1C (0.62%), reduced daily strip use (201 strips/y), and reduced nonsevere hypoglycemia events (25 episodes/y), and over a lifetime had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $98 108 per QALY with participants gaining 0.54 QALYs. Modeling in Spain comparing intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) versus SMBG in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 persons with T1D reported an annual cost/patient of $5450 for SMBG versus $3077 for isCGM, annual savings of $2328 per patient- year, and projected avoidance of approximately 4900 severe hypoglycemic events and 93 hospitalizations in 1 year, generating total savings of up to $2 326 916 per year.

Association of breakfast response CGM measures with GMI

A CGM-based measure increasingly used by physicians in lieu of HbA 1c is the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI). The GMI is defined mathematically as GMI (%) = 3.31 + 0.02392[average CGM glucose in mg/dL], where the average glucose is calculated over the duration of CGM wear. We first examined the relationship between GMI and HbA 1c for our participant cohort. We observed a correlation of 0.77 between GMI and HbA 1c; however, we do note that the GMI underestimates the HbA 1c at higher values (Supplementary Fig. 3(a)). We then computed a multiple linear regression with the same set of predictors as above to predict GMI instead of HbA 1c. We again found that starting glucose (p < 0.0001) and time to glucose peak (p < 0.0001) are significantly associated with the GMI. (Supplementary Table 4). The maximum glucose rise was close to but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.06). The model predicted GMI to be within (0.190.07)% (meanSD) of the true GMI value. (Supplementary Fig. 3(b)) Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated no systematic bias in the GMI predictions with a mean difference between true and predicted values being 0.0 (95% CI [−0.38, 0.38]; p = 1.0).

### Continuous glucose monitoring: a consensus conference of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology [^114kfiFU]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective/Methods

Barriers to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use continue to hamper adoption of this valuable technology for the management of diabetes. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology convened a public consensus conference February 20, 2016, to review available CGM data and propose strategies for expanding CGM access.

Results

Conference participants agreed that evidence supports the benefits of CGM in type 1 diabetes and that these benefits are likely to apply whenever intensive insulin therapy is used, regardless of diabetes type. CGM is likely to reduce healthcare resource utilization for acute and chronic complications, although real-world analyses are needed to confirm potential cost savings and quality of life improvements. Ongoing technological advances have improved CGM accuracy and usability, but more innovations in human factors, data delivery, reporting, and interpretation are needed to foster expanded use. The development of a standardized data report using similar metrics across all devices would facilitate clinician and patient understanding and utilization of CGM. Expanded CGM coverage by government and private payers is an urgent need.

Conclusion

CGM improves glycemic control, reduces hypoglycemia, and may reduce overall costs of diabetes management. Expanding CGM coverage and utilization is likely to improve the health outcomes of people with diabetes.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^11577bVq]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes, and, if achieved soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease. Therefore, a reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults with type 1 diabetes is < 7%. (B)
Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as < 6.5%) for select individual patients, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Appropriate patients might include those with a short duration of diabetes, a long life expectancy, hypoglycemia awareness, and no significant CVD. (C)
Less stringent A1C goals (such as < 8.5%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular/macrovascular complications, or extensive comorbid conditions. (B)
Glycemic control for those of any age with type 1 diabetes should be assessed based on frequent SMBG levels (and CGM data, if available) in addition to A1C in order to direct changes in therapy. (B)

### Unveiling the spectrum of glucose variability: a novel perspective on freeStyle libre monitoring data [^112RyX28]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the introduction of insulin therapy, it has become apparent that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is accompanied by long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. In the context of the many benefits of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), there remain opportunities to study the large amount of data now available in order to maximise its potential in the endeavour to reduce the occurrence of diabetes tissue complications in the longer term.

Methods

Continuous glucose monitoring values were downloaded for 89 type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) individuals for up to 18 months from 2021 to 2023. Data for patient demographics was also taken from the patient record which included Sex, Date of Birth, and Date of Diagnosis. The recorded laboratory glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test results were also recorded. The glucose management index (GMI) was calculated from average glucose readings for 18 months using the formula GMI (%) = (0.82 - (Average glucose/100)). This was then adjusted to give GMI (mmol/mol) = 10.929 * (GMI (%) - 2.15). Average Glucose Fluctuation (AGF) was calculated by adding up the total absolute change value between all recorded results over 18 months and dividing by the number of results minus one. The % Above Critical Threshold (ACT) was calculated by summing the total number of occurrences for each result value. A cumulative 95% limit was then applied to identify the glucose value that only 5% of results exceeded in the overall population. Using this value, we estimated the percentage of total tests that were above the Critical Threshold (ACT).

Results

The mean age of the participants was 42.6 years, and the mean duration of T1D was 18.4 years. A total of 3.22 million readings were analysed, yielding an average blood glucose level of 10.3 mmol/l and a GMI of 57.2 mmol/mol. There was a strong correlation between GMI and measured HbA1c (r² = 0.82). However, there were patients who had an above-critical threshold (ACT) of 4–10% at a GMI of 60 mmol/mol or less. The percentage average value at the time of day (%AVTD) was applied to all blood glucose readings at each 15-min interval throughout the day, averaged over 18 months. The %AVTD of GMI (overall average 57.2 mmol/mol) increased after midday, dipped at 18:00, and peaked at 22:00. The %AVTD of AGF (overall average 0.60 mmol/l) showed higher change rates after 09:00 declining at the end of the day. The %AVTD of ACT peaked at 22:00, with those having the highest %ACT showing an additional peak at 15:00.

Conclusions

We have shown here that the percentage glucose results above 18 mmol/l (top 5% of distribution) increased exponentially above 54 mmol/mol HbA1c. The %AVTD is introduced as a useful measure. Our data indicate that over the 24-h period, improvement in metabolic control could be focussed on the afternoon and evening, when there are higher-than-average levels of GMI, a higher-than-average degree of glucose change, and higher-than-average risks of being above the critical threshold. In conclusion, a measure of glycaemic variation based on the amplitude of glucose change to a population mean could be used to provide valuable clinical insights into glucose change over a 24-h period.

### Type 1 diabetes iron-deficiency anaemia case report and the clinical relevance of red blood cell lifespan-adjusted glycated haemoglobin [^112ZpJFv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Iron‐deficiency anaemia is routinely associated with longer RBCls. The iron therapy treatment likely increased RBC production and therefore reduced RBCls towards the normal range. The drastic drop in HbA1c level soon after initiation of iron therapy is consistent with the RBCls change and is probably attributable to the RBC production change rather than a change in glycaemia considering the stable 14‐day average glucose level.

The pA1c values derived from laboratory HbA1c and CGM readings are very similar. Since these reflect the average plasma glucose during the 2‐ to 4‐month RBCls, they vary slower and smoother than the 14‐day GMI. The aA1c value, which reflects intracellular RBC glucose exposure, was not perturbed by iron therapy, indicating that intracellular RBC glucose exposure was not affected by the therapy. When HbA1c was adjusted by AGR — which is mostly driven by RBCls change — we observed relatively stable glycaemic levels before and after iron therapy initiation, consistent with CGM. Adjusting HbA1c for RBC factors has the potential to improve clinical interpretation and agreement with CGM‐derived metrics.

In Figure 2B, iron‐deficiency anaemia is indicated by low haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, borderline ferritin levels, and high RDW before Day 161. Significant increases in haematocrit, haemoglobin and ferritin after Day 161 suggest a quick effect of the therapy. The fast RBCls reduction is supported by an increase in RDW and eventual reduction of RDW to the normal range after Day 273.

In Figure 3, the consistency between pA1c‐CGM and pA1c‐Lab is compared with the relationships between GMI and laboratory HbA1c. The comparison suggests a much improved, unbiased agreement between pA1c‐CGM and pA1c‐Lab (blue markers) compared to laboratory HbA1c and GMI (red markers).

### Evaluation of HbA1c and glucose management indicator discordance in a population of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^1161octk]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucose management indicator (GMI) is a useful metric for the clinical management of diabetic patients using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). In adults, a marked discordance between HbA1c and GMI has been reported. To date, no studies have evaluated this discordance in children/adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Methods

HbA1c and real-life CGM data of the 12weeks preceding HbA1c measurement were collected from 805 children/adolescents. The absolute difference between HbA1c and GMI was calculated for both the 12-week and 4-week periods preceding HbA1c measurement and the proportion of discordant patients was defined according to specific thresholds in the entire study population and in subjects stratified by type of CGM, insulin therapy, gender, age and puberty. Regression analyses were performed with HbA1c-GMI discordance as dependent variable and patients' characteristics as independent ones. A new GMI equation for children and adolescent was derived from the linear regression analysis between mean glucose and HbA1c.

Results

HbA1c-GMI discordance calculated on the 12-week period was < 0.1, ≥ 0.5 and ≥ 1.0 in 24.8, 33.9 and 9.2% of the subjects, respectively. No significant differences in the proportion of discordant patients were found comparing patients stratified by type of CGM, insulin therapy, gender, age and puberty. GMI-HbA1c discordance was not significantly explained by age, gender, BMI, type of CGM, insulin therapy, hemoglobin, anemia and autoimmune diseases (R 2 = 0.012, p = 0.409). HbA1c-GMI discordance calculated on the 4-week period was comparable. GMI (%) equation derived for this cohort was: 3.74+0.022x (mean glucose in mg/dl).

Conclusions

GMI could be meaningfully discordant respect to HbA1c in more than a third of children/adolescents with T1D. This discrepancy should be taken into careful consideration when the two indices are directly compared in daily clinical practice.

### The correlation of hemoglobin A1c to blood glucose [^114js3PP]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) represents the average blood glucose level of patients over the previous 120 days underlies the current management of diabetes. Even in making such a statement, we speak of "average blood glucose" as though "blood glucose" were itself a simple idea. When we consider all the blood glucose forms-arterial versus venous versus capillary, whole blood versus serum versus fluoride-preserved plasma, fasting versus nonfasting-we can start to see that this is not a simple issue. Nevertheless, it seems as though HbA1c correlates to any single glucose measurement. Having more than one measurement and taking those measurements in the preceding month improves the correlation further. In particular, by having glucose measurements that reflect both the relatively lower overnight glucose levels and measurements that reflect the postprandial peaks improves not only our ability to manage diabetes patients, but also our understanding of how HbA1c levels are determined. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices may take thousands of glucose results over a week. Several studies have shown that CGM glucose averages account for the vast proportion of the variation of HbA1c. The ability to relate HbA1c to average glucose may become a popular method for reporting HbA1c, eliminating current concerns regarding differences in HbA1c standardization. Hemoglobin A1c expressed as an average glucose may be more understandable to patients and improve not only their understanding, but also their ability to improve their diabetes management.

### Impacts of glycemic variability on the relationship between glucose management indicator from iPro2 and laboratory hemoglobin A1c in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^11566WDg]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

CGM parameter

CGM data from iPro ™ 2 sensor was downloaded via Carelink iPro and was calculated using Glyculator 2.0 software, which was allowed for calculation of every index of CGM recommended by the International Consensus.

GMI was calculated by applying CGM-derived mean glucose to the equation [GMI (%) = 3.31 + 0.02392 × mean glucose in mg/dl]. Hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) was calculated by subtracting the GMI from laboratory HbA1c [HGI = laboratory HbA1c (%) – GMI (%)]. Absolute value of HGI was used to describe the discrepancies between the GMI and laboratory-measured HbA1c. HGI groups were determined by HGI value tertile (low HGI, < 0.07; moderate HGI, 0.07–0.45; high HGI, > 0.45), and the differences of GMI and laboratory HbA1c were compared among different HGI groups.

GV was assessed by the standard deviation (SD), glucose coefficient of variation (CV), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). CV was calculated by dividing the SD by the mean of the corresponding glucose readings. MAGE algorithm was adapted from the P. Baguhrst version.SD and MAGE were stratified according to their quartiles.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — assessment of glycemic status states that glycemic status is assessed by A1C measurement, blood glucose monitoring (BGM) by capillary finger-stick devices, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using time in range (TIR) or mean CGM glucose. Glucose monitoring via CGM or BGM is described as useful for diabetes self-management, providing nuanced information on glucose responses to meals, physical activity, and medication changes, and may be particularly useful in individuals taking insulin. CGM is noted to serve an increasingly important role in optimizing the effectiveness and safety of treatment in many people with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or other forms of diabetes, and individuals on a variety of insulin treatment plans can benefit from CGM with improved glucose levels, decreased hypoglycemia, and enhanced self-efficacy.

The guideline states, "The primary goal for effective and safe glucose management is to reduce the %TBR, while increasing the %TIR", and notes that "every 10% increase in %TIR corresponds to a decrease in A1C of approximately 0.5%". For most adults with diabetes, "an appropriate goal is to achieve a %TIR 70 to 180 mg/dL goal of > 70% (> 15 hours, 48 min/d), if this can be achieved without an unacceptable risk of hypoglycemia (%TBR of < 4% at < 70 mg/dL, and < 1% at < 54 mg/dL)".

### A view beyond HbA1c: role of continuous glucose monitoring [^116S7dn6]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The literature suggests that ethnic and racial differences exist in the degrees of glycation that affect the accuracy of HbA1c measurements. For example, HbA1c concentration is higher (by 0.2–0.4%) in US African Americans and Hispanic populations than in Caucasians. The impact of age and race on HbA1c is currently under discussion. Some studies show that the HbA1c concentration increases by approximately 1 mmol/mol (0.1%) per decade of life and that this age effect results from decreasing red blood cell count with age. Despite these limitations, the diabetes research community has made considerable progress in agreeing upon core glycemic outcomes beyond HbA1c to overcome the above limitations.

In this review, we address the latest evidence for the use of alternative metrics of glucose control in patients with diabetes. We also discuss the impact of novel metrics on diabetes-related complications, the usefulness of CGM in the treatment of type 2 DM, and the impact of newer glucose-lowering agents on alternative glycemic metrics beyond HbA1c.

Wilson et al. recently used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to estimate mean blood glucose (MG) and calculate an MG-to-HbA 1c ratio to assess biological variation in HbA 1c in pediatric type 1 diabetic patients. The authors reported that patients with relatively low or high ratios at one clinic visit tended to have similarly low or high ratios at subsequent visits. The same group previously used CGM-derived MG to calculate the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) as a measure of biological variation in HbA 1c. Their results showed that HGI was quantitatively consistent within individuals at baseline and at follow-up clinic visits. This observation confirmed prior reports of HGI consistency within patients over time where MG was estimated using less advanced technologies such as patient blood glucose meter data or timed glucose profile sets. Because CGM is widely accepted as the gold standard for directly estimating MG, the studies by Wilson et al. both strongly suggest that interindividual variation in HGI is not an artifact of interindividual bias in blood glucose measurement.

### Correlation between short-and mid-term hemoglobin A1c and glycemic control determined by continuous glucose monitoring [^111vnjBM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Several factors may alter the relationship between the mean blood glucose levels and HbA1c values. For instance, variable red cell turnover may be affected by hyperglycemia. Moreover, glycation rates may differ among individuals at the same mean blood glucose levels. Notably, the negative correlation between measured mean glucose levels and HbA1c values 3 months after CGM may also suggest an improvement in the mean glucose levels after the intervention based on the CGM results.

In conclusion, the association of CGM results with HbA1c values 1 month after monitoring was positive. Furthermore, CGM could record glucose variability and is a reliable tool to assess glycemic state and improve DM management.

A trial of once-daily BGM with enhanced feedback found no clinically or statistically significant change in A1C levels at 1 year. Meta-analyses have suggested that BGM can reduce A1C levels by 0.25–0.3% at 6 months, but the effect was attenuated at 12 months in one analysis. Reductions in A1C levels were greater (−0.3%) in trials where structured BGM data were used to adjust medications, and a structured BGM group reduced their A1C levels by 0.3% more than the control group; however, A1C levels were not changed significantly without such structured diabetes therapy adjustment. Performing BGM alone does not lower blood glucose levels, and the information must be integrated into clinical and self-management treatment plans.
