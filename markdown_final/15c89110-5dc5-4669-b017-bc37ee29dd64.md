## Question

treatment plan for migraines and rule out other headaches

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a treatment plan for migraines and how to rule out other headache disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnosis using ICHD-3 and a focused history and neurologic exam. Then, I should verify red flags and when to order imaging. Next, I will consider acute treatment stratification and timing, including routes and special populations, and I need to check how to manage non-responders. After that, I will examine preventive indications and options, including CGRP-targeted therapies and chronic migraine care. Finally, I will confirm monitoring, disability assessment, medication-overuse counseling, and follow-up to prevent chronification and ensure safety and effectiveness.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor: apply ICHD-3 systematically through a detailed history capturing attack duration, pain quality and intensity, activity aggravation, associated symptoms, and aura features, and then define frequency to distinguish episodic from chronic migraine; if one criterion is missing, label as probable migraine pending follow-up, and ensure a normal neurologic exam supports a primary migraine diagnosis [^114u9R7g] [^115ubQGA] [^112w56ZH].

> Wait, let me verify potential secondary causes before I commit to treatment plans: I should screen for red flags including thunderclap onset, new headache after age 50, progressive change, systemic illness, focal neurologic signs or papilledema, and post-trauma headache; any abnormal exam or red flag warrants targeted evaluation before labeling this as primary migraine, so I must not jump to conclusions here [^112JQnUA] [^116BXpqN] [^115SG2oJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging pathway: I initially thought MRI would be first-line for hemorrhage, but non-contrast head CT is actually first-line to exclude acute hemorrhage with lumbar puncture if CT is normal and suspicion remains, whereas MRI is preferred for posterior fossa, inflammatory, infectious, or other secondary processes and avoids ionizing radiation; I need to remember that MRI can reveal incidental findings, so I should order imaging only when the history or exam suggests a secondary cause [^112JQnUA] [^116A1wCN].

> Let me consider the clinical differentials carefully: tension-type headache typically presents with bilateral, pressing, mild-to-moderate pain without migrainous accompaniments and not aggravated by routine activity, while cluster headache features short, severe unilateral pain with ipsilateral cranial autonomic signs; I should also double-check for medication-overuse headache in patients with frequent or escalating headaches, as MOH often confounds chronic migraine presentations [^116BXpqN] [^112BfB8o].

> Next, I should review acute treatment strategy using stratified care rather than step-care; for mild-to-moderate attacks I will offer NSAIDs early, and for moderate-to-severe attacks or insufficient response to NSAIDs I should offer a triptan promptly, treating as early in the attack as feasible while balancing diagnostic certainty; I need to ensure rescue plans and explicitly avoid opioids or butalbital except in refractory situations [^114NWJ8R] [^116NLNoZ] [^113xNmhU] [^117Eu8tw] [^111VS4zm] [^1168bfSC] [^116AKjca] [^1137CPkd].

> I will now examine practical choices, routes, and special situations: combination sumatriptan 50–85 mg plus naproxen 500 mg can be considered for acute attacks; in severe attacks or when early vomiting occurs, nasal zolmitriptan or subcutaneous sumatriptan are reasonable; in pregnancy, I should first offer acetaminophen for short-term relief of mild-to-moderate headache and, after discussing risks, consider sumatriptan when needed; I need to ensure I counsel on medication-overuse risk at the outset to prevent MOH [^112brsaB] [^11296RJh] [^115ANi6j] [^111r7sWg] [^114tzGAQ].

> But wait, what if triptans fail or are contraindicated? I should double-check that the patient tried an adequate dose and timing and then consider a trial of a different oral triptan before switching class; for nonpregnant adults who do not respond to more than one oral triptan or cannot take triptans, ditans are an option, while gepants are also reasonable though many analyses still rank the best-performing triptans highest for rapid sustained pain freedom; shared decision-making around cost, tolerability, and access is essential [^1153BGL4] [^1145YhJg] [^113qhBDW] [^112JzNsE].

> I need to check preventive indications and options now: for frequent, disabling, or poorly controlled attacks, or when acute therapies are overused, I should initiate preventive therapy tailored to comorbidities and preferences, considering agents like topiramate, beta-blockers, amitriptyline or venlafaxine, and in appropriate cases onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine or CGRP monoclonal antibodies for episodic or chronic migraine after conventional failures; I should confirm chronic migraine is managed with specialist input and modifiable risk factors addressed [^111Ua5CV] [^114KfP2n] [^116Sy3NV] [^111ZpTG6].

> I should confirm how to measure response and when to stop: use diaries and validated scales to document monthly migraine days and disability, target at least 50% reduction in episodic or 30% in chronic migraine over about 12 weeks for most preventives, and consider longer horizons for onabotulinumtoxinA or CGRP mAbs; for acute agents, I need to treat three attacks before declaring failure, ensuring correct dose and timing; functional disability should also be assessed around 2 hours post-dose in acute therapy evaluations [^115mnxxc] [^1138339u] [^112yaSt1] [^114qFCST].

> Next, I should review longitudinal care to prevent chronification: I need to ensure education on triggers, sleep, hydration, and behavioral therapies, monitor for transformation to chronic migraine, and incorporate self-management support where appropriate since structured programs can improve outcomes in primary care populations with chronic headaches; regular follow-up to reassess diagnosis, adherence, efficacy, and adverse effects is essential [^114KfP2n] [^114FTR4U] [^114KzJdX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also align with current evidence syntheses and guideline standards: contemporary international guidelines emphasize standardized, evidence-based pharmacologic choices and value assessments to improve access and consistency of care, so my plan should remain adaptable as new high-quality guidance and real-world evidence emerge [^112acAdh] [^113ymzAS].

---

A comprehensive migraine treatment plan starts with **ICHD-3-based diagnosis** [^114u9R7g] and exclusion of secondary causes using history, exam, and red flags (e.g. sudden onset, age > 50, focal deficits) [^112JQnUA] [^116A1wCN]. For acute attacks, use **NSAIDs or acetaminophen first-line** for mild-to-moderate episodes [^114NWJ8R], and triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks or when NSAIDs are inadequate [^113xNmhU] [^112JzNsE]. Consider gepants or ditans if triptans are contraindicated or ineffective [^1145YhJg] [^113qhBDW]. Preventive therapy is indicated for **≥ 4 attacks/month** or significant disability, with options including beta-blockers, topiramate, CGRP monoclonal antibodies [^116Sy3NV], or onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine [^114KfP2n]. Educate on trigger avoidance, lifestyle changes, and medication overuse; monitor with headache diaries [^114qFCST] and reassess regularly [^116Uedce] [^111Ua5CV].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and differentiation

### Clinical history and examination

Obtain a **detailed history** [^114u9R7g] that includes age at onset, duration, frequency, pain characteristics (location, quality, severity, aggravating/relieving factors), associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia), aura, and medication use [^115ubQGA]. Perform a focused neurologic and head/neck examination [^112JQnUA], and pursue neuroimaging if abnormalities or red flags are present [^116A1wCN].

---

### Red flags indicating secondary headache disorders

Secondary headache is suggested by features such as sudden onset ("thunderclap"), age > 50, increasing frequency or severity, a new headache with underlying illness, systemic symptoms, focal neurologic signs, papilledema, or headache after trauma [^112JQnUA]. When secondary headache is suspected, **obtain MRI** [^116A1wCN]; avoid routine neuroimaging in typical migraine presentations [^114u9R7g].

---

### Differential diagnosis

- **Tension-type**: Bilateral, pressing/tightening [^116BXpqN], mild-to-moderate, not aggravated by activity [^114u9R7g], no nausea/photophobia/phonophobia.

- **Cluster**: Severe unilateral attacks (15–180 min) [^114u9R7g] with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms [^116BXpqN].

- **Medication overuse**: Headache on ≥ 15 days/month [^114u9R7g] with regular overuse of acute medications [^116BXpqN].

---

## Acute treatment strategies

### First-line acute treatments

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|-|
| Ibuprofen | Mild-to-moderate | 400 mg; increase to 600 mg if ineffective [^116NLNoZ] |
| Acetaminophen | Mild-to-moderate; pregnancy | 1,000 mg [^115ANi6j] |
| Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan) | Moderate-to-severe | Sumatriptan 50–100 mg [^112JzNsE]; nasal zolmitriptan or SC sumatriptan for severe/early vomiting [^117Eu8tw] [^11296RJh] |

---

### Second-line and alternative acute treatments

- **Gepants**: Ubrogepant, rimegepant for triptan contraindications or inadequate response [^112JzNsE].

- **Ditans**: Lasmiditan for refractory cases or triptan contraindications [^113qhBDW] [^1145YhJg].

- **Combination**: Sumatriptan 50–85 mg + naproxen 500 mg for enhanced efficacy [^112brsaB].

---

### Medications to avoid

Avoid **opioids and butalbital-containing medications** except in refractory cases [^1137CPkd]; they should not be used for routine acute migraine management.

---

## Preventive treatment strategies

Preventive therapy is indicated for patients with **frequent attacks (≥ 4/month)**, significant disability, or an inadequate response to acute treatments [^113ifG9D].

---

### First-line preventive medications

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol, metoprolol [^113ifG9D].

- **Anticonvulsants**: Topiramate, valproate [^111Ua5CV].

- **Antidepressants**: Amitriptyline, venlafaxine [^111ZpTG6].

---

### Second-line and emerging preventive treatments

CGRP mAbs — such as erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab — are options for **episodic or chronic migraine** [^116Sy3NV]. OnabotulinumtoxinA is indicated for **chronic migraine (≥ 15 days/month)** [^114KfP2n] [^114u9R7g].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **lifestyle measures** such as regular sleep, hydration, a balanced diet, exercise, and stress management [^111Ua5CV]. Behavioral options include cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques [^114FTR4U]. Neuromodulation with non-invasive devices (e.g. transcutaneous supraorbital stimulation) may be appropriate for select patients [^114PUycX].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Patient education and self-management should emphasize **trigger identification and avoidance**, the risks of medication overuse [^114tzGAQ], and adherence to therapy [^1168bfSC]. Use headache diaries to track frequency, severity, triggers, and responses [^114qFCST]. Provide resources and connect patients with support groups to improve adherence and outcomes [^114FTR4U].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **regular reassessment** of treatment efficacy, adherence, and adverse effects, with therapy adjustments based on response and patient preference [^1138339u]. Proactively monitor for medication overuse and address it to prevent medication-overuse headache [^114tzGAQ].

---

A comprehensive migraine treatment plan requires **accurate diagnosis**, exclusion of secondary causes, and individualized acute and preventive therapies, with education and regular follow-up to optimize outcomes [^111Ua5CV].

Information on headache-related disability helps clinicians create the optimal treatment plan for migraine sufferers. The estimation of disability must be determined by gathering the individual effects of multiple headache attacks within a given period of time. This study was aimed at examining migraine-related disability from diary-based assessment and determining which elements of headache characteristics are associated with disability.

- **Methods**: Ninety-two migraine patients were enrolled, contributing data on a total of 422 diary days of headache attacks. Each diary booklet comprised questions on headache features and disability, including five items derived from the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS).

- **Results**: The average days recorded with disability for one or more of the three aspects of activities per headache attack was 0.55. Amongst the headache variables, pain intensity, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, type of abortive treatment, and employment status were significantly correlated with disability. On regression analysis, pain intensity, nausea/vomiting, and employed work status were identified as significant predicting factors for migraine-related disability.

- **Conclusion**: These results demonstrated that a considerable amount of disability could occur during a migraine attack, and there are specific elements that contribute to the development of disability.

### Evaluation of acute headaches in adults [^112JQnUA]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Classifying headaches as primary (migraine, tension-type, or cluster) or secondary can facilitate evaluation and management. A detailed headache history helps to distinguish among the primary headache disorders. "Red flags" for secondary disorders include sudden onset of headache, onset of headache after 50 years of age, increased frequency or severity of headache, new onset of headache with an underlying medical condition, headache with concomitant systemic illness, focal neurologic signs or symptoms, papilledema, and headache subsequent to head trauma. A thorough neurologic examination should be performed, with abnormal findings warranting neuroimaging to rule out intracranial pathology.

The preferred imaging modality to rule out hemorrhage is noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scanning, followed by lumbar puncture if the CT scan is normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive than CT scanning and less widely available; however, MRI reveals more detail and is necessary for imaging the posterior fossa. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can help to confirm or rule out hemorrhage, infection, tumor, and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension. Referral is appropriate for patients with headaches that are difficult to diagnose, worsen, or fail to respond to management.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114u9R7g]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The medical history is the mainstay of migraine diagnosis; with the assistance of a range of published aids (see the section Diagnostic aids), a full history should enable systematic application of the criteria set out in the ICHD-3. Physical examination is most often confirmatory, and further investigations (for example, neuroimaging, blood samples, or lumbar puncture) are occasionally required to confirm or reject suspicions of secondary causes for headache.

- **Medical history**: An adequate medical history must include at least the following: age at onset of headache; duration of headache episodes; frequency of headache episodes; pain characteristics (for example, location, quality, severity, aggravating factors, and relieving factors); accompanying symptoms (for example, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting); aura symptoms (if any); and history of acute and preventive medication use. All are essential for the application of the ICHD-3 criteria.

- **Diagnostic criteria**: The ICHD-3 criteria, which were developed by the International Headache Society, set out the clinical features that establish the diagnosis of migraine and its types and subtypes. These criteria prioritize specificity over sensitivity, so an additional set of criteria are given for a diagnosis of probable migraine, which is defined as "migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine". Probable migraine is a diagnosis pending confirmation during early follow-up.

### Medications approved for preventing migraine headaches [^116Sy3NV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Migraine is the third-most prevalent disease in the world and affects approximately 39 million individuals in the United States alone. Migraine occurs in nearly 1 in 7 individuals between 15 and 49 years of age and is 3 times more frequent in women than in men. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved three new humanized monoclonal antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP): erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. The agents either bind to the CGRP receptor (erenumab) or bind to the CGRP ligand (fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and block its binding to the receptor. All three products are indicated for the preventative treatment of episodic or chronic migraine in adults. The available studies at the time of writing document that these agents reduce migraine attacks. The CGRP monoclonal antibodies offer patients new options once they have exhausted other treatments.

Transformation to chronic migraine

Some estimates suggest that up to 3% of patients with episodic migraine experience transformation to chronic migraine each year. The reliability of such estimates is uncertain because chronic migraine is often conflated with medication overuse headache (MOH), but transformation to chronic migraine does occur. Recognized risk factors include female sex, a high headache frequency, inadequate treatment, overuse of acute medications, and a range of comorbidities including depression, anxiety, and obesity. Recognition of these risk factors is part of good clinical management, as their modification can prevent transformation.

Once chronic migraine has developed, its management is challenging, and referral to specialist care is usually necessary. If MOH, which frequently causes symptoms that suggest chronic migraine, can be ruled out, then a preventive treatment should be established. Individuals with chronic migraine should also be educated on the modifiable risk factors for chronic migraine so that they can make lifestyle changes that might help.

Preventive medications for which evidence supports effectiveness in chronic migraine include topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinA, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Topiramate is the drug of first choice owing to its much lower cost. Regulatory restrictions generally limit the use of onabotulinumtoxinA and CGRP antibodies to patients in whom two or three other preventive medications have failed, despite the fact that topiramate is the only other treatment with evidence supporting its use. Three CGRP antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) can be considered for patients who have not responded to previous treatments.

### Acute migraine headache: Treatment strategies [^1178PHGs]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for migraine, specifically in the management of acute attacks, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend offering NSAIDs as the first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate migraine.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116AKjca]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Timing of administration**: The recommendations for timing of acute treatment should be clearly defined in the trial protocol. Typically, participants are advised to administer treatment when migraine headache pain reaches at least moderate intensity. However, alternative strategies include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, when pain intensity is mild, or when pain intensity is severe. The timing of the treatment must align with the objectives of the trial. Participants should consistently record the time and pain intensity at the moment of treatment in the trial diary.

The head pain associated with migraine often initiates with mild intensity, gradually escalating to a peak before resolving. During a migraine attack, headache pain may also fluctuate spontaneously. These characteristics pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment and the evaluation of trial results. Healthcare providers generally recommend early treatment in the course of a migraine attack, while the pain is mild, to enhance efficacy. However, distinguishing migraine without aura from non-migraine headaches at the onset can be challenging. Consequently, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat at the first sign of migraine might mistakenly treat other headache types. This potential confusion can be mitigated when the migraine attacks are allowed to fully develop, providing clearer distinction for treatment timing.

### Treatment approaches to maximizing therapeutic response in migraine [^111VS4zm]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic condition that presents with episodic disabling attacks, which can respond unpredictably to therapies. Studies support early treatment intervention strategies as part of the routine clinical care of migraine patients. Identifying illness severity and stratifying treatment accordingly (as in other diseases such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension) improves patient outcome. Assessing the presence of any coexisting conditions, such as depression or anxiety, is another essential part of managing migraine.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine, summary version [^112acAdh]. Cephalalgia (2025). High credibility.

We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the GRADE approach for assessing the quality of evidence.

The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.

### SIGN 155 pharmacological management of migraine: A national clinical guideline [^112brsaB]. SIGN (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of migraine, particularly in managing acute attacks, the SIGN 2023 guidelines recommend considering combination therapy with sumatriptan (50–85 mg) and naproxen (500 mg) for patients experiencing acute migraine.

### Evidence-based review and frontiers of migraine therapy [^113ZQGo9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

**Key points**: The past decade has brought groundbreaking advances in the treatment of migraine and other headache disorders. Novel therapies for migraine target the CGRP pathway, 5-HT receptor subsets, and/or neuromodulation, which interrupt the neurophysiologic mechanisms of the migraine attack. Newer therapies in migraine have resulted from a further understanding of migraine pathophysiology and may prove to be useful in the future treatment of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) due to the potential overlap in the pathophysiology of the two diseases.

### Millions of migraine attacks, many answers, more questions [^111dm3bZ]. Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

In the landscape of migraine treatment, many unanswered questions remain — particularly, which medications are most effective as acute agents and for which patients? Given the heterogeneity of patients, clinicians' practice, and the integration of new agents into migraine care, this is an ambitious question to address. At the same time, this question is crucial both because proper acute treatment is an important metric of quality of care and such treatments are woefully underused in the general population.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for real-world evidence studies in migraine and cluster headache [^111MNjCc]. Cephalalgia (2025). High credibility.

Real-world evidence studies are an important tool for investigating the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of treatments for headache disorders in clinical practice. These studies use data generated from routine clinical practice from a variety of sources and can help identify unmet needs in headache care and guide new therapies. This includes populations not always included in randomized clinical trials, such as those of different ages, with comorbidities, and on concomitant stable treatments. Real-world evidence pertains to the clinical evidence surrounding the utilization, as well as the potential advantages or drawbacks, of treatment, which is extracted through an analysis of real-world data.

- **Unique challenges**: Real-world evidence studies can present unique challenges, including the timing of data collection (prospective vs retrospective), data selection, data quality issues, and potential biases (such as selection or confounding factors). The International Headache Society has developed these guidelines for optimizing the design and conduct of real-world evidence studies, thereby enhancing the strength and reliability of their output.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114KzJdX]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of literature, and the consensus statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology.

In this consensus statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities, as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### Treatment recommendations for migraine [^116Uedce]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be classified into acute or preventive. Acute treatment aims to halt the progression of an attack or alleviate pain and functional impairment once an attack has commenced, whereas preventive therapy is administered to reduce attack frequency and severity. Additional benefits of preventive therapy include enhancing responsiveness to acute treatment and decreasing disability.

- **Treatment protocols**: Should include education and reassurance, avoidance of triggers, nonpharmacological treatments, and physical and/or complementary medicine when appropriate. The treatment plan should be reassessed at regular intervals.

- **Acute attack medication**: Can be specific or nonspecific and must be tailored to the individual patient. Backup and rescue medication should be available if the initial treatment is unsuccessful. The route of drug administration depends on attack severity, the speed of escalation, patient preference, the presence or absence of severe nausea or vomiting, and the need for rapid relief.

- **Preventive migraine treatments**: Include beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Selection is based on the drugs' side-effect profiles and the patient's existing and comorbid conditions.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^112yaSt1]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

Functional disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are important secondary global measures that account for the impact of headache and associated symptoms, as well as any adverse effects of treatment.

Recommendation:

Subjects should assess functional disability just before and up to two hours after the administration of acute treatment, before the use of rescue medication, using a simple verbal, numerical scale. The following question is recommended: "How well can you function right now?" Response options should be: 0 = no disability (i.e. able to function normally); 1 = mild disability (i.e. able to perform all activities of daily living but with some difficulty); 2 = moderate disability (i.e. unable to perform certain activities of daily living); 3 = severe disability (i.e. unable to perform most to all activities of daily living or requiring bed rest).

Comments:

Disability can be defined as a decrement in any of a range of domains (cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, or participation) or as the sum of difficulties, impairment, and decreased productivity in daily activities. HRQoL refers to the overall effect of illness and its therapy on the perception of the ability to live a useful and fulfilling life, including physical and mental components, general health perception, and level of performance/participation in different roles. Restoring the ability to function and improving quality of life are among the main objectives of acute migraine treatment.

The guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition provide new information that will affect the design, conduct, and reporting of clinical trials in migraine. This edition supersedes the existing guidelines and should be implemented immediately in clinical practice.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^111PePsy]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

The quality of clinical trials is an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Scientific and clinical developments in headache medicine led to second and third editions in 2000 and 2012, respectively. The current, fourth edition of the guidelines retains the structure and much content from previous editions. However, it also incorporates evidence from clinical trials published after the third edition as well as feedback from meetings with regulators, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Its final form reflects the collective expertise and judgement of the committee. These updated recommendations and commentary are intended to meet the society's continuing objective of providing a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of randomised controlled trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116BXpqN]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Differential diagnoses for migraine include other primary headache disorders and some secondary headache disorders. Distinction from other primary headache disorders is a prerequisite for successful management, whereas distinction from secondary headache disorders is crucial because some of these disorders are serious and potentially life-threatening, for example, meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage.

- **Characteristics of primary headache disorders**: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the only other paroxysmal headache disorder that is prevalent in the general population. TTH lacks the symptoms that accompany migraine and usually involves bilateral, mild to moderate pain with a pressing or tightening quality that is not aggravated by routine physical activity. Cluster headache is a much less prevalent primary headache disorder that affects approximately 0.1% of the general population. Its features are highly characteristic and include frequently recurrent but short-lasting attacks (15–180 minutes) of strictly unilateral headache of severe or very severe intensity. The head pain is accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, and nasal congestion.

- **Red flags associated with secondary headaches**: Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder that is an important differential diagnosis for chronic migraine. This disorder commonly develops from overuse of acute medication to treat migraine attacks, so the two disorders are often related.

### Migraine [^115SG2oJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Migraine affects about 1 billion people worldwide, and up to 15% of adults in the United States experience migraine attacks in any given year. It is associated with substantial adverse socioeconomic and personal effects, ranking as the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide across all ages, and the leading cause in women aged 15 to 49 years. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the likelihood of unnecessary investigations and suboptimal management. This article advises clinicians on diagnosing migraine, ruling out secondary headache disorders, developing acute and preventive treatment plans, and determining when to refer the patient to a specialist.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^117YUryu]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month.

In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours as a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

- **Early intervention**: To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice.

The ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for primary headache disorders outline the following:

- **Migraine without aura**: At least five attacks fulfilling criteria 2–5. Headache attacks lasting 4–72 hours when untreated or unsuccessfully treated. The headache has at least two of the following four characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (e.g. walking or climbing stairs). At least one of the following during the headache: nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

- **Migraine with aura**: At least two attacks fulfilling criteria 2 and 3. One or more of the following fully reversible aura symptoms: visual, sensory, speech and/or language, motor, brainstem, and retinal. At least three of the following six characteristics: at least one aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥ 5 minutes; two or more aura symptoms occur in succession; each individual aura symptom lasts 5–60 minutes; at least one aura symptom is unilateral; at least one aura symptom is positive; the aura is accompanied by or followed by headache within 60 minutes. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

- **Chronic migraine**: Headache (migraine-like or tension-type-like) on ≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months fulfilling criteria 2 and 3. Attacks occur in an individual who has had at least five attacks that fulfill the criteria for migraine without aura and/or for migraine with aura. On ≥ 8 days/month for > 3 months, criteria 3 and 4 for migraine without aura.

Clinical trials are a key component of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for Controlled Trials of Drugs in Migraine. Advances in drugs, devices, and biologicals, as well as novel trial designs, have prompted several updates over the nearly 30 years since, including most recently the guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of chronic migraine (2018), guidelines for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults (2019), and guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment of migraine in children and adolescents (2019). The present update incorporates findings from new research and is intended to optimize the design of controlled trials of preventive pharmacological treatment of episodic migraine in adults. A guideline for clinical trials with devices will be published separately.

The quality of clinical trials is an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Scientific and clinical developments in headache medicine led to the second and third editions in 2000 and 2012, respectively. The current, fourth edition of the guidelines retains the structure and much content from previous editions. However, it also incorporates evidence from clinical trials published after the third edition, as well as feedback from meetings with regulators, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Its final form reflects the collective expertise and judgment of the Committee. These updated recommendations and commentary are intended to meet the Society's continuing objective of providing a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of randomized controlled trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^112w56ZH]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

- **When to suspect migraine**: In the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine. The clinical characteristics of each must be considered to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

- **Migraine without aura**: Migraine without aura is characterized by headache attacks that last 4–72 hours. Typical features of an attack include a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity. However, bilateral pain is not uncommon, as population-based data indicate that approximately 40% of individuals with migraine report bilateral pain during attacks. The most common associated symptoms are photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Before the onset of pain, prodromal symptoms can include a depressed mood, yawning, fatigue, and cravings for specific foods. After resolution of the headache, postdromal symptoms can last up to 48 hours and often include tiredness, concentration difficulties, and neck stiffness.

- **Migraine with aura**: Approximately one third of individuals with migraine experience aura, either with every attack or with some attacks. Aura is defined as transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede, but sometimes accompany, the headache phase of a migraine attack. In more than 90% of affected individuals, aura manifests visually, classically as fortification spectra. Sensory symptoms occur in approximately 31% of affected individuals and are usually experienced as predominantly unilateral.

### Chronic migraine: Classification, characteristics and treatment [^116dzD1W]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

According to the revised 2nd Edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, primary headaches can be categorized as chronic or episodic. Chronic migraine is defined as headaches in the absence of medication overuse, occurring on ≥ 15 days per month for ≥ 3 months, of which headaches on ≥ 8 days must fulfill the criteria for migraine without aura.

Prevalence and incidence data for chronic migraine are still uncertain, owing to the heterogeneous definitions used to identify the condition in population-based studies over the past two decades. Chronic migraine is severely disabling and difficult to manage, as affected patients experience substantially more frequent headaches, comorbid pain and affective disorders, and fewer pain-free intervals than those with episodic migraine.

Data on the treatment of chronic migraine are scarce because most migraine-prevention trials excluded patients who had headaches for ≥ 15 days per month. Despite this lack of reliable data, a wealth of expert opinion and a few evidence-based treatment options are available for managing chronic migraine. Trial data are available for topiramate and botulinum toxin type A, and expert opinion suggests that conventional preventive therapy for episodic migraine may also be useful.

This review discusses the evolution of our understanding of chronic migraine, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment options.

### Comparative effects of drug interventions for the acute management of migraine episodes in adults: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112JzNsE]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by disabling, recurring episodes of moderate to severe headache and accompanying symptoms lasting up to 72 hours. Migraine affects more than one billion people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability in girls and women aged 15 to 49 years. The burden of migraine extends to personal welfare, reduced productivity, and poor socioeconomic outcomes.

The acute management of migraine episodes consists of drug interventions aimed at providing rapid and sustained pain relief and, ideally, freedom from pain. Several drugs with different mechanisms of action are available. International clinical guidelines generally endorse non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as initial treatment, whereas triptans are recommended for moderate to severe episodes or when the response to NSAIDs is insufficient. In recent years, lasmiditan and gepants have been introduced as further treatment options, especially for patients with contraindications to triptans due to potential vasoconstrictive effects and higher risk of ischemic events. However, no clear consensus exists as to which specific agents from these drug classes should be selected initially.

Given the wide range of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine, clinicians and patients need robust evidence to make the best, individualized choice in routine practice. Network meta-analyses allow for estimation of comparative efficacy, providing a comprehensive summary of the evidence base and understanding of the relative merits of the multiple interventions.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^113WrtPk]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine is a highly disabling primary headache disorder with a 1-year prevalence of approximately 15% in the general population. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, migraine is the second most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is responsible for more disability than all other neurological disorders combined.

Migraine manifests clinically as attacks of headache with a range of accompanying symptoms. In approximately one third of individuals with migraine, headache is sometimes or always preceded or accompanied by transient neurological disturbances, referred to as migraine aura. Furthermore, a minority of those affected develop chronic migraine, in which attacks become highly frequent. The pathogenesis of migraine is widely believed to involve peripheral and central activation of the trigeminovascular system, and cortical spreading depression is thought to be the underlying neurophysiological substrate of migraine aura. However, much remains unknown about specific pathogenic processes and few mechanism-based treatment options currently exist.

Treatments for migraine include acute and preventive medications and a range of non-pharmacological therapies. Despite these treatment options and the comprehensive diagnostic criteria, clinical care remains suboptimal — misdiagnosis and under-treatment of migraine are substantial public health challenges. Population-based data from Europe indicate that preventive medication for migraine is used by only 2–14% of eligible individuals, an alarming finding that calls for global action.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116XHMJM]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Stratification**: Recommendations indicate that stratification is not usually required in acute treatment trials. However, it may be considered when imbalances between treatment groups or significant factors might influence trial outcomes. Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects, especially in smaller trials. Stratified randomization is occasionally utilized to address these potential imbalances. The EMA advises that stratification variables should typically be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically shown effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Common stratification variables used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, baseline headache intensity, migraine type (with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given that migraines predominantly affect females, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for treatment group imbalances.

- **Intention to treat**: Recommendations for randomized controlled trials of acute migraine treatments emphasize adherence to the intention to treat (ITT) principle. This principle dictates that analyses should include all randomized subjects in the groups to which they were initially assigned, regardless of the treatment they received.

### Supportive self-management program for people with chronic headaches and migraine: A randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114FTR4U]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Our population of interest were adults meeting an epidemiologic definition of chronic headaches (≥ 15 headache days per month for at least 3 months) with migraine or tension-type headaches. For reporting, we identified three phenotypes: people with ICHD-3 criteria for chronic migraine, which means at least eight days per month with a migraine attack with or without aura; less than eight migraine attacks per month, or any number of attacks meeting ICHD-3 criteria for episodic migraine and chronic tension-type headache; and chronic tension-type headache. In each group, we included those with and without medication overuse headache.

The target population for this trial was people managed in primary care, many of whom do not have a formal headache diagnosis. Diagnostic advice was part of the intervention. This fits the point in the care pathway at which this intervention would be delivered. In this study, we report on these groups together, reflecting the information needed by those who might want to commission this service in primary care. We excluded those unable to attend the group self-management sessions, without access to a telephone, not fluent in English, or unable to participate in the group intervention for health reasons.

Our original objective was to test the effectiveness of an education and self-management support program for people meeting the epidemiologic definition of chronic headaches, with its effect on people with chronic migraine and those with chronic tension-type headache and episodic migraine as a secondary analysis. However, our feasibility study found that 95% of the participants were able to complete the program successfully.

### The role of headache-related disability in migraine management: Implications for headache treatment guidelines [^1168bfSC]. Neurology (2001). High credibility.

Recently published US Headache Consortium Guidelines recommend a process of diagnosis, patient education, and individualized treatment for the management of migraine. Clinicians are advised to base their treatment choice on attack frequency and duration, degree of disability, non-headache symptoms, patient preference, and prior history of treatment response, using a stratified approach to care. In stratified care, initial treatment is individualized based on an assessment of the patients' medical needs.

One approach to stratification uses the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire to stratify patients into groups with different treatment needs based on the degree of headache-related disability. Stratified care was developed as an alternative to step-care approaches, which begin patients on nonspecific medication with gradual escalation until they obtain effective relief. Results from the Disability in Strategies for Care (DISC) study indicate that stratified care provides superior outcomes compared to step-care and that the approach is cost-effective, supporting the US Headache Consortium guidelines.

Stratified care may become the approach of choice for managing migraine in clinical practice. This approach increases the chances of providing appropriate therapy at the patient's initial consultation, sparing the patient a series of failed therapeutic efforts. The MIDAS Questionnaire provides a practical tool for helping to implement the recommendations of the US Headache Consortium guidelines.

### New players in the preventive treatment of migraine [^116XxVGG]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Do we need novel migraine preventive treatments? Although there are many approved and unapproved preventive treatments for migraine, they are often insufficient to manage migraineurs effectively, even in the right hands. Issues of efficacy, tolerance, safety, adherence, pharmacophobia, and nocebo response all suggest the need for better treatments.

There are several outcome measures used in clinical trials to qualify the efficacy of migraine prevention. The most common is a decrease in migraine or headache days per month compared to baseline, and the proportion of responders to the treatment, defined as those patients reporting more than a 50% decrease in migraine days per month following a given treatment (the 50% responder rate). The number needed to treat (NNT; defined as the number of patients who need a specific treatment to prevent one additional bad outcome, e.g. a migraine attack) for responders varies from 4–6 in several randomized trials for migraine prevention, indicating that 4–6 patients suffering from migraine must be treated for one to reach a 50% decrease in migraine days per month.

The decrease in migraine days per month after extracting the placebo effect varies from 1.2–1.8. This absolute improvement, not including the placebo effect that indeed exists and improves treatment outcomes in real life, looks very small; there is clearly room for improvement. There is also evidence that migraineurs are very sensitive to adverse events (AEs) of preventive medications and more likely to withdraw from treatment because of AEs in comparison.

### Paediatric migraine: Evidence-based management and future directions [^115hun9k]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is prevalent in children and adolescents and constitutes an important cause of disability in this population. Early, effective treatment of paediatric migraine is likely to result in improved outcomes. Findings from the past few years suggest that a biopsychosocial approach that uses interdisciplinary multimodal care is most effective for the treatment of migraine in the paediatric population. Key elements of this management include effective and timely acute pharmacological interventions (such as NSAIDs and/or triptans), education of patients regarding self-management techniques, and psychological interventions such as biofeedback, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioural therapy.

The efficacy of pharmacological or nutraceutical interventions for migraine prevention in children and adolescents is unclear, although reported placebo response patterns suggest that the effect of pill-taking behaviour is positive. As such, clinicians can consider adding a preventive intervention that involves a daily pill-taking behaviour to evidence-based non-pharmacological first-line preventive interventions (such as cognitive-behavioural therapy).

More rigorous research is needed to delineate the role of pharmacological and nutraceutical interventions, the mechanisms of the clinically relevant placebo response, and interventions that enhance this response for migraine prevention in this population. Given the prevalence of migraine, cost-effective and efficacious strategies are needed for the large-scale delivery of interdisciplinary multimodal paediatric migraine care.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: A position statement of the International Headache Society [^115mnxxc]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Preventive treatment

Migraine has a highly variable expression over time, and its natural course typically includes spontaneous improvements and regressions. Therefore, preventive treatment might be paused following a certain time period to determine whether the post-treatment pattern of migraine attacks (frequency and severity) warrants continuation of the preventive therapy. There are, however, very few randomized studies investigating termination or continuation of migraine preventive therapy.

A response to preventive treatment of migraine can be assumed if patients experience:

- **Reduced monthly migraine days (MMDs)**: i) A reduction in mean MMDs of at least 50% in patients with episodic migraine or at least 30% in patients with chronic migraine relative to the pre-treatment baseline confirmed by diary documentation or healthcare provider attestation.

- **Improvement on assessment scales**: ii) A clinically meaningful improvement on the Migraine Disability Assessment (≥ 5 points for baseline 11–20 or ≥ 30% for baseline > 20); Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (≥ 5 points); or Headache Impact Test (≥ 2.5–6 points).

The recommended duration of treatment for the prevention of migraine attacks is at least 3 months. Efficacy evaluations should be based on comparisons of the baseline assessment (4 weeks prior to start) with data from the last 4 weeks of the 3-month (12-week) treatment period. Termination of preventive treatment should be recommended to patients if a response is not achieved after 3 months for most migraine preventive drugs and 6 months for onabotulinumtoxinA and CGRP mAbs.

- **Stopping rules and implementation**:

	- Medications and neuromodulatory devices used for the acute treatment of migraine are considered ineffective if they do not demonstrate a significant difference or non-inferiority from a comparator on the endpoints of pain freedom or headache response (pain intensity from severe or moderate to mild or no pain) 2 hours after dosing (lack of response). After an initial response to acute treatment (i.e. at 2 hours), headache pain of moderate or severe intensity may return within 24 to 48 hours (i.e. relapse). Treated migraine attacks characterized by a lack of response at 2 hours or relapse within 24 to 48 hours after treatment may be regarded as treatment failure. However, before a decision is made to stop using a particular treatment, three attacks should be treated, and it should be confirmed that the treatment was appropriately administered (e.g. adequate dosage and time of administration). Cessation of an acute treatment should be considered if a lack of response or relapse occurs in more than one of the three attacks.

### Comparative effects of drug interventions for the acute management of migraine episodes in adults: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113qhBDW]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Results on both benefits and harms should inform shared clinical decision-making, considering the preferences of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. Our findings should help inform future guidelines and updates to recommendations to ensure that patients receive optimal care. Overall, the results of our network meta-analysis suggest that the best performing triptans should be considered the treatment of choice for migraine episodes due to their capacity for inducing rapid and sustained pain freedom, which is of key importance for people with migraine.

While the recent introduction of lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant has expanded options for the acute treatment of migraine, the high cost of these newer drugs, along with the substantial adverse effects of lasmiditan, suggest their use as third-line options. These should only be considered after the less expensive, similarly efficacious, second-line options such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac potassium, almotriptan, and frovatriptan.

However, the ranking of treatments in clinical guidelines extends beyond efficacy, tolerability, safety, and acquisition costs alone and must also consider cost-effectiveness, of which analyses are warranted, and accessibility. The inclusion of the most effective triptans (available as generic drugs) into the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines should be considered to promote global accessibility and uniform standards of care. Currently, sumatriptan is the only triptan included.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116SMwLE]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

In 1991, the Clinical Trials Standing Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS) published the first edition of the guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Its goal was to improve the quality of controlled clinical trials in migraine by encouraging the use of scientifically robust methods in clinical research. To keep pace with developments in the scientific and clinical understanding of acute treatment, the committee published a second edition of the guidelines in 2000 and a third edition in 2012. The commitment to continuous improvement has been recognized; the guidelines were considered in the 2018 guidance for industry prepared by the Division of Neurology Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they were adopted by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in a 2016 concept paper that represented an important milestone in its formal revision of the 2007 guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of migraine.

Since the 2012 update, multiple new acute treatments have been developed, including small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, serotonin (5-HT 1F) receptor agonists, triptan reformulations, and neuromodulation approaches. Accordingly, the guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition incorporate data from clinical trials conducted since the third edition of the guidelines was published, as well as feedback from meetings.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: A position statement of the International Headache Society [^113ymzAS]. Cephalalgia (2021). High credibility.

The Clinical Trials Subcommittee of the International Headache Society presents the first health technology assessment for the acute treatment of migraine attacks and prevention of migraine. Health technology assessments are systematic evaluations of the properties, effects, and consequences of healthcare technologies. This position statement is designed to inform decision-makers about access to and reimbursement for medications and devices for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. This position statement extends beyond the already available guidelines on randomized controlled trials for migraine to incorporate real-world evidence and a synthetic approach for considering multiple data sources and modeling methods when assessing the value of migraine treatments.

### Current practice and future directions in the prevention and acute management of migraine [^1136rLZy]. The Lancet Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling brain disorder with a strong inherited component. Because patients with migraine experience severe and disabling attacks, usually in the form of headaches accompanied by sensory disturbances (e.g. light and sound sensitivity), medical treatment is often required.

- **Acute attack therapies**: Patients can be managed using simple analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or specific agents with vasoconstrictor properties such as triptans or ergot derivatives. Future non-vasoconstrictor approaches include calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists.

- **Preventive therapy**: This is probably indicated in about a third of patients with migraine, with a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical options available.

- **Medication overuse**: It is an important concern in migraine therapeutics and needs to be identified and managed.

In most patients, careful attention to the details of therapy can improve migraine. For those in whom it cannot, neuromodulation approaches such as occipital nerve stimulation are currently being actively studied and offer much promise.

### Migraine: Preventive treatment [^1114kAYC]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes both acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference.

Start the drug at a low dose and ensure each treatment receives an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs, and re-evaluate therapy regularly. It is important that women of childbearing potential are aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance and consider co-morbidity when choosing a treatment. Select a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease.

Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Migraine: From pathophysiology to treatment [^117NZkem]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

The last two decades have been an incredibly exciting period for clinicians and researchers interested in migraine, as there has been a rapid increase in studies that have led to a greater knowledge and understanding of the neurobiology of the disorder. From suffering with a condition that was often overlooked and under-managed, migraineurs are now being offered novel treatments that are more tailored to their needs and are fundamentally reshaping our approach to the disease.

More research and progress are needed and expected in the coming years, and it is hoped that this will continue to raise awareness around a complex phenomenon affecting millions of people worldwide.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine [^113ifG9D]. Cephalalgia (2025). High credibility.

We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116A1wCN]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The need for neuroimaging is primarily to confirm or exclude causes of secondary headache that are suspected based on red flags in the medical history and/or physical examination. Otherwise, neuroimaging is rarely necessary in the diagnostic work-up of migraine and can be harmful due to exposure to ionizing radiation. When needed for investigation of possible secondary headache disorders, MRI is preferred to CT as it offers a higher resolution and does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation. However, MRI can reveal clinically insignificant abnormalities (such as white matter lesions, arachnoid cysts, and meningiomas), which can alarm the patient and lead to further unnecessary testing.

- **Recommendations**: Take a careful medical history, applying the ICHD-3 criteria. Use validated diagnostic aids and screening tools, such as headache diaries, the three-item ID-Migraine questionnaire, and the five-item Migraine Screen Questionnaire. Consider differential diagnoses, including other primary headache disorders and secondary headache disorders. Use neuroimaging only when a secondary headache disorder is suspected.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^114XM8MB]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of literature, and the consensus statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology.

In this consensus statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### New migraine drugs: A critical appraisal of the reason why the majority of migraine patients do not receive an adequate medication [^112cnqgv]. Cephalalgia (2024). Low credibility.

The last three decades have produced several novel and efficient medications to treat migraine attacks and reduce attack frequency. Additionally, promising approaches for the development of acute therapy and migraine prophylaxis continue to be pursued. At the same time that we witness the development of better and more efficient medications with continuously fewer side effects, we also realize that the high cost of such therapies means that only a minority of migraine patients who could benefit from these medications can afford them. Furthermore, information on cost-effectiveness is still lacking.

Here, we compare available data, highlight open questions, and suggest trials to close knowledge gaps. With good reason, our medicine is evidence-based. However, if this evidence is not collected, our decisions will continue to be based on marketing and assumptions. At the moment, we are not doing justice to our patients.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116cNEue]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

- **Headache relief**: Recommendations suggest that headache relief, defined as the decrease in headache pain from moderate or severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours after treatment and before taking any rescue medication (refer to Section 1.2.11), should be used as a secondary efficacy measure. For parenteral treatments, a time point before 2 hours after treatment can be used.

- **Comments**: Headache relief should be an outcome measure but only as a secondary endpoint, mainly to facilitate the comparison of results of new clinical trials with previous programs. Since headache relief is associated with the relief of disability, it is used in clinical trials as a proxy for pain improvement and restoration of function. It is also useful for comprehensive cost of treatment analyses. In older acute migraine clinical trials, headache relief at 2 hours after treatment was used extensively as a primary efficacy outcome. This was based on the suggestion that patients may consider an acute treatment effective while residual headache pain persists. However, evidence challenges the validity of this argument, showing that patients do not consider a reduction from moderate to mild headache pain as success; they expect freedom from pain. Additionally, the assumption that the magnitude of change from severe pain to no pain is clinically equivalent to the change from moderate to mild pain is incorrect.

### Practice guideline update summary: Pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^116wsq5D]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for migraine, particularly in pediatric and adolescent patients, the AAN/AHS 2019 guidelines recommend discussing the evidence for using amitriptyline combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for migraine prevention. It is important to inform patients of the potential side effects of amitriptyline, including the risk of suicide, and to collaborate with families to identify providers who offer this type of treatment.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of preventive treatment of chronic migraine in adults [^1156gfPa]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Quality clinical trials form an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for Controlled Trials of Drugs in Migraine. In 2008, the committee published the first specific guidelines on chronic migraine. Subsequent advances in drug, device, and biological development, as well as novel trial designs, have created a need for a revision of the chronic migraine guidelines.

The present update is intended to optimize the design of controlled trials of preventive treatment of chronic migraine in adults, and its recommendations do not apply to trials in children or adolescents.

### What do patients want from acute migraine treatment [^1165nRCC]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical observations have shown that migraine is a progressive disorder, both within an acute attack and within the disease itself. The rates of diagnosis for migraine have increased in the last decade; however, more than half of migraineurs remain undiagnosed. Patients' expectations of migraine therapies have also increased, as they require rapid and sustained pain relief with treatments that have good tolerability. These expectations can differ greatly from those of physicians. Management decisions should be made with these expectations in mind to enhance patient outcomes and compliance with treatment.

Improved understanding of acute migraine attack pathophysiology has led to the strategy of early treatment to modify both the progression of the attack and, potentially, the progression of the disease itself in the individual. Triptans are effective acute migraine therapies, with each agent having its own distinct profile of efficacy and tolerability, enabling the individualization of treatment.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^1165RaQb]. Cephalalgia (2019). High credibility.

- **Frequency of attacks**: Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than one day per month. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

	- **Comments**: A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that individuals with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on the consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

- **Duration of migraine**: Migraine should be present for at least one year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

	- **Comments**: There are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the one-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria. A minimum duration of one year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician records.

### Acute treatment patterns in patients with migraine newly initiating a triptan [^113b9LKr]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic neurological disease characterized by often incapacitating symptoms, such as headache pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea. It significantly impacts health-related quality of life, disability, productivity losses, and health care costs. Acute treatments for migraines are administered during an attack, with goals of rapidly alleviating pain, restoring normal function, and minimizing the use of rescue medications. These treatments are categorized into migraine-specific treatments, such as triptans and ergots, and non-specific treatments, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, and caffeinated analgesic combinations. Emerging migraine-specific acute therapies include gepants (ubrogepant and rimegepant) and ditans (lasmiditan).

Triptans, a class of migraine-specific acute treatments acting as selective serotonin receptor (5-HT1b/d) agonists, include almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan (oral, nasal spray, injectable), and zolmitriptan (oral and nasal spray). Triptans have long been recommended by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) as an initial therapy for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine attacks. They are commonly used, with approximately half of patients receiving any prescription acute medications for migraine reporting the use of a triptan. Furthermore, the recent American Headache Society (AHS) Consensus Statement recommends the trial of at least two oral triptans before switching to a different medication.
