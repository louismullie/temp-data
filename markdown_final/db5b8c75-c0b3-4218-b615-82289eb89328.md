assess diverticulitis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to assess acute colonic diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial evaluation and diagnostic uncertainty. Then, I should verify the imaging strategy and how it changes in older or special populations. Next, I will classify disease severity and confirm how that drives outpatient versus inpatient management, including the selective use of antibiotics. After that, I should examine interventional thresholds for abscesses and surgical pathways. Then, I need to review colonoscopy after an acute episode and the approach to persistent symptoms. Finally, I will consider prevention, special populations, prognosis, controversies, and integrate an algorithmic summary with appropriate evidence checks throughout [^117Sp1JW] [^116J9tGy] [^116eW5Uz].

> Let me first confirm the clinical presentation and the limits of a purely clinical diagnosis. Classic features include left lower quadrant pain, localized tenderness, fever, and bowel habit changes, but clinical diagnosis alone misses a meaningful fraction of cases with sensitivity near two thirds, which means I should not over-rely on exam and history alone, especially in older adults or those on steroids where signs can be blunted [^116Pk4R4] [^111gm4sy] [^114zvV3k]. I should double-check the role of labs as rule-in or rule-out tools; CRP is often elevated and a CRP greater than 10 mg/L shows high sensitivity but poor specificity, and very early presentations may have normal CRP that peaks by 48 hours, so normal labs do not exclude disease and should not falsely reassure me when suspicion is high [^115Ez54s] [^114NaBpF]. Hold on, I should verify guidance on when to image; the ACP advises abdominal CT imaging when diagnostic uncertainty exists, which in practice is common given the nonspecificity of clinical and laboratory findings [^117Sp1JW].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy and confirm CT as the reference standard. CT with intravenous contrast is the primary modality because it is highly accurate for both diagnosis and delineation of complications such as abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction, and it informs downstream management choices, so I should maintain a low threshold to obtain CT when the diagnosis is uncertain or the patient is systemically ill [^117Sp1JW] [^111gm4sy]. Wait, let me verify special considerations in older adults; multi-society WSES guidance suggests CT with IV contrast for suspected diverticulitis in patients older than 65 years given atypical presentations and higher complication risks, while MRI, ultrasound, or CT without contrast may be considered when contrast is contraindicated, which I should keep in mind in those with severe CKD or contrast allergy [^115r1miC] [^116eW5Uz] [^1147tTh1]. I should also acknowledge that ultrasound can perform well in expert hands with pooled sensitivity and specificity above 0.9, but it is operator dependent and may be less reliable for mapping complications, reinforcing CT's central role when management hinges on precise staging [^115Ez54s].

> Now, I will classify severity because management pivots on whether disease is uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated disease refers to localized inflammation without abscess, perforation, fistula, stricture, or obstruction, whereas complicated disease includes any of those features, and this distinction drives whether conservative outpatient care or interventional approaches are needed [^116J9tGy] [^1153t1tA]. Hold on, I should verify a potential inconsistency about small abscesses; I initially stated that any abscess means complicated disease, but some radiology texts describe small pericolic collections in the spectrum of early inflammation, which can create confusion, so to avoid misclassification I will adhere to guideline definitions that count any abscess as complicated and use CT-based schemes like Hinchey or WSES classifications to standardize severity assessment and guide treatment [^111MoAL8] [^1119REbF] [^1155LA3q]. I need to ensure I note that CT features such as free air or free fluid portend a more severe course and should prompt inpatient management and early surgical or IR consultation [^1173agNw].

> I should now decide on the care setting and supportive measures. For immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease who are well appearing, have pain controlled, can tolerate oral intake, have reliable follow-up, and have no complications on imaging, outpatient management is appropriate and commonly preferred, and initial conservative care without routine antibiotics is reasonable in mild cases, though I need to confirm that careful safety netting is in place [^117Sp1JW] [^111wzpRm]. Let me double-check supportive care; a clear liquid diet advanced as symptoms improve and appropriate analgesia are recommended during the acute phase, and I should reassess within 48–72 hours to verify stabilization or improvement [^115kUeHR]. But wait, what about those who need admission; systemic symptoms, peritonitis, sepsis, uncontrolled pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, immunocompromise, significant comorbidity, or unreliable follow-up should prompt inpatient care and early imaging-based staging to detect complications requiring intervention, with a lower threshold to admit frail older adults [^116J9tGy] [^114RpCze].

> Next, I should review antibiotic strategy and avoid reflexive overuse. For acute uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients, multiple trials and synthesis reports show no clear outcome benefit of routine antibiotics versus selective use, so I should reserve antibiotics for those with significant systemic features, escalating symptoms, or comorbid risk, while ensuring close follow-up to catch non-responders early [^112zVg3K] [^117Sp1JW]. I need to check that this does not apply to complicated disease or immunocompromised hosts; in those settings, antibiotics are always indicated with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic organisms, following local stewardship, and I should avoid prolonged courses after effective source control because evidence does not support benefit from extension [^111n8N9t] [^111PGekX].

> I will now examine interventional management thresholds. Let me first confirm the abscess pathway; percutaneous drainage is generally recommended for abscesses larger than about 4 cm, for collections not responding to antibiotics, or with clinical deterioration, recognizing that drainage succeeds in roughly 80 percent with low complication rates, and that prolonged antibiotics after adequate source control are not supported by evidence [^111n8N9t]. Hold on, I should verify surgical indications and choice; emergency surgery is required for free perforation with peritonitis or uncontrolled sepsis, while elective resections should be individualized rather than driven by episode counts, and when operating for complicated disease without sepsis, resection with primary anastomosis is often favored if colorectal expertise is available, with Hartmann's reserved for septic, frail, or immunocompromised patients [^116J9tGy] [^115LGLrm] [^112kFaKo].

> Next, I should review follow-up colonoscopy and not over-test after straightforward recovery. Routine colonoscopy after CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis is generally not recommended because the contemporaneous cancer risk is low and high-quality CT can exclude malignancy in the absence of suspicious features, though I should still perform age-appropriate screening if due and reserve diagnostic colonoscopy for complicated cases, high-risk CT features, or persistent symptoms [^111PGekX] [^114t85AT] [^112vPifB]. I should double-check that guideline recommendations are not fully uniform; some societies previously recommended routine colonoscopy for all, but more recent positions from AGA and WSES support selective strategies, which I should reconcile by anchoring on CT features and clinical course rather than a blanket rule [^113uymya] [^116eW5Uz].

> If chronic symptoms persist after an acute episode, I need to ensure I rule out ongoing inflammation. I should obtain imaging and lower endoscopy to exclude active diverticulitis or alternative pathology, and if negative, consider visceral hypersensitivity and manage along those lines rather than repeatedly treating as infection or inflammation, which avoids unnecessary antibiotics and procedures [^116V4vdC] [^111oYCq8]. Wait, let me verify that this approach aligns with the initial presentation; if red flags develop or new alarm features emerge, I should revisit the imaging and endoscopic assessment rather than attributing symptoms to functional mechanisms prematurely [^116J9tGy].

> I will now consider evidence-based secondary prevention. Patients should be advised to maintain a high-quality, fiber-rich diet, achieve or maintain a normal BMI, engage in regular physical activity, stop smoking, and avoid regular NSAID use except for aspirin in secondary cardiovascular prevention, as these factors are associated with reduced recurrence risk, and I should incorporate this into routine counseling after recovery [^112onW6f] [^116J9tGy]. Hold on, I should double-check diet myths; avoiding nuts, popcorn, or seeds is not recommended because evidence does not support increased risk with these foods, so I should correct that misconception explicitly during counseling [^1135Rqvq]. I need to ensure patients also understand that genetics contribute to risk, which contextualizes lifestyle recommendations and sets realistic expectations for recurrence prevention [^116J9tGy].

> Special populations warrant tailored thresholds and strategies. In older adults, I should avoid relying solely on clinical signs and labs because of atypical presentations and instead use cross-sectional imaging liberally, often CT with IV contrast, while favoring admission and antibiotics at lower severity thresholds in frailty or when systemic features are present, especially given higher morbidity and mortality risks in this group [^116eW5Uz] [^114zvV3k] [^114RpCze]. I should confirm that immunocompromised patients are managed more aggressively, with antibiotics even for uncomplicated disease and a lower threshold for hospitalization and intervention, whereas in early-onset disease the incidence of complicated presentations appears to be rising, but colectomy rates have fallen with greater use of interventional radiology, so core principles remain similar while resource use patterns evolve [^111PGekX] [^114g5iDB].

> I should now appraise prognosis and risk stratification to guide counseling. Recurrence after an uncomplicated episode is lower than historically taught, with some contemporary cohorts showing approximately 1.7 percent over five years, and complicated recurrence after an initially uncomplicated episode is rare, so I should set expectations accordingly while emphasizing that the first episode often carries the highest complication risk [^112dv6ua] [^113W39B9]. Let me consider emerging tools; polygenic risk scores have shown associations with both occurrence and severity and may eventually refine individualized risk discussions, and evolving microbiome evidence links pro-inflammatory taxa and metabolomic signatures to diverticulitis risk, although these are not yet practice-changing and should not supplant standard risk assessment [^113UAEam] [^1176jJ9T].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without acknowledging controversies and evidence gaps. There is persistent debate around routine antibiotics in uncomplicated disease, optimal antibiotic duration when used, timing and indications for elective surgery, and the necessity of colonoscopy after recovery, reflecting that many recommendations are conditional and of low or very low certainty using GRADE, so I should practice shared decision-making and document rationale when choices are preference-sensitive [^117Sp1JW] [^112H69fh] [^113uymya]. I should double-check that my local protocols align with stewardship and guideline-consistent care while remaining flexible to patient-specific factors that guidelines cannot fully capture [^111wPfNc].

> Integrating this into a practical algorithm, I should triage first for instability, sepsis, or peritonitis and obtain urgent CT with IV contrast and surgical or IR consultation if present, while in stable patients I should use CT to confirm diagnosis when uncertainty exists or when older age, immunocompromise, or severe pain increase the risk of occult complications, then manage uncomplicated cases outpatient with supportive care and selective antibiotics and complicated cases with admission, antibiotics, and interventional or surgical management as indicated, followed by selective colonoscopy and preventive counseling after recovery, with close follow-up and reassessment for non-responders [^117Sp1JW] [^111PGekX] [^111n8N9t]. Let me emphasize safety netting; early reassessment within 48–72 hours is critical to detect trajectory changes that would trigger escalation of care, imaging, or intervention [^111PGekX].

> In summary, I need to ensure a CT-driven, risk-stratified approach that prioritizes outpatient, conservative management with selective antibiotics for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease, prompt recognition and intervention for complications, individualized decisions for elective surgery, selective colonoscopic evaluation post-episode, and robust lifestyle and education strategies for secondary prevention, with special attention to older and immunocompromised patients who require lower thresholds for imaging, admission, and antibiotics [^111wPfNc] [^117Sp1JW] [^111PGekX]. I should confirm that shared decision-making and clear safety netting are documented, given the conditional nature of much of the evidence and the variability in patient values and clinical trajectories [^112H69fh].

Diverticulitis is best assessed by **CT with IV contrast** [^115r1miC] to confirm diagnosis [^117Sp1JW], stage severity, and guide management, especially in elderly or atypical cases [^116eW5Uz] [^116tsXBK]. Uncomplicated cases can often be managed outpatient [^117Sp1JW] with **selective antibiotics** [^111oYCq8] and a **clear liquid diet** [^115kUeHR], while complicated cases require **hospitalization**, **broad-spectrum antibiotics** [^111n8N9t], and possible **percutaneous drainage** or **surgery** [^111n8N9t] [^1153t1tA]. Colonoscopy is recommended 6–8 weeks after resolution to exclude malignancy [^112vPifB], and lifestyle measures (high-fiber diet, normal BMI, physical activity, no smoking, avoid NSAIDs) help reduce recurrence [^111PGekX] [^116J9tGy].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

Typical symptoms include **left lower quadrant pain**, fever [^116NTdEV], leukocytosis, and altered bowel habits [^1118dtuU]. Risk factors include age, low-fiber diet, obesity, physical inactivity [^112onW6f], smoking, and **NSAID use** [^116J9tGy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Initial evaluation includes a **history** [^116NTdEV], **physical examination**, and **laboratory tests (CBC, CRP)** [^115Ez54s]. However, **clinical assessment alone is insufficient** [^114zvV3k], particularly in elderly patients [^116eW5Uz].

---

### Imaging modalities

CT scan is the **gold standard** [^115r1miC], offering high sensitivity and specificity [^112zVg3K] and defining severity and complications [^111MoAL8]. Ultrasound or MRI are **alternatives** when CT is contraindicated or unavailable [^1147tTh1] [^115Ez54s].

---

## Classification of diverticulitis

Diverticulitis is classified as **uncomplicated or complicated** based on clinical and imaging findings:

| **Category** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated | Localized inflammation without abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction [^116NTdEV] [^115egEyg] |
| Complicated | Presence of abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction [^116NTdEV] [^1153t1tA] |

---

## Management strategies

### Uncomplicated diverticulitis

- **Outpatient management**: Appropriate for stable patients without severe comorbidities [^111oYCq8] [^117Sp1JW].
- **Antibiotics**: Selective use [^111oYCq8]; not routine in immunocompetent patients [^111PGekX].
- **Diet**: Clear liquids during acute phase [^111PGekX], advance as symptoms improve [^115kUeHR].

---

### Complicated diverticulitis

- **Hospitalization**: Required [^1153t1tA] for abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction [^111n8N9t].
- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria [^111n8N9t].
- **Interventions**: Percutaneous drainage for abscesses > 4 cm; surgery for severe complications [^111n8N9t] [^1153t1tA].

---

## Follow-up and prevention

Colonoscopy is recommended **6–8 weeks** after resolution to exclude malignancy [^112vPifB] [^111PGekX]. Lifestyle modifications — including a high-fiber diet, normal BMI, physical activity [^112onW6f], smoking cessation, and **avoidance of regular NSAIDs** — are advised [^116J9tGy].

---

## Complications and recurrence

Complications include abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction [^116NTdEV], and **sepsis** [^1153t1tA]. Recurrence is **common** [^111oYCq8] and managed with lifestyle changes and individualized care [^111wPfNc].

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

Atypical presentations are **more common**, with a **higher risk of complications** [^116eW5Uz] [^114RpCze]. A lower threshold for imaging is **recommended** for elderly patients [^115r1miC] [^116eW5Uz].

---

## Emerging trends and controversies

Antibiotic use is **selective** [^111oYCq8] in uncomplicated cases, though debate continues [^117Sp1JW]. Elective surgery should be **individualized** [^115ypMkE] based on severity, patient preferences, and quality of life [^115LGLrm].

---

Diverticulitis assessment relies on **CT imaging** [^117Sp1JW] [^112zVg3K] to confirm diagnosis and guide management, with outpatient care for uncomplicated cases [^111oYCq8] and hospitalization for complicated disease [^111n8N9t]. Colonoscopy after resolution [^112vPifB] and lifestyle changes help prevent recurrence [^112onW6f] [^116J9tGy].

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

- **Statement**: There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis. Antibiotics are indicated in all complicated acute diverticulitis cases. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved.

- **Recommendation**: Our expert panel recommended that antibiotic use covers gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria based on institutional protocols and antibiotic stewardship principles (LoE: very low; Strength of recommendation: strong).

- **Membership survey results**: Yes, 767 (99.1%).

644 members (83.2%) agreed that this recommendation was already their practice; 67 (8.66%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice, while 63 (8.14%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

- **Statement**: Percutaneously drained abscesses > 4 cm successfully resolved in 80% of patients with a low complication and re-intervention rate.

- **Recommendation**: Our expert panel recommends that percutaneous drainage be considered for larger abscesses, those that do not resolve on antibiotics, and/or in the presence of patient deterioration (LoE: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

- **Membership survey results**: Yes, 655 (86.3%).

540 members (71.15%) agreed that this recommendation was already their practice; 78 (10.28%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice, while 141 (18.58%) disagreed that it was.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this clinical practice update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for the management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices.

In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on their history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy.

Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first episode.

### Clinical and CT findings in appendiceal diverticulitis [^112nEh1Q]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Appendiceal diverticulitis is a rare pathological entity that poses diagnostic challenges on clinical grounds due to its indolent course and atypical presenting symptoms. However, the characteristic computed tomographic (CT) features should suggest the correct diagnosis, prompting an appendectomy. Despite its rarity, radiologists should be cognizant of this condition and its CT findings because it carries a higher risk of perforation compared to appendicitis and may be associated with appendiceal neoplasms.

### Computed tomography in the imaging of colonic diverticulitis [^111gm4sy]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis occurs when diverticula within the colon become infected or inflamed. It is becoming an increasingly common cause for hospital admission, particularly in Western society, where it is linked to a low-fiber diet. Symptoms of diverticulitis include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and pyrexia; however, symptoms are often non-specific, and the clinical diagnosis may be difficult. Additionally, elderly patients and those taking corticosteroids may have limited findings on physical examination, even in the presence of severe diverticulitis. A high index of suspicion is required in such patients in order to avoid a significant delay in arriving at the correct diagnosis.

Imaging plays an important role in establishing an early and correct diagnosis. In the past, contrast enema studies were the principal imaging test used to make the diagnosis. However, such studies lack sensitivity and have limited success in identifying abscesses that may require drainage. Conversely, computed tomography (CT) is both sensitive and specific in making a diagnosis of diverticulitis. Additionally, it is the imaging technique of choice in depicting complications such as perforation, abscess formation, and fistulae. CT-guided drainage of diverticular abscesses helps to reduce sepsis and to permit a one-stage, rather than two-stage, surgical operation.

The purpose of this review article is to discuss the role of CT in the imaging of diverticulitis, describe the CT imaging features and complications of this disease, as well as review the impact and rationale of CT imaging and intervention in the diagnosis and management of colonic diverticulitis.

### Diagnostic imaging for diverticulitis [^112a3mck]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The misdiagnosis rate of diverticulitis based solely on clinical and laboratory criteria is high. Given the potential severity of diverticulitis and its complications, early and routine radiologic evaluation is recommended. Imaging is used to establish the diagnosis and its extent and severity, and to detect the presence of any complications so that management can be directed appropriately.

The most widely used examinations for the diagnosis of diverticulitis are ultrasound, barium enema, computed tomography (CT), and recently, magnetic resonance imaging. Over the past decade, CT has replaced barium enema mainly because of its ability to identify extracolonic extent of disease. CT scan remains the procedure of choice in the acute, symptomatic stage. Nevertheless, diverticulitis often remains a clinical diagnosis; thus, communication between the clinician and the radiologist remains imperative to facilitate effective testing.

### Meta-analysis of the role of colonoscopy after an episode of left-sided acute diverticulitis [^112vPifB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Two authors independently searched PubMed and Embase databases for studies published up to April 2018. They used search terms including diverticulitis, diverticular, colonoscopy, colonic evaluation, colon cancer, colon carcinoma, colorectal cancer, colorectal carcinoma, sigmoid cancer, and sigmoid carcinoma. Additionally, a manual cross-reference search of relevant articles' reference lists was performed to identify other studies not found in the initial search. No language limits were applied. MOOSE guidelines for reporting were followed. A review protocol for this systematic review was not published or registered before the study commenced.

- **Study selection**: Eligible studies included RCTs or observational cohort studies of patients with CT-proven acute colonic diverticulitis, reporting rates of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) or colorectal carcinoma found at colonoscopy. Only patients who underwent colonoscopy within one year of the acute diverticulitis diagnosis were included. This criterion was set to assess the risk of having a colorectal carcinoma at the time of acute diverticulitis diagnosis, rather than the risk of developing colorectal carcinoma unrelated to acute diverticulitis occurring several years later. Studies of Western origin that did not quantify the number of patients with right-sided diverticulitis were included, based on the assumption that the vast majority of cases in the Western world are left-sided, usually above 90 percent.

### Acute diverticulitis — clinical presentation and differential diagnostics [^116Pk4R4]. Colorectal Disease (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe the clinical presentation of acute diverticulitis in an emergency department and to characterize the natural history of diverticulitis in the short term. Comparisons are made with an important differential diagnosis, nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP).

- **Method**: Patients admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain of up to seven days' duration were registered prospectively using a detailed schedule for history, symptoms, and signs, from February 1, 1997, to June 1, 2000. Of the 3349 patients initially included, 3073 (92%) were eligible for follow-up after 1 to 3 years.

- **Results**: Acute diverticulitis was the final diagnosis in 145 patients and NSAP in 1142 patients. The incidence of hospitalized patients with diverticulitis was 47 per year per 100,000 population, with a mean hospital stay of 3.3 days. Patients with diverticulitis had a longer history and laboratory signs of inflammatory activity more frequently than those with NSAP. Isolated left abdominal tenderness was more common in diverticulitis, whereas isolated right abdominal tenderness was more common in NSAP. Duration of symptoms on arrival was independent of age and was not correlated to C-reactive protein, leukocytes, or body temperature. The sensitivity of diverticulitis as a primary diagnosis was 64%, and specificity was 97%. Corresponding figures for NSAP were 43% and 90%, respectively. Age and gender did not influence diagnostic accuracy or risk of surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Diverticulitis differs significantly from NSAP in clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. The sensitivity of primary diagnosis for diverticulitis showed marked distinctions from NSAP.

### Emergency medicine updates: Acute diverticulitis [^115XUUdp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

- **Objective**: This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

- **Discussion**: Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Change in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**

### Gut microbiome composition and metabolic activity in women with diverticulitis [^1149eFjn]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

The etiopathogenesis of diverticulitis, among the most common gastrointestinal diagnoses, remains largely unknown. By leveraging stool collected within a large prospective cohort, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling among 121 women diagnosed with diverticulitis requiring antibiotics or hospitalizations (cases), matched to 121 women without diverticulitis (controls) according to age and race. Overall microbial community structure and metabolomic profiles differed in diverticulitis cases compared to controls, including enrichment of pro-inflammatory *Ruminococcus gnavus*, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, and histidine-related metabolites, and depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory ceramides. Through integrated multi-omic analysis, we detected covarying microbial and metabolic features, such as *Bilophila wadsworthia* and bile acids, specific to diverticulitis. Additionally, we observed that microbial composition modulated the protective association between a prudent fiber-rich diet and diverticulitis. Our findings offer insights into the perturbations in inflammation-related microbial and metabolic signatures associated with diverticulitis, supporting the potential of microbial-based diagnostics and therapeutic targets.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Ez54s]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

The literature search yielded 3,230 studies, from which we included seventeen studies involving a total of 5,227 adults with suspected acute diverticulitis. Among these, 1,470 (28%) had diverticulitis. We contacted five authors for additional data and received data from one.

Fifteen studies included patients prospectively, and two studies included patients retrospectively. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (twelve studies, N = 4,372, 510 cases). The remaining studies were conducted in Asia (two studies, N = 283, 86 cases) and North America (three studies, N = 672, 282 cases). The prevalence of acute diverticulitis in these populations ranged from 11% to 65% (median 48%, IQR 37–58). All studies were performed in secondary care settings, with the majority taking place in emergency departments (eight studies, N = 3,511, 881 cases). Four studies were conducted in radiology departments (N = 433, 233 cases), two in surgery departments (N = 976, 166 cases), and in three studies, the department was not mentioned (N = 407, 190 cases). Fifteen studies used multiple reference standards, typically a combination of clinical outcomes, surgery, CT, follow-up, and clinical experts. Two studies used CT alone.

- **Risk of bias**: Table 1 presents the risk of bias in the included studies. Ten studies were assessed as demonstrating a high risk of bias in at least one domain, while fourteen studies scored an unclear risk of bias in one or more domains. High risk of bias in the domain of patient selection was related to inappropriate exclusions in two studies.

### Gut microbiome composition and metabolic activity in women with diverticulitis [^1176jJ9T]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The etiopathogenesis of diverticulitis, among the most common gastrointestinal diagnoses, remains largely unknown. By leveraging stool collected within a large prospective cohort, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling among 121 women diagnosed with diverticulitis requiring antibiotics or hospitalizations (cases), matched to 121 women without diverticulitis (controls) according to age and race.

Overall, microbial community structure and metabolomic profiles differed in diverticulitis cases compared to controls, including enrichment of pro-inflammatory Ruminococcus gnavus, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, and histidine-related metabolites, and depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory ceramides. Through integrated multi-omic analysis, we detected covarying microbial and metabolic features, such as Bilophila wadsworthia and bile acids, specific to diverticulitis. Additionally, we observed that microbial composition modulated the protective association between a prudent fiber-rich diet and diverticulitis.

Our findings offer insights into the perturbations in inflammation-related microbial and metabolic signatures associated with diverticulitis, supporting the potential of microbial-based diagnostics and therapeutic targets.

### Colonic diverticulitis: A prospective analysis of diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making [^111otgSN]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical evaluation and cross-sectional imaging modalities such as ultrasound and computed tomography for patients with suspected colonic diverticulitis and to determine the value of these examinations in clinical decision-making, a prospective analysis was conducted involving 802 consecutive patients who presented with abdominal pain at the emergency department. Initial clinical diagnoses and management proposals were compared to the final diagnoses and therapeutic strategies for all patients.

Fifty-seven patients were identified with colonic diverticulitis as the final diagnosis. The positive and negative predictive values for the clinical diagnosis of colonic diverticulitis were 0.65 and 0.98, respectively. Additional cross-sectional imaging demonstrated a positive and negative predictive value of 0.95 and 0.99 or higher, respectively. These additional examinations led to a correct change of the initial clinical diagnosis in 37% of the patients and a change in management in only 7%.

The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis for colonic diverticulitis is low. Ultrasound and computed tomography have superior diagnostic accuracy, but these examinations rarely change the initial management proposal.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^112H69fh]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The study aimed to analyze the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis, and thereby to design questions for future research.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those less than 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines. The highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient if it met the Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher, or insufficient otherwise.

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, consensus was reached in 13 topics, while 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence, and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment, and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^1153t1tA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is one of the most common clinical conditions encountered by surgeons in the emergency setting. An international multidisciplinary panel of experts from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) updated its guidelines for the management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (ALCD) according to the most recent available literature. The update includes recent changes introduced in the management of ALCD. Furthermore, the update has been integrated with advances in acute right-sided colonic diverticulitis (ARCD), which is more common than ALCD in select regions of the world.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^114NaBpF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The expert panel states that in very acute onset disease, CRP values might not have risen yet, as there is a delay of 6–8 hours from the onset of the disease, reaching a peak at 48 hours. Therefore, caution should be used in using low CRP as excluding out acute diverticulitis.

### EAES rapid guideline: surgical management of complicated diverticulitis - with ESCP participation [^112kFaKo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

The surgical management of complicated diverticulitis varies across Europe. EAES members prioritized this topic to be addressed by a clinical practice guideline through an online questionnaire.

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations for key stakeholders involved in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis, aiming to improve operative and perioperative outcomes, patient experience, and quality of life through a systematic evidence-to-decision approach by a diverse, multidisciplinary panel.

- **Methods**: Informed by a linked individual participant data network meta-analysis of resection and primary anastomosis (PRA) versus Hartmann's resection (HR) versus laparoscopic lavage (LPL), a panel of general and colorectal surgeons, patient partners, trialists, and fellows appraised the certainty of the evidence using GRADE and CINeMA. The panel discussed the evidence using the evidence-to-decision framework during a synchronous consensus meeting. An asynchronous modified Delphi survey was used to establish consensus.

- **Results**: The panel suggests that patients with complicated diverticulitis without sepsis receive PRA over HR or LPL when a surgeon with skills and experience in colorectal surgery is available. HR is suggested over PRA or LPL in the subgroups of septic, frail, as well as immunocompromised patients. These recommendations apply to patients with an indication for surgery. Surgeons and patients should first consider conditionally recommended interventions, then conditionally recommended against. Based on the evidence, the…

### Small bowel diverticulitis: An often overlooked cause of acute abdomen [^1122uTKm]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

We present three cases of small bowel diverticulitis that ultimately presented to our Emergency Department over a span of two years. Although the final diagnosis was the same, each patient's symptomatology differed, mimicking more common pathologies. Therefore, it is important to consider this entity when confronted with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen, especially in the elderly. A missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to costly erroneous studies, incorrect treatments, and delays in proper management, resulting in significant morbidity and even mortality.

The variety of presentations can often be misleading; therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed on the part of the Emergency Department physician and radiologist.

### The WSES/SICG/ACOI/SICUT/AcEMC/SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^1147tTh1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute diverticulitis, especially in elderly patients, the ACOI/AcEMC/SICG/SICUT/SIFIPAC/WSES 2022 guidelines recommend considering ultrasound, MRI, or CT without intravenous contrast as alternative diagnostic approaches. This is particularly suggested for elderly patients with suspected diverticulitis who are unfit for CT with IV contrast, such as those with severe acute or chronic kidney disease or a contrast allergy.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ny5bK]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Recognition of acute diverticulitis is important to determine an adequate management strategy. Differentiating it from other gastrointestinal disorders is challenging as symptoms overlap. Clinical tests might assist the clinician with this diagnostic challenge. Previous reviews have focused on prognostic questions and imaging examinations in secondary care.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests feasible in primary care for acute diverticulitis in suspected patients.

- **Method**: We have systematically searched multiple databases for diagnostic accuracy studies of tests feasible in primary care compared to a reference standard in suspected patients. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality with the QUADAS-2 tool. We have meta-analyzed the results in the case of more than four studies per index test.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies were included, all conducted in secondary care (median prevalence 48%). Individual signs and symptoms showed a wide range in sensitivity (range 0.00–0.98) and specificity (range 0.08–1.00). Of the four laboratory tests evaluated, CRP > 10 mg/l had the highest sensitivity (range 0.89–0.96) with specificity ranging from 0.28 to 0.61. Ultrasound had the highest pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.86–0.96) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.88–0.97), respectively.

- **Conclusion**: None of the studies were performed in primary care. Individual signs and symptoms alone are insufficiently informative for acute diverticulitis diagnosis. CRP showed potential for ruling…

### Diverticular disease in the primary care setting [^117UXD7v]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease is a chronic and common condition, yet its impact in primary care remains largely unknown. The diagnosis of diverticular disease relies on demonstrating diverticula in the colon, but the necessary investigations are often unavailable in primary care. The specificity and sensitivity of symptoms, clinical signs, and laboratory tests are generally low, resulting in a diagnostic process characterized by uncertainty. Furthermore, the criteria for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease in the absence of macroscopic inflammation are not clearly defined. Consequently, both the prevalence of diverticular disease and the incidence of diverticulitis in primary care are unknown.

Recommendations for the treatment and follow-up of patients with acute diverticulitis are based on studies where the diagnosis is verified by computerized tomography. These results cannot be directly applied to primary care, where diagnosis must rely on the interpretation of symptoms and signs. Therefore, one must account for greater diagnostic uncertainty and ensure safety netting in case of unexpected developments in the condition, which is an important aspect of managing diverticulitis in primary care.

The highest prevalence of diverticular disease is observed among older patients, where multimorbidity and polypharmacy are common. The challenge is to consider the possible contribution of diverticular disease to the patient's overall condition and to anticipate its implications in terms of advice and treatment, particularly in relation to other diseases.

### CT findings of misleading features of colonic diverticulitis [^1118nNH9]. Insights into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis (CD) is a common condition primarily diagnosed through computed tomography (CT) examination, the preferred imaging technique. However, unusual CT findings in CD may lead to various difficulties and potential pitfalls. These issues can arise due to technical errors during CT examinations, the anatomical position of the diseased colon, and in diagnosing unusual complications that may affect the gastrointestinal tract, intra- and retroperitoneal viscera, or the abdominal wall. Additionally, challenges may occur in distinguishing CD from other abdominal inflammatory and infectious conditions or colonic cancer. The aim of this work is to delineate the pitfalls of CT imaging and illustrate misleading CT features in patients with suspected CD.

### CT of jejunal diverticulitis: Imaging findings, differential diagnosis, and clinical management [^111HGWoi]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to describe the imaging findings of jejunal diverticulitis as depicted at contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and to review the differential diagnosis and clinical management.

- **Materials and methods**: CT and pathology databases were searched for the diagnosis of jejunal diverticulitis. Three cases were identified, and the imaging and clinical findings were correlated.

- **Results**: Jejunal diverticulitis presents as a focal inflammatory mass involving the proximal small bowel. A trial of medical management with antibiotics may be attempted. Surgical resection may be required if medical management is unsuccessful.

- **Conclusion**: The imaging findings at MDCT may allow a specific diagnosis of jejunal diverticulitis to be considered and may affect the clinical management of the patient.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^116KvfG7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition frequently encountered by primary care practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It can often be diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### A proposal for a CT-driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^1119REbF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the most appropriate diagnostic tool to confirm suspected left colonic diverticulitis. However, the utility of CT imaging goes beyond accurate diagnosis of diverticulitis; the grade of severity on CT imaging may drive treatment planning for patients presenting with acute diverticulitis.

The appropriate management of left colon acute diverticulitis remains debated due to the vast spectrum of clinical presentations and the different approaches to treatment proposed. The authors present a new, simple classification system based on CT scan results that drive decision-making in the management of acute diverticulitis, potentially providing a universally accepted approach for day-to-day practice.

### International, expert-based, consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis [^115egEyg]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This Delphi study provides consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research.

- **Objective**: To generate an international, expert-based consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was conducted using the Delphi technique from April 3 through October 21, 2014. A survey website was used, and a panel of acute diverticulitis experts was formed via the snowball method. The top five acute diverticulitis experts in five international geographic regions were identified based on their number of publications related to acute diverticulitis.

- **Interventions**: The Delphi study used three rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: A consensus statement related to the management of acute diverticulitis.

- **Results**: Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following three rounds of questioning. A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients, as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies. A number of important topics, including antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. In addition, consensus was reached regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in complicated diverticulitis.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis.

### A clinical and radiological comparison of sigmoid diverticulitis episodes 1 and 2 [^113UTfsx]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

After an initial uncomplicated attack, sigmoid diverticulitis may recur, but the morphological characteristics of recurrent diverticulitis have not been investigated. We compared the clinical and radiological severity, respective location, and clinical outcome of the first two episodes of sigmoid diverticulitis.

We reviewed the charts of 60 patients with a median age of 61 years (range: 31–90 years), who were admitted initially for a first episode of uncomplicated left colonic diverticulitis and were eventually readmitted for a second episode. Both episodes were documented by abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan.

The median delay between the two episodes was 19 months (range: 3–97 months). Six patients (10%) developed a second complicated episode of diverticulitis: Hinchey II (n = 2), treated with CT-guided percutaneous drainage; Hinchey III (n = 3), treated with emergency Hartmann's operation; and colovesical fistula (n = 1), treated with elective sigmoid resection. Fifty-four patients (90%) were admitted for a second episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Within this group, the duration of hospital stay [11 days (range: 4–22) vs. 10 days (range: 1–39), P = 0.28], serum levels of C-reactive protein [131 mm (range: 31–350) vs. 112 mm (range: 22–333), P = 0.62], and CT scan-based severity score [3 points (range: 1–6) vs. 3 points (range: 0–7), P = 0.07] were similar between the two episodes. In 19 out of 54 patients (35%) with simple recurrent diverticulitis, the disease severity was similar, but the disease topography differed, with recurrence involving another segment of the left colon.

The majority of patients who develop recurrence do so in a similar modality and location.

### United States guidelines for diverticulitis treatment [^114jzNeW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for diverticular disease management were last supported and published by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American College of Gastroenterology two decades ago. While guidelines have been published in other countries and by some societies, these are suggested as United States of America guidelines. In reality, they reflect practices at Yale New Haven hospitals in Connecticut.

The epidemiology and pathophysiology of diverticulitis are described. It is still considered a dietary fiber-deficiency disease that results in high intracolonic pressure, leading to the outpocketing of diverticula at the weakest points of the colon, specifically at sites of vascular penetration where elastin deposition develops in the colon wall. The associated age and gender distribution indicates they are most common in the sigmoid colon.

Guidelines for management are described according to the accepted classification of the disease at all stages, from onset to early formation, mild disease, complicated disease, and rare specific states. Lastly, the outcomes and mortality associated with diverticulitis are discussed.

### Is colonoscopy still mandatory following a CT diagnosis of left-sided diverticulitis: can colorectal cancer be confidently excluded [^11447Y3V]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

It is routine practice to perform colonoscopy as a follow-up after an attack of diverticulitis, with the main aim to exclude any underlying malignancy.

- **Purpose**: This study aimed to determine whether colonoscopy is necessary and what additional information is gained from this procedure.

- **Design**: This is a study of a retrospective cohort.

- **Settings and patients**: From January 2003 to June 2009, patients in whom left-sided diverticulitis was diagnosed on CT scan were matched with colonoscopy reports within one year from the date of CT by the use of radiology and endoscopy databases. Patients who had colonoscopy within one year before the CT scan were excluded. The Western Australian Cancer Registry was cross-referenced to identify patients who subsequently received diagnoses of cancers for whom colonoscopy reports were unavailable.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were the number of patients in whom colorectal cancers were diagnosed and other incidental findings, for example, polyps, colitis, and stricture.

- **Results**: Left-sided diverticulitis was diagnosed in 1088 patients on CT scan, whereas follow-up colonoscopy reports were available for 319 patients. Eighty-two (26%) patients had incidental findings of polyps (9 polyps > 1 cm), and 9 patients (2.8%) received diagnoses of colorectal cancers on colonoscopy. After cross-referencing with the cancer registry, the overall prevalence of colorectal cancer among the cohort within one year of CT scan was 2.1% (23 cases). The odds of a diagnosis of colorectal cancer were 6.7 times (95% CI 2.4–18.7) in patients with an ab.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^1166R1SB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Several radiological and clinical approaches are currently available to classify diverticular disease (DD). Surprisingly, an endoscopic classification of the disease is still lacking, considering the high number of colonoscopies performed in our centers and the percentage of signs of diverticular inflammation detected by colonoscopy in everyday practice. Selecting patients according to colonic characteristics may be an option to increase therapeutic efficacy. To this end, an endoscopic classification of DD has been recently developed and validated.

This classification, called Diverticular Inflammation and Complications Assessment (DICA), assesses four main items: diverticulosis extension, number of diverticula in each district, presence of inflammation, and presence of complications. It also considers some sub-items, scoring the disease in three grades: DICA 1, DICA 2, and DICA 3. Preliminary retrospective data found that this classification can predict the outcome of the disease according to the severity of the score.

In simpler terms, simple and/or asymptomatic diverticulosis does not seem to require maintenance treatment to prevent complications. In contrast, a colon with signs of inflammatory attack may be unresponsive to maintenance treatment for preventing the recurrence of complications. Interestingly, DICA 2 appears to respond very well to scheduled treatment, as symptomatic diverticulosis with or without signs of inflammation responds effectively to maintenance treatment for prevention of occurrence.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^112dv6ua]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis usually have an indolent course with a low incidence of subsequent complications. The majority of patients successfully respond to outpatient management. Inpatient treatment with bowel rest and IV antibiotics is recommended for those with persistent abdominal pain that does not improve with outpatient antibiotic therapy. Recently, the use of antibiotics in mild episodes of the disease has been questioned. A randomized controlled trial from Europe found no difference in recurrence or development of complications after one year in those treated with antibiotics versus those who did not receive them. Clinical judgment remains an important aspect of managing acute diverticulitis and determining the resolution of acute inflammation.

Recurrence of acute diverticulitis is lower than previously thought. It is frequently reported that about one-third of all patients with acute diverticulitis will have a reattack, often within one year. However, recurrence after an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis has recently been shown to be much lower, with one prospective study reporting a recurrence of only 1.7% over five years of follow-up. Notably, a complicated recurrence after recovery from an uncomplicated episode is very rare, a finding demonstrated in multiple studies.

The guidelines for elective sigmoid colectomy for uncomplicated diverticulitis have changed. The decision to proceed with elective resection should no longer be based solely on the number of episodes.

### Recurrent diverticulitis [^115eHDHh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The term "diverticulitis" indicates the inflammation of a diverticulum or diverticula, which is accompanied by detectable or microscopical perforation. Diverticulitis is a common condition with an estimated incidence of 25%. At present, elective sigmoid resection is recommended after two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis to prevent serious complications of recurrent colonic diverticulitis. This guideline has been based on the assumption that two or more episodes of diverticulitis will lead to complicated diverticulitis and higher mortality. The data to support this assumption are based on only a few small studies.

Advances in diagnostic modalities, medical therapy, and surgical techniques over the past two decades have changed both the management and outcomes of diverticulitis. Many authors have shown that patients treated non-operatively have a low risk of recurrent disease and are expected to do well without elective colectomy.

### Diagnostic imaging and medical management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: A systematic review [^112zVg3K]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Clinicians need to better understand the value of computed tomography (CT) imaging and nonsurgical treatment options to manage acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate CT imaging, outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotic treatment, and interventional radiology for patients with complicated diverticulitis.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 January 1990 through 16 November 2020.

- **Study selection**: Existing systematic reviews of CT imaging accuracy, as well as randomized trials and adjusted nonrandomized comparative studies reporting clinical or patient-centered outcomes.

- **Data extraction**: Six researchers extracted study data and risk of bias, which were verified by an independent researcher. The team assessed strength of evidence across studies.

- **Data synthesis**: Based on moderate-strength evidence, CT imaging is highly accurate for diagnosing acute diverticulitis. For patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, six studies provide low-strength evidence that initial outpatient and inpatient management have similar risks for recurrence or elective surgery, but they provide insufficient evidence regarding other outcomes. Additionally, for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, five studies comparing antibiotics versus no antibiotics provide low-strength evidence that does not support differences in risks for treatment failure, elective surgery, recurrence, post-treatment complications, and other outcomes.

### A clinical decision rule to establish the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis at the emergency department [^111riQtJ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to identify patients in whom the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis can be made with high certainty, distinguishing them from patients requiring imaging.

- **Methods**: We prospectively recorded clinical features in patients with acute abdominal pain presenting at the emergency department before they underwent imaging. We identified features significantly associated with a final diagnosis of acute diverticulitis using multivariate logistic regression analysis and developed a decision rule based on these features. We evaluated the performance of the rule in identifying patients with a high probability of having diverticulitis.

- **Results**: In total, 112 of the 1,021 patients (11%) had a final diagnosis of diverticulitis. Of the 126 patients with clinically suspected diverticulitis, 80 had a final diagnosis of diverticulitis. In 32 patients with diverticulitis as their final diagnosis, another clinical diagnosis was made. A decision rule was based on the three strongest clinical features: direct tenderness only in the left lower quadrant, the absence of vomiting, and a C-reactive protein > 50 mg/L. Of the 126 clinically suspected patients, 30 patients had all three features (24%), of whom 29 had a final diagnosis of acute diverticulitis (97%; 95% CI: 83%-99%). Of the 96 patients without all three features, 45 (47%) did not have diverticulitis.

- **Conclusion**: In a quarter of patients with suspected diverticulitis, the diagnosis can be made clinically based on a combination of direct tenderness only in the left lower quadrant, the absence of vomiting, and an elevated C-reactive protein level.

### Current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis: A systematic review [^114QbyhZ]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

This paper addresses the status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis through an evidence-based review.

- **Method**: A systematic search was conducted in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar focusing on colonic diverticulitis. The review included diagnostic tools, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparative studies, observational epidemiological studies, national and international guidelines, and reviews of observational studies on elective and emergency surgical treatment of diverticulitis, as well as studies of prognostic significance. Criteria for study eligibility included diagnosis and classification, medical treatment, inpatient and outpatient care, diverticulitis in young patients, immunosuppression, recurrence, elective resection, emergency surgery, and predictive factors.

- **Results**: A total of 92 publications were selected for comprehensive review. The review highlighted that computed tomography is the most effective test for diagnosing and staging acute diverticulitis. Outpatient treatment is suitable for uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients without associated comorbidities. Conservative treatment targets patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Elective surgery should be decided on an individual basis. Although appropriate, a laparoscopic approach for elective treatment of diverticulitis may be technically complex. In cases of perforated diverticulitis, resection with primary anastomosis is a safe procedure that requires experience and must consider strict exclusion criteria.

The heterogeneous nature of patients with colonic diverticulitis presents challenges for treatment standardization.

### How would you manage this patient with recurrent diverticulitis? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^115jfupo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis, which refers to inflammation or infection, or both, of a colonic diverticulum, is a common medical condition that may occur repeatedly in some persons. It most often manifests with left-sided abdominal pain, which may be associated with low-grade fever and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Complications may include abscess, fistula formation, perforation, and bowel obstruction. The American College of Physicians recently published practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis, the role of colonoscopy after resolution, and interventions to prevent recurrence of this condition. Among the recommendations were the use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning in cases where there was diagnostic uncertainty, initial management of uncomplicated cases in the outpatient setting without antibiotics, referral for colonoscopy after an initial episode if not performed recently, and discussion of elective surgery to prevent recurrence in patients with complicated diverticulitis or frequent episodes of uncomplicated disease. Here, two gastroenterologists with expertise in acute diverticulitis debate CT scanning for diagnosis, antibiotics for treatment, colonoscopy to screen for underlying malignancy, and elective surgery to prevent recurrence.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: A review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^116NTdEV]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with diverticulitis typically present with abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, nausea, and low-grade fevers. Diagnosis and management hinge upon distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated disease. Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is defined as isolated colonic inflammation in the setting of diverticulosis. Complicated diverticulitis encompasses a spectrum of disease from microperforation (localized specks of extraluminal air) to free perforation with stool throughout the abdomen (feculent peritonitis). Abscess, stricture, and fistula are also considered complicated diseases.

Patients with complicated diverticulitis may present with more severe systemic symptoms, peritonitis, obstruction (secondary to strictures), or symptomatic fistulae (pneumaturia, urosepsis, feculent vaginal discharge), although these findings may be more subtle in older adults as discussed below. Complicated diverticulitis is diagnosed based on symptoms and cross-sectional CT imaging.

- **Example CT images**: (A) Diverticular abscess. (B) Colovesical fistula. (C) Free air secondary to perforation. (D) Sigmoid stricture.

Accurate and timely diagnosis of diverticulitis in older adults can be challenging due to age-related physiologic changes, multimorbidity, and atypical clinical presentations. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, altered bowel habits, and signs of systemic inflammation may be less pronounced, leading to underdiagnosis and delayed treatment.

### Position paper: Management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^114t85AT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

After the inflammation from a new onset of diverticulitis has resolved, traditionally, patients have undergone colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. However, the necessity of routine colonoscopy has recently been questioned. Colonoscopy is time-consuming and burdensome on an already-stretched healthcare system. Additionally, endoscopy may be technically more difficult in these patients, with a risk of iatrogenic bowel perforation (~0.1%). The reported incidence of colon cancer in CT-diagnosed acute diverticulitis ranges from 0.5% to 3%. Technological improvements in the quality and resolution of CT scans have led to better evaluation of the colon in the affected segment, decreasing the chances of missing colon cancer.

A recent study by Sallinen et al. provides additional insight into this debate. They examined 536 patients admitted to the hospital for diverticulitis who were treated without an operation. Out of these, 394 underwent a delayed colonoscopy, and 17 (2.7%) were found to have cancer. Sixteen cancer cases (94%) had an abscess in the CT, whereas the remaining case had pericolic extraluminal air but no abscess. Among patients with an abscess, 11% had cancer mimicking acute diverticulitis. No cancer was found in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Besides abscess, other independent risk factors for cancer included suspicion of cancer by a radiologist, bowel wall thickness over 15 mm, no diverticula seen, and previously undiagnosed metastases. The study concludes that routine colonoscopy after CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis seems unnecessary.

### Cecal diverticulitis mimicking acute appendicitis: a report of 4 cases [^112pCdo6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In conclusion, preoperative diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis is important to determine the appropriate management of this condition. During the surgical procedure, if the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is in doubt, further exploration should be performed. We recommend diverticulectomy as a safe and adequate treatment for cecal diverticulitis. However, if the histopathological examination of the specimen reveals the presence of colonic cancer, a right hemicolectomy can always be performed.

### Meta-analysis of the role of colonoscopy after an episode of left-sided acute diverticulitis [^113uymya]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Several national and international guidelines [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] on acute diverticulitis have been published in recent years. The recommendations in these guidelines are conflicting, and the evidence on which they are based differs. Most of the guidelines (6 of 8) [11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18] recommend routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis to rule out malignancy, although the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [17] suggests that previous colonoscopies, comorbidities, persistent symptoms, and patients' preferences may influence the decision.

The scientific grounds for the recommendations in these six guidelines are noteworthy. The AGA [17] and German [15] guidelines are based on a previous systematic review, while two other guidelines [11, 18] used only two observational studies. An Italian guideline [13], published in 2015, stated that evidence-based data were not available. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons [14] made strong recommendations based on studies with low quality of evidence but based their recommendation for routine colonoscopy mainly on studies that assessed the risk of malignancy in a selected group of patients with signs suggestive of malignancy, such as colonic wall thickening or mass on CT scan.

Two guidelines [12, 16] recommend not performing routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis. Of these, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) [16] recommends omitting colonoscopy only in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. The fact that the AGA [17] and WSES [16] guidelines make opposite recommendations highlights the ongoing debate in the medical community.

### The WSES/SICG/ACOI/SICUT/AcEMC/SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^111mJjy8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Could the diagnosis of acute left colonic diverticulitis be based on only clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests in elderly patients?

- **Diagnosis**: In the elderly population, we suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute left colonic diverticulitis on only patient clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests [conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence]. We suggest that elderly patients presenting with abdominal guarding or pain in the lower left abdomen on physical examination undergo appropriate imaging for suspected diverticulitis, regardless of the value of leukocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP) [conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence].

As stated in the WSES guidelines for the general population, the clinical diagnosis of acute left colonic diverticulitis (ALCD) alone is not sufficiently accurate for patients with suspected diverticulitis. However, pain in the lower left abdomen, elevated temperature, and absence of vomiting could suggest a diagnosis of ALCD. The reported sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis of ALCD in the general population are 0.68 and 0.98, respectively.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: A review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^116UsKxZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

Little data exists to support the optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials involving younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any, comorbidities, outpatient management without antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults.

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults; antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

### Polygenic risk prediction in diverticulitis [^113UAEam]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The objective is to derive and validate a polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict the occurrence and severity of diverticulitis and to understand the potential for incorporation of a PRS in decision-making.

- **Background**: PRS quantifies genetic variation into a continuous measure of risk. There is a need for improved risk stratification to guide surgical decision-making that could be fulfilled by PRS. It is unknown how surgeons might integrate PRS in decision-making.

- **Methods**: We derived a PRS with 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with diverticular disease in the UK Biobank and validated this score in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). We performed a discrete choice experiment of practicing colorectal surgeons. Surgeons rated the influence of clinical factors and a hypothetical polygenic risk prediction tool.

- **Results**: Among 2812 MGI participants with diverticular disease, 1964 were asymptomatic, 574 had mild disease, and 274 had severe disease. PRS was associated with occurrence and severity. Patients in the highest PRS decile were more likely to have diverticulitis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42–2.38] and more likely to have severe diverticulitis (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04–2.51) than the bottom 50%. Among 213 surveyed surgeons, extreme disease-specific factors had the largest utility (3 episodes in the last year, +74.4; percutaneous drain, +69.4). Factors with the strongest influence against surgery included 1 lifetime episode (-63.3), outpatient management (-54.9), and patient preference (-39.6). PRS was predicted to have high utility.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for acute diverticulitis that are feasible in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QpZcK]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

- **Abstract**:

Recognition of acute diverticulitis is important to determine an adequate management strategy. Differentiating it from other gastrointestinal disorders is challenging as symptoms overlap. Clinical tests might assist the clinician with this diagnostic challenge. Previous reviews have focused on prognostic questions and imaging examinations in secondary care.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests feasible in primary care for acute diverticulitis in suspected patients.

- **Method**: We have systematically searched multiple databases for diagnostic accuracy studies of tests feasible in primary care compared to a reference standard in suspected patients. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality with the QUADAS-2 tool. We have meta-analyzed the results in the case of more than four studies per index test.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies were included, all performed in secondary care with a median prevalence of 48%. Individual signs and symptoms showed a wide range in sensitivity (range 0.00–0.98) and specificity (range 0.08–1.00). Of the four laboratory tests evaluated, CRP > 10 mg/l had the highest sensitivity (range 0.89–0.96) with specificity ranging from 0.28 to 0.61. Ultrasound had the highest pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.86–0.96) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.88–0.97), respectively.

- **Conclusion**: None of the studies were performed in primary care. Individual signs and symptoms alone are insufficiently informative for acute diverticulitis diagnosis. CRP showed potential.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^115ypMkE]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute diverticulitis, specifically in the context of elective colectomy, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend offering an individualized discussion on elective segmental resection for patients with a history of diverticulitis. This discussion should take into account disease severity, patient preferences and values, as well as the risks and benefits, including quality of life. Patients should be counseled that while surgery reduces the risk of diverticulitis, it does not eliminate it entirely, and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms may not always improve with surgical intervention.

### Acute diverticulitis: Key features for guiding clinical management [^111MoAL8]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon and small bowel is an important cause of pathology leading to emergency department visits and urgent gastrointestinal surgery. CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis and its complications, as well as for the exclusion of alternate causes of pathology. Ultrasound, MRI, and virtual CT colonoscopy have important adjunct roles for screening and workup of complications in specific patient populations.

While diverticular disease most commonly involves the descending and sigmoid colon, it can also affect the proximal colon and small bowel. Acute diverticulitis may be categorized as uncomplicated or complicated according to the degree of inflammatory changes and related complications it induces, although some degree of overlap exists in clinical practice. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is classically characterized by localized inflammation surrounding a diverticulum, ranging from wall thickening and phlegmonous change to the development of small, localized pericolic abscesses. Complicated forms of the disease manifest with larger pericolic and distant abscesses, fistulae to adjacent organs, perforation, and peritonitis.

Recurrent episodes of diverticulitis may lead to muscular hypertrophy of the bowel wall and luminal narrowing, potentially leading to bowel obstruction. Several imaging features may help to differentiate diverticulitis from colonic malignancy; however, this remains a diagnostic imaging challenge that often requires further evaluation with colonoscopy.

### National trends in hospital admissions, interventions, and outcomes for early-onset (age < 50 years) diverticulitis from 2005 to 2020 [^114g5iDB]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Low credibility.

Little is known about the burden and outcomes of diverticulitis in patients younger than 50 years. This knowledge gap hinders the development of effective management strategies and preventive measures for this population.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to analyze national trends in hospitalizations, interventions, and outcomes for early-onset diverticulitis (age younger than 50 years) in comparison to standard-onset diverticulitis (age 50 years or older) cohorts.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Settings**: A survey-weighted, national sample extracted from the National Inpatient Sample.

- **Patients**: All adults (18 years or older) hospitalized for diverticulitis between 2005 and 2020 were included.

- **Main outcome measures**: National trends in the proportions of early-onset versus standard-onset diverticulitis were found to be related, along with the rates of colectomy.

From 2005 to 2020, 5,239,735 patients were nonelectively hospitalized for diverticulitis. Of them, 837,195 (16.0%) were early onset. During the study period, the proportion of the early-onset cohort admitted for complicated diverticulitis significantly increased from 18.5% to 28.2% (nonparametric trend < 0.001). In addition, there was a decline in the proportion of early-onset diverticulitis patients needing a colectomy (34.7%-20.3%, nonparametric trend < 0.001), with a corresponding increase in the proportion of patients needing interventional radiology intervention (12.7%-28.6%, nonparametric trend < 0.001). Compared to standard-onset diverticulitis, early-onset diverticulitis was associated with…

### Diverticulitis in older adults: A review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^114RpCze]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Sigmoid or left‐sided diverticulosis (hereafter termed "diverticulosis") refers to the presence of false diverticula of the colon. Diverticulosis affects 60% of the U.S. population by age 60. Most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic; however, 10%–25% develop symptoms ranging from minor abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits to severe pain, sepsis, or diverticular bleeding. This review specifically focuses on diverticulitis, defined as inflammation centered on the diverticular orifices. The majority (85%) of individuals with diverticulitis develop uncomplicated disease, while the remaining 15% experience disease complicated by abscess, fistula, obstruction, or perforation.

Among gastrointestinal diagnoses, diverticulitis is the sixth most common cause of hospital admissions and the 11th most common cause of non‐malignant deaths in the United States. The overall incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, driven in part by the aging population in the United States. Diverticulitis increases with age, as does the number of diverticulitis-related emergency department visits. It is the fourth most common cause for emergency surgery in older adults. Older adults with diverticulitis are at higher risk of in‐hospital mortality and complications of diverticulitis and resulting surgical treatments than younger patients.

Treatment strategies for diverticulitis include observation, medical management, elective surgery, and emergency surgery. Treatment decisions for older adults require weighing symptom severity, impact on quality of life, and risks associated with surgical and non-surgical interventions.

### Triage of patients with acute diverticulitis: Are some inpatients candidates for outpatient treatment [^1173agNw]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Recommendations regarding the triage of patients with acute diverticulitis for inpatient or outpatient treatment are vague. It was hypothesized that a significant number of patients treated as inpatients could be managed as outpatients.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 639 patients admitted for a first episode of diverticulitis. The diagnosis of acute diverticulitis was confirmed through computed tomography (CT). The endpoints included length of stay, need for surgery, percutaneous drainage, and mortality. Patients were considered to have had minimal hospitalization if they survived to discharge without needing a procedure, had a hospitalization of ≤ 3 days, and no readmission for diverticulitis within 30 days after discharge.

Of the 639 patients, 368 (57.6%) had minimal hospitalization. Female gender and CT scan findings of free air/fluid were negatively associated with the likelihood of minimal hospitalization. Conversely, the presence of an abscess < 3 cm and stranding on CT did not predict the need for a higher level of care. Despite the statistical significance of several patient-level predictors, the model did not identify patients likely to need only minimal hospitalization.

Most patients admitted with acute diverticulitis are discharged after minimal hospitalization. The presence of free air/liquid in a patient admitted for acute diverticulitis indicates a more severe clinical course.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^1118dtuU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition that is frequently encountered by primary care and emergency department practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It is often diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, the presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: A review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^111gFceH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Ultimately, the decision to move forward with surgery should take into consideration multiple factors, including the risk and severity of possible recurrence, the impact of diverticulitis episodes on a patient's daily life and function, and the risks associated with an elective procedure (Figure 4). Although a severe diverticulitis recurrence may be life-threatening, understanding what matters to each patient and whether the anticipated outcomes of surgery align with their goals should primarily drive the decision.

- **Factors contributing to surgical decisions**: Factors that contribute to the decision to pursue surgical resection or continue observation in an older adult with diverticulitis include the severity of disease, patient surgical risk, and desired and acceptable outcomes.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: A review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^113gnDzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing diverticulitis requires an approach that considers atypical presentations in older adults. The 2022 European multi-society guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults provide recommendations for how to incorporate these differences into clinical practice. They suggest avoiding diagnosis based solely on exam findings or laboratory results, as this may lead to underdiagnosis. Instead, cross-sectional CT imaging with IV contrast is suggested for all patients older than 65 years with suspected diverticulitis. Obtaining a CT scan in every patient over 65 with abdominal pain and suspected diverticulitis may not be feasible, and this may be omitted in select cases with mild local symptoms and reliable close clinical follow-up. However, patients with any systemic signs, including atypical symptoms such as fatigue, renal insufficiency, chest pain, or syncope, should be evaluated with CT imaging to rule out complicated disease that may require inpatient management or procedural intervention.

Case example: A 78-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, prior stroke, obesity, COPD, and one prior episode of diverticulitis presents to clinic with three days of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, loose stools, anorexia, and fatigue. Physical exam reveals tachycardia to 105 with an irregular rhythm, fever to 38°C, and focal left lower quadrant tenderness. Her white blood cell count is 13,000 and creatinine is 1.4. Other laboratory values are normal. Given her systemic symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, in addition to her medical history, further evaluation is warranted.
