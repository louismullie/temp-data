## Question

Work up and management autism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup and management of autism spectrum disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about screening and surveillance in primary care. Then, I should verify the diagnostic evaluation process and DSM-5 criteria. Next, I will consider the etiologic workup, including genetics and when to image. After that, I need to assess co-occurring conditions and their management. Finally, I will outline evidence-based interventions, pharmacologic strategies, and transition planning, and I will close with a concise algorithm and key takeaways, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the screening and surveillance strategy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at every well-child visit and standardized ASD-specific screening at 18 and 24 months, because ASD can be identified as early as 18 months and early intervention improves outcomes; the M-CHAT-R/F is the most validated tool, with high sensitivity when used correctly, though it is not diagnostic and requires follow-up for positive screens [^55aedc44] [^97b380c9] [^d82abb1b]. Hold on, I should verify the USPSTF stance: they found insufficient evidence for universal screening in asymptomatic children, which underscores the need to pair screening with surveillance and clinical judgment rather than screening alone [^9e9a5a95].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic evaluation. Diagnosis is clinical and based on DSM-5 criteria, requiring persistent deficits in social communication/interaction across contexts and at least two restricted, repetitive behaviors, with onset in early development and functional impairment; severity is rated by support needs, not as a quantitative score, and coexisting conditions should be specified [^40ead0b9] [^12b6a2e1] [^e6347eb6]. Wait, let me verify the process: a comprehensive assessment should include a detailed developmental history, direct observation, and standardized tools such as ADOS-2 when available, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce delays [^75fe4482] [^7ca3cd23].

> I will now examine the etiologic workup. I need to ensure I prioritize chromosomal microarray as first-line genetic testing because it has the highest diagnostic yield among non-targeted tests, followed by fragile X testing and consideration of MECP2 in girls; whole-exome sequencing is reasonable if initial tests are unrevealing and suspicion remains high, and all families should be counseled that genetic testing may explain etiology but is not diagnostic of ASD itself [^5cb87c6d] [^31cba0fd] [^f75a6962]. Hold on, I should verify the yield figures: community data show CMA yield around 24%, which aligns with genetics guidance, though yield varies with phenotype and cohort [^af36c7ca].

> Let me consider neuroimaging and other tests. Routine brain MRI is not indicated for all children with ASD; MRI should be reserved for red flags such as microcephaly, macrocephaly, seizures, atypical regression, focal deficits, or suspected neurogenetic syndromes, and EEG is not routine without concern for seizures or atypical regression, though families should be educated about seizure risk and signs [^ea64dd20] [^ccb1fc4f]. I should double-check metabolic testing: routine metabolic panels are low yield and should be guided by history, family history, and exam; hair or urine heavy metal testing is not recommended outside of standard lead screening [^51d14706].

> Next, I should review co-occurring conditions and their management. ADHD co-occurs in roughly half of children with ASD and warrants careful assessment and individualized treatment, including behavioral strategies and, when needed, stimulants or alpha-2 agonists, recognizing different response profiles in ASD; anxiety and depression are common and should be treated with evidence-based psychosocial interventions first, with SSRIs considered cautiously when indicated [^86599006] [^60a1a360] [^3c58dfa5]. For sleep problems, melatonin is first-line and effective with minimal adverse effects, ideally combined with behavioral sleep interventions; for severe irritability or aggression unresponsive to behavioral approaches, risperidone or aripiprazole can be considered with close monitoring for metabolic and neurologic adverse effects [^a9f5750f] [^27e29a9c] [^239bae86]. I need to ensure I address GI symptoms pragmatically: evaluate and treat constipation, reflux, and feeding issues using standard pediatric approaches, integrating behavioral strategies when needed, and consider celiac disease only when clinically indicated [^559f4d27] [^209bd7a5].

> Now, I should outline evidence-based interventions. Early intensive behavioral intervention, particularly applied behavior analysis and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, improves cognitive, language, and adaptive outcomes; speech-language therapy targeting pragmatics, occupational therapy for sensory and adaptive needs, and social skills training are key components, and parent-mediated interventions enhance generalization [^e389756c] [^49fa5504]. Wait, let me verify intensity and timing: starting before age 3 and delivering at least 20–25 hours per week of active, structured intervention is associated with better outcomes, though access and intensity vary by region and payer [^notfound].

> I need to ensure pharmacologic strategies are framed correctly. There is no medication that treats core ASD symptoms, so medications are used for co-occurring conditions or problem behaviors after functional behavioral assessment and nonpharmacologic strategies; shared decision-making with families is essential to align treatment with goals and values [^4410b5a1]. Hold on, I should verify the monitoring plan: for antipsychotics, track weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipids at baseline and periodically, and reassess efficacy and adverse effects regularly [^notfound].

> Next, I should review transition planning. Adolescents with ASD require proactive planning for adult medical, behavioral health, education, and vocational services; pediatricians should begin transition discussions by age 14, coordinate with adult providers, and connect families with resources such as Ticket to Work and vocational rehabilitation programs to support employment and independence [^7e88a10d] [^f20e93d0]. I should confirm that transition plans are individualized and updated annually, incorporating legal, residential, and guardianship considerations as appropriate [^7e88a10d].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. Screen at 18 and 24 months with M-CHAT-R/F plus ongoing surveillance; if positive or concerns arise, refer promptly for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation using DSM-5 criteria and multidisciplinary input; once diagnosed, offer genetic counseling and testing with CMA and fragile X, reserve MRI/EEG for indicated scenarios, assess for co-occurring ADHD, anxiety, depression, sleep, GI, and seizures, and initiate evidence-based behavioral and educational interventions; consider medications only for specific co-occurring symptoms after behavioral strategies, and start transition planning in early adolescence [^55aedc44] [^75fe4482] [^5cb87c6d] [^e389756c] [^7e88a10d]. But wait, what if the family declines genetic testing? I should counsel on recurrence risk, potential benefits of etiologic diagnosis, and that testing does not change the ASD diagnosis, documenting shared decision-making and revisiting testing if new symptoms emerge [^4e294c6e] [^fdbedd62].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check this conclusion: early identification via surveillance and screening, timely multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation, a stepwise but comprehensive etiologic workup with CMA first-line, proactive management of co-occurring conditions, and early, intensive, evidence-based behavioral interventions are the pillars of best practice; prognosis is improved with earlier intervention and higher baseline cognitive and language abilities, though diagnostic stability is high even when identified in toddlerhood [^f9ceec06] [^e389756c]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal screening efficacy; while AAP supports it, USPSTF highlights evidence gaps, so clinical judgment and family engagement remain critical to avoid both under- and over-diagnosis [^9e9a5a95] [^55aedc44].

The workup for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is **clinical**, using DSM-5 criteria and standardized tools (M-CHAT-R/F, ADOS-2) [^40ead0b9] [^97b380c9] [^f635b1fb], with a **multidisciplinary assessment** of cognition, language, and adaptive function [^9c760218]. Routine labs are not diagnostic; **genetic testing** (CMA, fragile X) is offered to all families for etiology and counseling, and MRI/EEG are reserved for specific indications [^5cb87c6d] [^ea64dd20] [^ccb1fc4f]. Management is **individualized**, combining behavioral interventions (ABA, EIBI, social skills training) [^e389756c] [^49fa5504], speech/occupational therapy, and school-based supports [^9affa858]; medications target co-occurring symptoms (irritability, anxiety, ADHD, sleep) [^4410b5a1] [^239bae86] [^3c58dfa5] [^a9f5750f]. Early identification and intervention improve outcomes, and care should be coordinated with families and across providers [^f9ceec06] [^7e88a10d].

## Diagnostic workup

### Clinical assessment

- **DSM-5 criteria**: Persistent deficits in social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive behaviors, with onset in early development and functional impairment [^40ead0b9] [^b9a1873c].
- **Multidisciplinary evaluation**: Cognitive, language, and adaptive assessments by psychology, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy [^9c760218] [^ed276f04].
- **Standardized tools**: M-CHAT-R/F for screening; ADOS-2 and ADI-R for diagnosis [^97b380c9] [^f635b1fb].

---

### Medical evaluation

- **Physical exam**: Growth, head circumference, dysmorphic features, neurologic exam [^5cb87c6d].
- **Hearing screening**: Rule out hearing loss as a cause of language delay [^af36c7ca].
- **Genetic testing**: CMA and fragile X for all; WES if indicated [^5cb87c6d] [^31cba0fd].
- **Neuroimaging/EEG**: Only if seizures, regression, or focal deficits are suspected [^ea64dd20] [^ccb1fc4f].

---

## Management

### Behavioral and educational interventions

- **Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)**: ABA-based programs to improve cognitive, language, and adaptive outcomes [^e389756c] [^49fa5504].
- **Social skills training**: Structured groups to enhance peer interaction and communication [^notfound].
- **Parent-mediated interventions**: Teach families to implement strategies at home [^notfound].
- **School-based supports**: IEP/504 plans, speech/language therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral supports [^e389756c].

---

### Pharmacologic management

Medications target co-occurring symptoms, not core ASD features; **risperidone or aripiprazole** are first-line for severe irritability/aggression after behavioral strategies fail [^239bae86] [^4410b5a1]. SSRIs may be used cautiously for anxiety or depression, and **melatonin** is first-line for sleep problems, often with behavioral strategies [^3c58dfa5] [^a9f5750f] [^5999701a]. Stimulants or atomoxetine are considered for clinically significant ADHD symptoms [^notfound].

---

### Addressing co-occurring conditions

Co-occurring conditions are common and should be actively managed: **GI symptoms** (constipation, reflux, feeding issues) are treated with standard pediatric approaches plus behavioral strategies [^559f4d27] [^209bd7a5]. Seizures are managed per neurology, and **mental health conditions** (anxiety, depression, ADHD) are treated with evidence-based behavioral and pharmacologic interventions [^ccb1fc4f] [^60a1a360] [^3c58dfa5].

---

### Family support and coordination of care

Family support and care coordination are essential: **parent training** builds capacity and reduces stress, and **care coordination** integrates medical, educational, and community services [^7e88a10d]. Families should also be connected with **support groups** and respite services [^7e88a10d].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis varies with **cognitive ability, language skills, and intervention intensity**; early, intensive intervention improves outcomes [^f9ceec06] [^2e0efda5]. Follow-up should be **regular**, monitoring development, behavior, and co-occurring conditions, with **transition planning** starting in adolescence to adult services [^7e88a10d].

---

The workup for ASD is **clinical**, with genetic testing and targeted studies as indicated, and management is **multidisciplinary**, emphasizing behavioral interventions, family support, and coordinated care to maximize function and quality of life.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children — American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report — notes a U.S. prevalence of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%) and that core deficits are identified in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child's function and quality of life. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — stepwise genetic etiologic investigations (Table 8): Step 1, consider referral for pediatric genetics evaluation. Step 2, obtain a comprehensive history including 3-generation family history and perform physical examination with growth parameters (including head circumference) and skin examination; if syndrome diagnosis or metabolic disorder is suspected, go back to step 1 and/or order the appropriate targeted testing, otherwise proceed to step 3. Step 3, laboratory studies include discuss and offer CMA analysis, discuss and offer fragile X analysis with referral to genetics for additional testing if family history is suggestive of sex-linked intellectual disabilities, and if patient is a girl, consider evaluation for Rett syndrome, MECP2 testing; if these studies do not reveal the etiology, proceed to step 4. Step 4, consider referral to genetics; workup might include WES.

### Clinical genetics evaluation in identifying the etiology of autism spectrum disorders [^f7f993c3]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The autism spectrum disorders are a collection of conditions, which have, in common, impaired socialization and communication in association with stereotypic behaviors. The reported incidence of autism spectrum disorders has increased markedly over the past decade. In addition, a large amount of attention has been paid to these conditions among lay and professional groups. These influences have resulted in a marked increase in the number of referrals to clinical geneticists for evaluation of persons with autism spectrum disorders. The primary role of the geneticist in this process is to define etiology, if possible, and to provide counseling and contribute to case management based on the results of such investigations. In deciding upon the appropriate evaluation scheme for a particular patient, the geneticist must consider a host of different factors. Such considerations would include (1) Assuring an accurate diagnosis of autism before proceeding with any investigation. (2) Discussing testing options, diagnostic yields, and patient investment before proceeding with an evaluation. (3) Communication and coordination with the patient's medical home. (4) Assessing the continuously expanding and evolving list of available laboratory testing modalities in light of evidence-based medicine. (5) Recognizing expanded phenotypes of well-described syndromic and metabolic conditions that encompass autism spectrum disorders. (6) Defining an individualized evaluation scheme based on the unique history and clinical features of a given patient. The guidelines in this article have been developed to assist the clinician in the consideration of these factors.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^b300c46e]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with reported prevalence in the United States of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%). Core deficits are identified in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior. Children and youth with ASD have service needs in behavioral, educational, health, leisure, family support, and other areas. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. More accurate and culturally sensitive screening approaches are needed. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child's function and quality of life. There is an increasing evidence base to support behavioral and other interventions to address specific skills and symptoms. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions. This single clinical report updates the 2007 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical reports on the evaluation and treatment of ASD in one publication with an online table of contents and section view available through the American Academy of Pediatrics Gateway to help the reader identify topic areas within the report.

### Recent advances in understanding and managing autism spectrum disorders [^7d8567d8]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder in children is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by difficulties with social communication and behavior. Growing scientific evidence in addition to clinical practice has led the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to categorize several disorders into the broader category of autism spectrum disorder. As more is learned about how autism spectrum disorder manifests, progress has been made toward better clinical management including earlier diagnosis, care, and when specific interventions are required. The 2014 Neurobiology of Disease in Children symposium, held in conjunction with the 43rd annual meeting of the Child Neurology Society, aimed to (1) describe the clinical concerns involving diagnosis and treatment, (2) review the current status of understanding in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder, (3) discuss clinical management and therapies for autism spectrum disorder, and (4) define future directions of research. The article summarizes the presentations and includes an edited transcript of question-and-answer sessions.

### Clinical genetics evaluation in identifying the etiology of autism spectrum disorders: 2013 guideline revisions [^3cc98b18]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The autism spectrum disorders are a collective of conditions that have in common impaired socialization and communication in association with stereotypic behaviors. The reported incidence of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically over the past two decades. In addition, increased attention has been paid to these conditions by both lay and professional groups. These trends have resulted in an increase in the number of referrals to clinical geneticist for the evaluation of persons with autism spectrum disorders. The primary roles of the geneticist in this process are to define etiology when possible, to provide genetic counseling, and to contribute to case management. In deciding on the appropriate evaluation for a particular patient, the geneticist will consider a host of factors: (i) ensuring an accurate diagnosis of autism before proceeding with any investigation; (ii) discussing testing options, diagnostic yields, and family investment before proceeding with an evaluation; (iii) communicating and coordinating with the patient-centered medical home (PCMH); (iv) assessing the continuously expanding and evolving list of available laboratory-testing modalities in light of the published literature; (v) recognizing the expanded phenotypes of well-described syndromic and metabolic conditions that overlap with autism spectrum disorders; and (vi) defining an individualized evaluation plan based on the unique history and clinical features of a given patient. The guidelines in this paper have been developed to assist the clinician in the consideration of these factors. It updates the original publication from 2008. Genet Med 2013:15(5):399–407.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in individuals with ASDs: a consensus report [^f3b9b26e]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common and clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders. Gastrointestinal disorders and associated symptoms are commonly reported in individuals with ASDs, but key issues such as the prevalence and best treatment of these conditions are incompletely understood. A central difficulty in recognizing and characterizing gastrointestinal dysfunction with ASDs is the communication difficulties experienced by many affected individuals. A multidisciplinary panel reviewed the medical literature with the aim of generating evidence-based recommendations for diagnostic evaluation and management of gastrointestinal problems in this patient population. The panel concluded that evidence-based recommendations are not yet available. The consensus expert opinion of the panel was that individuals with ASDs deserve the same thoroughness and standard of care in the diagnostic workup and treatment of gastrointestinal concerns as should occur for patients without ASDs. Care providers should be aware that problem behavior in patients with ASDs may be the primary or sole symptom of the underlying medical condition, including some gastrointestinal disorders. For these patients, integration of behavioral and medical care may be most beneficial. Priorities for future research are identified to advance our understanding and management of gastrointestinal disorders in persons with ASDs.

### Autism spectrum disorder: diagnosis and management [^b452f6aa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders are of high prevalence and have a potentially complex range of presentations within the core impaired domains of social communication, reciprocal social interaction, imaginary thought and restricted and repetitive behaviours. Paediatricians need to recognise the possibility of these conditions among the high-risk populations of children with whom they work. This includes those presenting in the preschool years to child development clinics with delayed acquisition of language or general development delay or those presenting in the school years with coordination, academic, peer interaction and behavioural difficulties. In addition, paediatricians are essential members of the multidisciplinary teams charged with specialist assessment and their clinical history and examination can direct investigations for aetiology. This is a fast moving field with a challenging range of "grey evidence" causes and interventions. The approaches to managing these areas of work are discussed with an emphasis on recognition, important features in the history and clinical examination to aid differential diagnosis and investigations, interpreting the "grey evidence" and understanding intervention and prognosis.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^7ee710f8]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — burden, prevalence, and classification updates are highlighted, noting that ASD "affects more than 5 million Americans, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1.7% in children", and that with a "current reported prevalence rate of 1: 59 children (approximately 1.7%)", primary care clinicians "can expect to have children and youth with ASD in their practices". The economic impact is substantial, with "Direct and indirect costs of caring for children and adults with ASD in the United States in 2015 were estimated to be $268 billion", and "The lifetime cost of education, health, and other service needs for an individual with ASD ranges from $1.4 to $2.4 million dollars, depending on whether he or she has any co-occurring intellectual disabilities". Diagnostic criteria have evolved, as "The DSM-5 established a single category of ASD to replace the subtypes of autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)".

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^3034fc2d]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by patterns of delay and deviance in the development of social, communicative, and cognitive skills that arise in the first years of life. Although frequently associated with intellectual disability, this condition is distinctive in its course, impact, and treatment. Autism spectrum disorder has a wide range of syndrome expression and its management presents particular challenges for clinicians. Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder can present for clinical care at any point in development. The multiple developmental and behavioral problems associated with this condition necessitate multidisciplinary care, coordination of services, and advocacy for individuals and their families. Early, sustained intervention and the use of multiple treatment modalities are indicated.

### Technical report: the pediatrician's role in the diagnosis and management of autistic spectrum disorder in children [^41e13536]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Autism and its milder variants are not rare. Most pediatricians will have the opportunity to provide a medical home for a child with autism. This technical report serves to complement and expand on the information in the accompanying policy statement to increase the pediatrician's fund of knowledge and comfort level in caring for children with autism. In so doing, it is anticipated that earlier diagnosis and referral for appropriate intervention will be possible and that this will, in turn, have a positive effect on long-term outcomes for children with autism and their families.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^75fe4482]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic evaluation — primary care and referral is indicated once a child is determined to be at risk for a diagnosis of ASD, with timely referral for clinical diagnostic evaluation and early intervention or school services, and children with developmental delay with or without an ASD diagnosis should be referred to early intervention or school services in which cognitive and language testing may be completed. The primary care provider should discuss with the family the importance of both the assessment of developmental status and evaluation for an ASD diagnosis and assist the family in navigating through the process. Although most children will need to see a specialist, general pediatricians and child psychologists comfortable with application of the DSM-5 criteria can make an initial clinical diagnosis. At this time, there are no laboratory tests that can be used to make a diagnosis of ASD, so careful review of the child's behavioral history and direct observation of symptoms are necessary; to meet diagnostic criteria, the symptoms must impair function, and formal assessment of language, cognitive, and adaptive abilities and sensory status is an important component of the diagnostic process. Short clinical visits may not allow even a skilled clinician the opportunity to accurately recognize symptoms of ASD, and the history of symptoms of ASD can be supported by questionnaires such as the SCQ or Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), but none of these questionnaires is sufficient alone to make a diagnosis of ASD.

Key points
- Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain.
- Some people with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet known.
- Scientists believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together to change the most common ways people develop. We still have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people with ASD.
- Early intervention services can greatly improve the development of a child with ASD. Overview People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. There is often nothing about how they look that sets them apart from other people. The abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly. For example, some people with ASD may have advanced conversation skills whereas others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others can work and live with little to no support.

As children with ASD become adolescents and young adults, they may have difficulties developing and maintaining friendships, communicating with peers and adults, or understanding what behaviors are expected in school or on the job. They may come to the attention of healthcare providers because they also have conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which occur more often in people with ASD than in people without ASD. Signs and symptoms People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. These characteristics can make life very challenging. It is important to note that some people without ASD might also have some of these symptoms. Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. "Learn the Signs. Act Early.

" As a parent, you already have what it takes to help your young child learn and grow. CDC has developed materials to help you track your child's developmental milestones and share that progress, or any concerns, with your child's doctor at every check-up. CDC's "Learn the Signs. Act Early. " program aims to improve early identification of developmental delays and disabilities, such as ASD, by promoting early childhood developmental monitoring by families, child care providers, healthcare providers, and others. Risk factors There is not just one cause of ASD. Many different factors have been identified that may make a child more likely to have ASD, including environmental, biologic, and genetic factors. Although we know little about specific causes, the available evidence suggests that the following may put children at greater risk for developing ASD: CDC is currently working on one of the largest US studies to date on ASD.

This study, called Study to Explore Early Development was designed to look at the risk factors and behaviors related to ASD among young children in the US. CDC is now conducting a follow-up study of older children who were previously enrolled in SEED to determine the health, functioning, and needs of people with ASD and other developmental disabilities as they mature. Screening and diagnosis Diagnosing ASD can be difficult since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorder. Doctors look at the child's behavior and development to make a diagnosis. ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months of age or younger. By age 2 years, a diagnosis by an experienced professional can be considered reliable. However, many children do not receive a final diagnosis until they are much older. Some people are not diagnosed until they are adolescents or adults. This delay means that people with ASD might not get the early help they need.

### AWARE: management of ADHD in autism spectrum disorder… [^f59b7b43]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

AWARE: Management of ADHD in Autism Spectrum DisorderClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Current data shows that 1 in 54 children in the United States are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Additional data shows that those diagnosed with autism are also at risk for being diagnosed with a co-occurring condition such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Managing the symptoms of each can be challenging for providers, patients, and parents. Patients with ASD who are diagnosed with ADHD often face the challenge of finding the best medication options to treat symptoms. It is known that children with ASD and ADHD frequently respond differently to these treatments than typically developing children. Currently, no clear recommendations exist for parents or providers to follow to guide best medication options for patients with ASD and ADHD.

This lack of medication knowledge and suboptimal medication management can lead to poor results and have substantial negative life impact for patients and their families. The main goal of this study is to determine if the most prescribed medications for ADHD in TD children are similarly effective for patients who also have a diagnosis of autism. The results of this study will improve provider understanding of first-line stimulant medicines, methylphenidate and amphetamine compound, with ASD patients. Parents will determine medication effectiveness through discussion with their child and with their doctor as well as their own observations and will drive the medication adjustment process. Parents will provide ratings of effectiveness using the Clinical Global Impression measure every two weeks and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Vanderbilt Parent Rating Scale will be completed monthly.

For those patients who do not respond to first-line medicines, this study will further develop the understanding of second-line medication options, the alpha2 agonists guanfacine and clonidine. Parents will provide ratings using the same measures as before. Additional study measures will collect and review parent/caregiver input in the process of determining medication continuation. Most measures will be completed through electronic portals, reducing the need for families to come to the hospital to participate in this study. While these medications are routinely prescribed to treat ADHD in children and adolescents with ASD, their relative effectiveness is not known. Randomizing participants to these different medicines in this format, called a SMART design, will provide data on how well these medications work in children with ASD and ADHD, how they work compared to each other, and how their side effects differ from use in TD children.

This study will also examine the effect of these medicines on target problems identified by parents, such as oppositional behavior. Parents/caregivers will be a significant part of the data and input captured to determine if medication should continue or be discontinued. The care team of patient, parent, and provider is solid in this project and will lead to optimal decision pathways for future patients with autism. The aims outlined in this study are beneficial to patients with autism and their families/caregivers who often help navigate health care with them for life. Having access to evidence-based best practices when making medication decisions can impact and expedite positive outcomes in managing the symptoms of ADHD. When symptoms are managed at optimal levels, patients can focus on building life skills and accessing opportunities toward meaningful life outcomes.

### Expediting clinician assessment in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder [^f635b1fb]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is estimated to affect 1 in 59 children in the general population. 1 ASD diagnosis is exclusively clinical, although frequent discoveries are being made in elucidating its complex genetic and neurological basis. 2 Key components of diagnosing ASD include a positive developmental history, current symptoms, symptoms that cannot be better explained using an alternative diagnosis, and observational confirmation using DSM‐5 criteria. 3 Patients are typically referred to specialized providers who use standard clinical measures to diagnose and differentiate ASD from other disorders. Traditional measures, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS‐2) or Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised, employed by most autism specialists are time‐consuming, require extensive training, and are performed by specialized providers. 4, 5 Additionally, some studies have suggested that both the ADOS‐2 and Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised should be performed together because they better reflect a best estimate diagnosis of ASD. 6 This can result in substantial delay between the time when a child is first suspected of having ASD, is referred to a particular provider, completes the diagnostic process, and finally receives management/therapy services. Parents have reported visiting, on average, four to five clinicians en route to an ASD diagnosis and a significant number have reported dissatisfaction and distress with the process. 7, 8, 9 Such delays contribute to the fact that, across the USA, the average diagnosis is in the fourth year of life, even though symptoms are present in most affected children before the age of 2 years. Minimizing the time between initial suspicion of ASD and treatment is critical to maximizing the impact of interventions for this disorder. 10

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^997f7a2d]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research agenda — The committee's 2009 strategic plan, updated in 2017, identified 7 areas for research funding: (1) early detection, (2) underlying biology, (3) genetic and environmental risk factors, (4) treatments and interventions, (5) services and implementation science, (6) lifespan services and supports, and (7) epidemiological surveillance and infrastructure, and research in all of these areas is critical to move forward with early diagnosis, effective treatment, and evidence-based interventions at each age. The committee recommended that multiple levels of inquiry be pursued simultaneously to inform evidence-based clinical care, including basic and translational science in the areas of genetics and epigenetics, neurobiology, and psychopharmacology to develop ASD-specific behavioral and pharmacologic therapies and to identify and understand ASD risk factors; research into the underlying neurobiology of sensory symptoms and restricted interests and repetitive behaviors to inform development of targeted interventions; clinical trials to test focused interventions based on the underlying biological processes involved with ASD to determine if they are appropriate for community application; epidemiological surveillance to gather data important for planning for current and future needs, including screening, diagnosis, and lifespan health and mental health services; and health services research to provide guidance for comprehensive, accessible, and culturally appropriate medical, educational, and behavioral care for children, youth, adults, and families affected by ASD.

### Clinical assessment and management of toddlers with suspected autism spectrum disorder: insights from studies of high-risk infants [^c9439e60]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

With increased public awareness of the early signs and recent American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations that all 18- and 24-month-olds be screened for autism spectrum disorders, there is an increasing need for diagnostic assessment of very young children. However, unique challenges exist in applying current diagnostic guidelines for autism spectrum disorders to children under the age of 2 years. In this article, we address challenges related to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in this age group. We provide a comprehensive review of findings from recent studies on the early development of children with autism spectrum disorders, summarizing current knowledge on early signs of autism spectrum disorders, the screening properties of early detection tools, and current best practice for diagnostic assessment of autism spectrum disorders before 2 years of age. We also outline principles of effective intervention for children under the age of 2 with suspected/confirmed autism spectrum disorders. It is hoped that ongoing studies will provide an even stronger foundation for evidence-based diagnostic and intervention approaches for this critically important age group.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and evaluation: GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux, and feeding problems, are more commonly reported in children and adolescents with ASD than in those with developmental delay or typical development, and early-life differences have been observed as early as 6 to 18 months of age in children later diagnosed with ASD. Because of language delays and atypical sensory perception, affected individuals may present with agitation, sleep disruption, or other behavioral symptoms rather than specific GI discomfort. At present, there is no evidence of an association of ASD with celiac disease, specific immune dysfunction, or motility disorders in children with ASD, but such disorders should be considered when there is a history of GI symptoms or a change in behavior. Selective eating is common, and GI disorders should be considered when patients present with typical GI symptoms or with agitation, food refusal, or sleep disturbance; the indicated GI workup will depend on specific symptoms. Children with ASD should be offered the same approaches to treatment of GI disorders as other children, with potential modifications such as consistent behaviorally informed approaches for constipation and encopresis.

Recognition of mild ASD can be harder "in children younger than 3 years of age", and "approximately 9% of children who are diagnosed with ASD in early childhood may not meet diagnostic criteria for ASD by young adulthood". Those who no longer meet ASD criteria are more likely to have "higher cognitive skills at 2 years of age", earlier intervention participation, and decreased repetitive behaviors; diagnostic change is "more likely in children who were diagnosed with ASD before 30 months of age or had a diagnosis of PDD-NOS per the DSM-IV", and "severity scores are most likely to improve in youth who have had the greatest increase in tested verbal IQ".

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening and diagnosis — The AAP recommends screening all children for symptoms of ASD through developmental surveillance at all visits and standardized autism-specific screening tests at 18 and 24 months of age, and this complements general developmental screening at 9, 18, and 30 months of age. Developmental surveillance alone is not sufficient to identify children who need further evaluation; use of a standardized screening tool for ASD can help families identify potential symptoms. In a large study of universal screening with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), sensitivity of physician clinical concern was low (0.244; 30 of 123 cases; 95% confidence interval 0.17–0.32), whereas the sensitivity of the M-CHAT when used as directed in this low-risk population was 0.91. Results of a screening test are not diagnostic; they help the primary care provider identify children who are at risk for a diagnosis of ASD and require additional evaluation.

Core symptoms cluster in 2 domains (social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior), as described in the DSM-5. The page also notes resources for early recognition: the CDC "Learn the Signs. Act Early" Web site provides free resources to help families recognize developmental concerns, and Autism Navigator has a video glossary of early symptoms in toddlers.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^7e88a10d]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pediatric recommendations — To provide appropriate care to all children and families affected by ASD, health, education, and public health systems need to collaborate and build integrated and adequately funded and staffed systems; pediatric providers should use screening and surveillance to provide accurate and early identification, cost-effective and timely diagnosis, prompt implementation of evidence-based interventions, and elimination of disparities to access to care for children with ASD, and clinicians should respond appropriately to family or clinical concerns and results of screening to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. Children with ASD should be provided evidence-based services to address social, academic, and behavioral needs at home and school; access to appropriate pediatric and mental health care; respite services; and leisure activities. For adolescence and transition to adult systems of care, communities should build services to promote social skills appropriate for work and postsecondary education, access to appropriate medical and behavioral health services, job skills development, and community leisure opportunities; pediatricians need to engage with families and youth to plan a transition to adult medical and behavioral health care, and the medical home provider should support the family and youth in advocating for appropriate postsecondary work or schooling, residential supports, and activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The pediatrician can educate youth with ASD and their families about the evidence for interventions, refer families for possible participation in clinical research when appropriate, refer families to support organizations, and prepare families to navigate transitions. To best serve patients and families, clinicians caring for children and youth with ASD should be familiar with issues related to diagnosis, coexisting medical and behavioral conditions, and the impact of ASD on the family to provide a medical home for these patients, and actively addressing capacity building requires initiatives directed at provider education and practice quality improvement and public health, educational, and social programs to support families in their journey from diagnosis to service provision to transition to adult care.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^88c5f02c]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — disruptive behaviors and management states that disruptive behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, may complicate home and community management, and behavioral outbursts may occur in response to stressful events in the environment, in reaction to a medical condition, as functional communication, or as a symptom supporting diagnosis of a cooccurring mental health disorder. Functional behavioral analysis and implementation of behavioral strategies can be an important initial step in management, new onset of severe behaviors requires consideration of potential medical reasons, and pharmacologic treatment should be considered if no medical etiology is identified and if the behavior is associated with irritability, is not responsive to available behavioral interventions, or is related to a cooccurring diagnosable behavioral health disorder.

### Autism spectrum disorder: the new asthma? [^8ce26a7a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

While autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has traditionally been diagnosed in specialty care, rising prevalence rates have strained specialist capacity and created significant diagnostic bottlenecks. With long wait times for specialist evaluations, pediatricians are increasingly being asked to play a greater role in identifying, diagnosing, and managing ASD within the medical home. In this commentary we draw parallels between the challenges pediatricians faced two decades ago learning how to manage pediatric asthma in the medical home, to those faced today in the field of primary care ASD management. Reflecting on the lessons learnt in primary care asthma management may help us construct a roadmap towards a higher and more consistent standard of ASD primary care for patients and their families.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^ad70d668]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Assessment — Recommendation 2: If the screening indicates significant ASD symptomatology, a thorough diagnostic evaluation should be performed to determine the presence of ASD [CS]. Biological diagnostic markers are not available and diagnosis rests on careful examination of the child, so a standard psychiatric assessment should be followed, including interviews with the child and family and a review of past records and historical information, with the history and examination conducted with careful consideration of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The document notes that the diagnosis of autism in infants and very young children is more challenging and that some features may develop later, emphasizes systematic attention to areas relevant to differential diagnosis, and directs that the history include past and current educational and behavioral interventions, family history, relevant psychosocial issues, and consideration of possible comorbid diagnoses.

Section 1: Prevalence — definitions, trends, and surveillance emphasizes that "Incidence is the onset of new diagnoses over time in a selected cohort" and "Without consistent longitudinal data in a specified cohort, incidence cannot be determined", so "prevalence is more typically reported than incidence, reflecting rates of ASD in the population at a point in time". The observed increase in reported prevalence "may be attributed to several factors, including broadening in the diagnostic criteria with ongoing revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)… increased public awareness of the disorder and its symptoms, recommendations for universal screening for ASD… and increased availability of early intervention and school-based services for children with ASD", with partial contribution from "diagnostic substitution", while "A true increase in the prevalence of ASD… is also possible". Geographic patterns note that "Prevalence rates in US populations are similar to those of other industrialized countries, and lower rates are reported in resource-limited countries", and recent data indicate stabilization: "Data on national samples suggest that the prevalence of ASD is stabilizing". Surveillance approaches are summarized: "Surveillance methods include regional, state, and/or national registry systems";

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^40ead0b9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — domain structure, required symptom counts, and continuity from DSM-IV are outlined: In the DSM-5, core symptoms were divided into 2 domains (social communication and social interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behaviors), and to fulfill diagnostic criteria for ASD by using the DSM-5, all 3 symptoms of social affective difference need to be present in addition to 2 of 4 symptoms related to restrictive and repetitive behaviors; the recognition of symptoms of ASD related to sensory processing led to the inclusion of sensory symptoms, such as hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment, and the DSM-5 notes that a diagnosis may be made at older ages, when the demands of the social or school environment may result in functional impairment; almost all individuals with a diagnosis of autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome by using DSM-IV criteria would be diagnosed with ASD by using DSM-5 criteria, and the CDC ADDM Network looked at its chart abstraction data on 8-year-old children; this analysis revealed that more than 80% of children diagnosed with PDD-NOS would also be diagnosed with ASD; there is a high level of agreement of surveillance data by using DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria; and the DSM-5 criteria have been shown to appropriately identify younger children and those with mild symptoms.

### Cost of assessing a child for possible autism spectrum disorder? An observational study of current practice in child development centres in the UK [^924616f5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The assessment required to explore possible diagnosis of ASD is complex, ideally demanding the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. This study suggests this typically takes 13 hours of professional time. Based on UK costings, this costs around £650–£1000 ($975–$1500) per child. As this reflects practice based in part on available resources, consideration should be given to basing costs on the NICE exemplarsrather than who is available locally. Additional resources should be included for intervention, investigation, management of comorbid conditions and ongoing support that would need multiagency approaches including education and social care.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^d82abb1b]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

AAP autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening recommendations — AAP continues to recommend screening using the most valid of current measures at 18 and 24 months of age. Universal screening is recommended because symptoms of ASD can be identified in early childhood, and a diagnosis of ASD by skilled professionals is accurate in children as young as 18 months of age, and diagnostic stability is high for children who are diagnosed with ASD at 18 to 36 months of age. Early screening does not identify many children with milder symptoms and typical cognitive ability as at risk for ASD; therefore, ongoing surveillance remains necessary, and participation in early intervention in general is greatest among children who had screening and surveillance. Further adaptations of the Communication Symbolic Behavior Scale for use in screening for language delays in addition to ASD have the potential to identify children at risk for both disorders, ages 6–24 months, and a US Preventive Services Task Force review concluded that the literature on existing screening tools did not demonstrate sufficient specificity to justify universal screening.

### Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder: reconciling the syndrome, its diverse origins, and variation in expression [^9ed5f454]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Recent discoveries about the pathogenesis and symptom structure of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are challenging traditional nosology and driving efforts to reconceptualise the diagnosis of autism, a goal made all the more pressing by new prospects for early identification, targeted intervention, and personalised-medicine approaches to specific autistic syndromes. Recognition that ASD represents the severe end of a continuous distribution of social communication abilities in the general population has stimulated attempts to standardise the measurement of autistic traits and to set appropriate clinical thresholds for diagnosis. Over the next decade, rapid advances in our understanding of symptom structure and the diversity of causes of ASD could be incorporated into the next evolution in the diagnosis of autism, with important implications for research, clinical practice, public health, and policy. As differential effects of personalised therapies are identified in relation to specific causes of autism, the benefits of an updated diagnostic nosology will translate into the delivery of more effective care for patients.

### Pharmacologic treatment of autism [^5e617e09]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Autism is a chronic and lifelong pervasive developmental disorder for which there is yet no effective cure, and medical management remains a major challenge for clinicians. In spite of the possible similarities with conditions that have an established pharmacotherapy, and despite improvements in some associated "problematic behaviors" following the use of available medications, effective medical treatment for the core symptoms involving language and social cognition remains elusive. The purpose of the present article is to review current biologic knowledge about autism in an attempt to correlate clinical trials with known mechanisms of disease. In addition, the need for controlled studies and for the creation of homogeneous subgroups of patients based on clinical and genetic characteristics is emphasized. The application of molecular genetic investigations and pharmacogenetics in the diagnostic work-up of autistic patients can lead to more effective individualized medical care.

Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can benefit from adaptation of general pediatric guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of abdominal pain, chronic constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. These guidelines help health care providers determine when gastrointestinal symptoms are self-limited and when evaluation beyond a thorough medical history and physical examination should be considered. Children with ASDs who have gastrointestinal disorders may present with behavioral manifestations. Diagnostic and treatment recommendations for the general pediatric population are useful to consider until the development of evidence-based guidelines specifically for patients with ASDs.

### An overview of autism spectrum disorder, heterogeneity and treatment options [^624255e3]. Neuroscience Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder" for autism spectrum disorder.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder is a clinical tool designed to identify and diagnose individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The primary components of the DSM-5 criteria include persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across various contexts, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior or interests, onset of symptoms in early development, and clinically significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The criteria also necessitate the exclusion of other diagnoses that could better explain the symptoms, such as intellectual disability or global developmental delay.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder is used to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. This is achieved by assessing whether the individual exhibits all the specified characteristics and conditions. If all conditions are met, a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made. If not, the diagnostic criteria are not met. This tool is crucial in ensuring accurate diagnosis and subsequent management of autism spectrum disorder.

This tool evaluates whether the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are met. It guides users through selecting statements that correspond to five specific criteria essential for an ASD diagnosis per DSM-5 guidelines. Based on these selections, it provides a determination of whether the criteria are truly met.

The criteria for assessing ASD are:

- Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across various contexts. These deficits may involve challenges with social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing personal relationships.
- Presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. This requires at least two manifestations, such as repetitive behaviors, strict adherence to routines, intense fixated interests, or unusual sensory responses.
- Symptoms must begin in the early developmental period, even if they do not become obvious until social expectations surpass capabilities.
- Symptoms lead to clinically significant impairment in critical areas of functioning, like social and occupational areas.
- Exclusion of other diagnoses that might better account for the symptoms, including intellectual disabilities or developmental delays.

The tool methodically checks each of these criteria:

- Criterion A is about verifying social-communication deficits.
- Criterion B examines the presence of repetitive behaviors or focused interests.
- Criterion C ensures the early onset of symptoms.
- Criterion D checks that the symptoms cause important functional impairments.
- Criterion E confirms that the symptoms are not more aptly explained by other conditions.

All criteria (A, B, C, D, and E) must be true for an individual to meet the ASD diagnostic standards. If all these criteria are satisfied, the outcome will state that the individual "Meets diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder". If any of these criteria are not met, it will indicate that the "Diagnostic criteria are not met". This structured approach ensures thorough assessment aligned with DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing ASD.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^af36c7ca]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — multidisciplinary assessment and core medical evaluation: Recommendation 3 states that clinicians should coordinate an appropriate multidisciplinary assessment of children with ASD [CS], and all children with ASD should have a medical assessment including physical examination, a hearing screen, a Woods lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing (G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, and chromosomal microarray). In a community sample, diagnostic yields were 2.5% for karyotype testing, 0.57% for fragile X testing, and 24% for chromosomal microarray, and chromosomal microarray has been recommended by medical geneticists as the standard of care for the initial evaluation of children with developmental disabilities and/or ASDs. These tests detect abnormalities associated with ASD such as 15q11-13 maternal duplications and duplications and deletions of chromosome 16p11.2; recent data indicate that lower IQ predicts a positive chromosomal finding, any abnormal or indeterminate result warrants referral for further genetic evaluation and counseling, and the yield of genetic testing in the presence of clinical suspicion is currently in the range of at least one third of cases.

### Management of children with autism spectrum disorders [^0a223e3d]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Pediatricians have an important role not only in early recognition and evaluation of autism spectrum disorders but also in chronic management of these disorders. The primary goals of treatment are to maximize the child's ultimate functional independence and quality of life by minimizing the core autism spectrum disorder features, facilitating development and learning, promoting socialization, reducing maladaptive behaviors, and educating and supporting families. To assist pediatricians in educating families and guiding them toward empirically supported interventions for their children, this report reviews the educational strategies and associated therapies that are the primary treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders. Optimization of health care is likely to have a positive effect on habilitative progress, functional outcome, and quality of life; therefore, important issues, such as management of associated medical problems, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention for challenging behaviors or coexisting mental health conditions, and use of complementary and alternative medical treatments, are also addressed.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^97b380c9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening — children ages 18 to 30 months using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (Questions) (M-CHAT-R/F) — states that the most commonly used questionnaire-based screening tool is the M-CHAT; it has been further validated and the scoring modified for children ages 16 to 30 months. Children who score ≥ 8 are at high risk for ASD or another developmental disorder and should be referred immediately for diagnostic assessment. For scores of 3 to 7, scripted follow-up interview questions are required for items scored as positive; children who continue to have 3 to 7 items positive after follow-up have a 47% risk of ASD diagnosis and a 95% chance of being identified with another developmental delay that would benefit from intervention. Children screened with the M-CHAT-R/F are identified with ASD at younger ages than predicted by national statistics, children who do not pass or who score as at risk should be referred for both diagnostic assessment and intervention services, and a definitive diagnosis is not necessary to institute services for documented delays.

DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) specify two domains with required symptom counts and developmental qualifiers. Domain A (social communication/interaction) must include all three of the following: "Social-emotional reciprocity", "Nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction", and "Developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships". Domain B (restricted, repetitive patterns) requires at least 2 of 4 features; the table states "must have 2 of the 4 symptoms", with examples and headings including "Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech", "Extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day", "Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus", and "Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment". Additional notes state that symptoms must be present early, cause clinically significant impairment, and are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay.

### Treatment planning for patients with autism spectrum disorders [^9affa858]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can present with extremely heterogeneous issues, and, therefore, their treatment can be very challenging. Most patients with ASDs will benefit from contact with a multitude of disciplines. In this article, treatment planning is structured in terms of the patient's life stages. Early on, assessment of developmental milestones, metabolic conditions, and hearing; making the diagnosis of ASD; and providing genetic counseling are salient. As the child grows, speech and language therapy, early intensive intervention, special education, parent training, and neurologic assessment become important. With greater age, behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, occupational therapy, and sexuality issues are often in ascendancy. As the patient approaches and proceeds through adulthood, transition training, housing options, and guardianship issues may be priorities. Advocacy is relevant throughout the life span. Professionals have an obligation to familiarize parents with interventions likely to be fruitful or unhelpful. There is growing evidence that early intensive behavior intervention, though expensive, may produce lifelong gains in functioning. A variety of experimental and/or unproven treatments are identified; mental health professionals can help families with members who have ASDs by guiding them toward effective treatments and away from therapies of unknown value but with potential risks and/or costs.

### Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders [^448a99ee]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, the reported incidence of autism spectrum disorders has continued to increase. Coincident with this, the number of referrals to clinical geneticists to identify the etiology has also dramatically increased. The reported diagnostic yield for autism spectrum disorders is commonly reported in the range of 6–15%. However, continued advances in genetic technology expand the diagnostic options available for these evaluations and presumably increase the diagnostic yield. The list of genetic and metabolic conditions that have been reported with an autism phenotype is quite extensive. In deciding on an evaluation plan, the clinical geneticist has the difficult task of balancing an ever-expanding list of available tests and possible diagnoses with the issues of cost, practicality, and expected yield. In this article, we discuss a strategy of a tiered evaluation of the etiology of autism. These recommendations use evidence-based conclusions from the current available literature and cumulative clinical experience.

### Autism spectrum disorder: primary care principles [^cc713bbe]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulty with social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., created an umbrella diagnosis that includes several previously separate conditions: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for autism spectrum disorder in children 18 to 30 months of age in whom the disorder is not suspected; however, there is a growing body of evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention based on applied behavior analysis improves cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills. Therefore, early identification of autism spectrum disorder is important, and experts recommend the use of a validated screening tool at 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Medications can be used as adjunctive treatment for maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychiatric conditions, but there is no single medical therapy that is effective for all symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Prognosis is heavily affected by the severity of diagnosis and the presence of intellectual disability. Children with optimal outcomes receive earlier, more intensive behavioral interventions and less pharmacologic treatment.

Work closely with colleagues in community paediatrics, neurodisability and sleep medicine to optimise patient care.
Remember that autism is a life-long condition and plan transition carefully.
Ensure children, young people and families can access appropriate support.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^8d666ff9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening — children younger than age 18 months — notes that earlier diagnosis of ASD may lead to earlier treatment, the M-CHAT is the most studied and widely used tool for screening toddlers for ASD, language delay can be identified with the Infant and Toddler Checklist in low-risk infants and toddlers between 12 and 18 months of age, this questionnaire might help identify infant siblings at increased risk, and additional research may allow screening of toddlers as young as 12 months with parent-administered questionnaires such as the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile and the Infant and Toddler Checklist; primary care providers are tasked with identifying all children who would benefit from early intervention, and it is important to identify clinically significant delays with referral for appropriate diagnostic evaluation and intervention.

Autism spectrum disorder intervention access, family role, and evidence base — Interventions may be provided through public and/or not-for-profit agencies, schools, and early intervention services, and some may be paid for through insurance, and families should be involved in the selection of intervention approaches and remain an involved participant in subsequent educational and therapeutic decisions. There is regional variation in the availability of therapy types and providers that sometimes leads to long waits, less-than-desired intensity, or inability to obtain desired interventions; by law, students with ASD should receive an appropriate educational program, although it may not include all of the components desired by the family, and some types of intervention may not be paid for by insurance. It is noted that many of the interventions in common use do not have a strong evidence base, but systematic reviews of the evidence base for treatment have been completed on early intensive intervention, medical treatments, behavioral interventions, and evidence-based practice guidelines, and pediatricians may be asked to advise families on therapy choices or write prescriptions for therapies, so understanding intervention terminology and the evidence base helps communicate medically indicated treatment recommendations across care teams and payers.

Unresolved controversies/research recommendations

Areas of autism management that require further research to assess their clinical and cost-effectiveness include:
A key worker approach
Group-based parent training interventions to manage behaviour that challenges
Sleep hygiene interventions or melatonin for sleep problems
Pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for comorbid anxiety
Teacher, parent and peer-mediated psychosocial interventions to manage the core symptoms of autism in preschool children.

Clinical bottom line

Although there is currently no cure for autism, much can be done to optimise quality of life for the children, young people and families affected.
This guideline takes a holistic approach to management using high quality evidence to ensure all those diagnosed with autism receive the best possible care.

### Primary care for children with autism [^baa8dffb]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The earliest sign of autism in children is the delayed attainment of social skill milestones, including joint attention, social orienting, and pretend play. Language impairment is a common, but less specific, sign of autism. Repetitive behaviors and restricted interests may not be noted until after social skill and communication impairments are exhibited. Physicians should perform developmental surveillance at all well-child visits, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends administering an autism-specific screening tool at the 18- and 24-month visits. A referral for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is appropriate if concerns arise from surveillance, screening, or parental observations. The goals of long-term management are to maximize functional independence and community engagement, minimize maladaptive behaviors, and provide family and caregiver support. Physicians play an important role in coordinating care through an interdisciplinary team; referring families for specialized services; and treating children's associated conditions, including sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, anxiety, and hyperactivity. Autism is a lifelong condition, but early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment can improve the prognosis, whereas associated medical conditions, psychiatric conditions, and intellectual disability can worsen the prognosis.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and bipolar illness — diagnostic features and prevalence note that the DSM-5 criteria for bipolar illness include changes in activity, energy, and mood, and it may be difficult to make a diagnosis in people with ASD with limited language. The co-occurrence of bipolar illness and ASD in individuals with typical intelligence ranges from 6% to 21%, and lifetime diagnosis of bipolar illness in adults with ASD is reported to be 9%.

Language testing in ASD — formal speech-language evaluation at diagnosis should document key domains. Inherent in the core symptoms of ASD are differences in the use of verbal and nonverbal communication for social interaction, and formal assessment of communication by a speech or language pathologist at the time of diagnosis should include the documentation of expressive and receptive language skills as well as the pragmatic or conversational use of language.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions — goals, principles, and policy — the goals of treatment are to (1) minimize core deficits and co-occurring associated impairments, (2) maximize functional independence by facilitating learning and acquisition of adaptive skills, and (3) eliminate, minimize, or prevent problem behaviors that may interfere with functional skills. Treatments should be individualized, developmentally appropriate, and intensive, with performance data relevant to treatment goals to evaluate and adjust intervention, and all interventions should be based on sound theoretical constructs, rigorous methodologies, and objective scientific evidence of effectiveness. Legal mandates in education law require the use of practices supported by scientifically based research or evidence-based practices, and early intervention services under part C of IDEA provide for assessment and intervention for children younger than 3 years with developmental delays, including ASD.

### Autism spectrum disorder in primary care [^6a4bae3a]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1 in 31 US children and 1 in 45 US adults; autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of neurologic diversity, symptoms, challenges, strengths, and abilities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision criteria for autism spectrum disorder require deficits in three areas of communication and social interaction across multiple settings, with at least two restricted or repetitive behaviors, not explained by another condition, and causing functional impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to routine developmental surveillance, whereas screening in adults is not recommended. Diagnosis should include a multidisciplinary team and a multidimensional assessment. Autistic individuals have a 20- to 30-year lower life expectancy than nonautistic people and experience higher rates of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastrointestinal concerns, feeding disorders, and mental health disorders (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder focuses on minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and preventing problem behaviors. Pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for related conditions or symptoms, such as sleep disorders, seizures, mental health conditions, behavior problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Melatonin effectively reduces sleep symptoms and improves daytime behaviors with minimal adverse effects. The SPACE (sensory, predictability, acceptance, communication, empathy) framework provides specific interventions that make health care more accessible and affirming to autistic patients.

Autism spectrum disorder clinical presentation and course — age-related features, risks, and prognostic indicators are outlined: preschool children typically present with marked lack of interest in others, restricted patterns of play, and absent social and communicative intent with delays in speech and communication; in children with autism, social and communication skills usually increase by school age but problems with change and various self-stimulatory behaviors may become more prominent; in adolescence, a small number of individuals with autism make marked developmental gains while another subgroup will behaviorally deteriorate; children and adolescents with autism have an increased risk for accidental death; predictors of ultimate outcome include the presence of communicative speech by 5 years of age and overall cognitive ability; and evidence that earlier detection and provision of services improves long-term prognosis makes early diagnosis particularly important.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — changes in DSM-5 criteria have provided flexibility to diagnose other DSM-5 disorders in addition to ASD, which can help guide treatment; approximately half of children and youth with ASD also may fulfill diagnostic criteria for ADHD, pediatricians should keep in mind that some children who are later diagnosed with ASD may have been initially identified as having ADHD, and symptoms of ADHD may further compromise social skills function in children with ASD because of inattention to social cues and impulsivity.
