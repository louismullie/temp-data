## Question

A city designed an economic development plan to foster downtown revitalization efforts. The city's agent got a commitment from a major business corporation to build a large research center in the targeted area, which would bring new jobs and increased tax revenue. The city brought eminent domain proceedings to free up some 200 acres of land in the selected area. Although the city successfully condemned most of the privately-owned properties, it failed to reach agreement with nine residential property owners. Those owners brought suit seeking an injunction to prevent the taking. They claimed that this was not a taking for "public use" as required by the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment; rather the government was taking their property to give it to a private company. The case reached the Supreme Court of the United States. What will the Supreme Court decide?

Answer Choices:
A. The taking for economic development purposes is proper because developing the city's economy constitutes a public use.
B. The taking is improper because the major benefit will go to a private company and this contradicts the public use requirement.
C. The taking would primarily increase the business corporation's profit margins, which is insufficient to support the public use requirement.
D. The taking is improper because a private industry research center is not primarily open to the public's use.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the U.S. Supreme Court would rule on whether a city's use of eminent domain to acquire land for a private corporation's research center qualifies as a "public use" under the Fifth Amendment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the constitutional standard and the relevant precedent. Then, I should verify the facts of the hypothetical against that precedent. Next, I will analyze each answer choice in light of the controlling case law. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best option, making sure I don't overstate or misapply the holding.

> Let me first confirm the legal standard. The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause permits eminent domain only for "public use", and the Supreme Court's modern interpretation in Kelo v. City of New London held that economic development benefiting the community can constitute a public use, even when the land is transferred to a private entity, so long as the plan serves a public purpose and is not a pretext to benefit a particular private party [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the key facts against Kelo. The city here is pursuing downtown revitalization, expects new jobs, and anticipates increased tax revenue; the land will be transferred to a private corporation for a research center. This aligns with Kelo, where the Court approved a comprehensive economic development plan that included a research facility, hotel, and housing, emphasizing the public benefits of job creation and increased tax base despite private ownership of the condemned parcels [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option A, which claims the taking is proper because economic development is a public use. Hold on, I should confirm whether this tracks Kelo's holding. Yes, Kelo explicitly held that promoting economic development is a legitimate public purpose, and the fact that private parties may benefit incidentally does not defeat the public use requirement when the plan is genuinely aimed at public benefits like jobs and tax revenue, so Option A is consistent with controlling precedent [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option B, which argues the taking is improper because the major benefit goes to a private company. Hmm, wait a minute, that misreads Kelo. The Court rejected the notion that incidental private benefit converts a public-purpose taking into a private taking; the critical inquiry is whether the government is pursuing a bona fide public purpose, not whether a private entity ultimately uses the property, so Option B is incorrect as a statement of law [^notfound].

> Let me consider Option C, which claims the taking is invalid because the primary effect is to increase corporate profits. I should double-check whether Kelo addressed this. The Court acknowledged that private entities may profit, but held that such profit is permissible when the overarching purpose is public benefit; thus, increased corporate profitability alone does not invalidate the taking under the public use clause, making Option C inconsistent with Kelo [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option D, which asserts the taking is improper because a private research center is not open to the public. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; Kelo did not require that the condemned property be open to the public or operated by the government. The Court focused on the public benefits flowing from the economic development plan, not on public access to the specific facility, so Option D imposes a requirement that Kelo did not establish [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there is a nuance about pretext or primary benefit that could change the outcome? I need to ensure I'm not missing that. Kelo emphasized deference to legislative judgments about public purpose and warned against turning courts into arbiters of the wisdom of development plans; it also cautioned that a taking would be unconstitutional if it were a pretext to benefit a particular private party, but the hypothetical here describes a citywide revitalization plan with expected public benefits, which fits within Kelo's permissive framework rather than the pretext scenario, so the outcome remains the same [^notfound].

> Synthesis and conclusion: The Supreme Court would uphold the taking because economic development that creates jobs and increases tax revenue constitutes a public use, even when the condemned land is transferred to a private corporation, so the correct answer is Option A [^notfound].

---

The Supreme Court will likely uphold the city's use of eminent domain for economic development, as it aligns with the **Kelo v. City of New London** precedent that economic development can constitute a "public use" under the Fifth Amendment [^notfound]. The Court will defer to the city's determination that the project serves a public purpose — creating jobs, increasing tax revenue, and revitalizing downtown — even though the land will be transferred to a private corporation. Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

---

## Legal framework: the Fifth Amendment's takings clause

The Fifth Amendment provides that private property shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation". The key question is whether the city's action qualifies as a "public use".

---

## Relevant Supreme Court precedent: Kelo v. City of New London

In **Kelo v. City of New London** (2005), the Supreme Court addressed a similar issue: whether eminent domain for economic development, with property transferred to private entities, satisfies the "public use" requirement. The Court held that economic development can constitute a "public use" when it provides clear public benefits, such as:

- Job creation
- Increased tax revenue
- Economic revitalization

The Court emphasized **deference to legislative judgments** about what constitutes a public purpose, provided the taking is not a pretext for benefiting a private party.

---

## Application of Kelo to the present case

The city's plan to condemn land for a private research center mirrors the facts of Kelo: the property will be transferred to a private entity, but the stated purpose is economic development with public benefits. Applying Kelo, the Court will likely find that the taking serves a public purpose because it aims to create jobs, increase tax revenue, and revitalize downtown.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|
| A. The taking for economic development purposes is proper because developing the city's economy constitutes a public use. | Correct. This aligns with Kelo, which held that economic development can constitute a public use. |
| B. The taking is improper because the major benefit will go to a private company and this contradicts the public use requirement. | Incorrect. Kelo allows private benefit if the overall purpose is public, as here. |
| C. The taking would primarily increase the business corporation's profit margins, which is insufficient to support the public use requirement. | Incorrect. Incidental private benefit does not negate a public purpose under Kelo. |
| D. The taking is improper because a private industry research center is not primarily open to the public's use. | Incorrect. Kelo did not require public access to the specific facility; it focused on public benefits. |

---

## Conclusion

The Supreme Court will likely uphold the city's use of eminent domain, as it is consistent with **Kelo v. City of New London** and the broad interpretation of "public use" for economic development. The correct answer is **A**.

### City planning as preventive medicine [^6f53b0b3]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The health and well-being of rapidly growing urban populations is a global health issue. Cities in the global north and south are faced with rising health inequities - or avoidable differences in health determinants and outcomes based on place, social status and ethnicity. This commentary suggests that focusing only on treatment interventions in cities is likely to fail because populations will be forced to go back into the urban living and working conditions that likely made them sick in the first place. City planning as preventive medicine includes taking a relational and systems approach to urban health, requiring health assessments for all urban policy making, promoting neighborhood health centers as engines of community economic development and gathering place-based health indicator data to track progress and adapt interventions over time as conditions change.

### The overturning of chevron deference: implications for the US healthcare system [^2d7376e9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 1984, Chevron deference was established by the US Supreme Court in Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, granting administrative agencies broad powers to interpret ambiguous laws passed by Congress. This landmark decision has fostered decades of controversy among legal scholars. Opponents argued it deprived courts of their constitutional duty and inappropriately expanded the power of the administrative state, while proponents claimed federal agencies, staffed by experts in their field, possess specialized knowledge to most effectively accomplish the goals of Congress. In June 2024, the Supreme Court's ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo effectively ended Chevron deference, altering the judicial landscape with significant implications for US healthcare. In this commentary, we discuss the various potential benefits and challenges that the US healthcare system will face in a post-Chevron landscape while also considering the ways in which clinicians will be expected to help address these obstacles.

### Pandemic influenza as 21st century urban public health crisis [^1baa6ee6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cities are the norm of global development in the 21st century. As cities become larger and more crowded, traditional guidance for detecting and responding to public health crises requires innovation. Modified guidance may be helpful, but new strategies, technologies, and metrics also will be needed.

Preliminary accounts of response to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 during spring 2009 in 2 world megacities offer grounds for optimism. In each case, advance planning laid the foundation for enhanced surveillance and a generally effective response, made possible by an extensive public communications campaign and effective political leadership. On the other hand, challenges emerged that would have been amplified if the illness had been more severe or the period of societal disruption prolonged. Development of new guidance and approaches requires collaboration among large cities, as well as research and evaluation to identify best practices for cities with different resource levels, particularly for implementing core capacity requirements under the revised IHR in a world where most persons now live in urban environments. The IHR require all countries to have core capacity for disease "surveillance, reporting, notification, verification, response and collaboration activities" by 2012. These requirements must be implemented in urban environments, but they are based on traditional public health levels (local, intermediate, and national), which are less clearly defined for large urban agglomerations. All national governments have committed themselves to IHR implementation; municipalities must play a central role but may not be aware of their obligations or able to meet them. Many partners will be important, including businesses, which may not realize their stake in IHR implementation. Sharing of experience and research is needed to develop strategies and best practices that can be considered by similar cities worldwide.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 749: marriage and family building equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and gender nonconforming individuals [^8e44eeac]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Marriage equality — ACOG states that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reaffirms its support of unrestricted access to legal marriage for all people, and notes that although the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, Obergefell v. Hodges, has and will continue to positively affect health and well-being, it should not be interpreted as affording automatic and complete equality. The positive effect marriage equality has on physical, mental, and financial health has been consistently demonstrated, including fewer depressive symptoms and lower levels of stress among same-sex couples in legally recognized relationships, significantly less psychological stress where legal recognition preceded the Supreme Court decision, and significant increases in mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders where same-sex marriage had been constitutionally banned. Coverage and benefits implications include that the Obergefell v. Hodges decision has had a variety of effects on health insurance coverage, with many employers discontinuing domestic partner benefits and legal actions arguing that Obergefell does not necessarily give same-sex couples the right to marriage-related benefits; a unanimous Texas Supreme Court decision in June 2017 determined that Obergefell does not automatically compel cities in Texas to furnish tax-funded employment benefits to same-sex couples equal to those of opposite-sex couples.

### The supreme court's decision in: does it condone healthcare injustice? [^417d39c3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

The UK Supreme Court's recent judgement in McCulloch v Forth Valley Health Board clarifies the standard for the identification of 'reasonable' alternative medical treatments. The required standard is that of a reasonable doctor: treatments that would be accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion. Accordingly, the assessment of consent involves a two-stage test: first, a 'reasonable doctor' test for identifying alternative treatments; followed by a 'reasonable person in the patient's position' test for identifying the material risks of these reasonable alternative treatments. The separation of consent into two stages is consistent with not only a certain conception of freedom but also a nuanced construct of respect for autonomy that has a normative base. Furthermore, reliance on a reasonable doctor in the first stage is in keeping with a sociological account of medical professionalism, which posits that only doctors, and none others, can determine what is a proper treatment. Yet, reliance on a reasonable doctor permits a plurality of standards for reasonableness, because differences in opinion among doctors are pervasive. The reasons for some differences might be acceptable as unavoidable imperfections in medical decision-making to a reasonable person. But reasons for other differences might be objectionable; and the resultant inequalities in medical treatments would be considered unfair. One solution is to make the plurality of reasonable alternatives available to the patient, but this would introduce practical uncertainty and it is rejected by the Court. The Court's approach may be pragmatic; however, it seems to allow avoidable injustice in healthcare.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Role and value of the corporate medical director [^9f3689cc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Emergency preparedness — The corporate medical director (CMD) role includes "emergency preparedness," and "Business continuity planning for critical events is a core activity for all corporations." Health threats "such as global pandemics or localized large outbreaks of infectious disease do have the potential to disrupt business on a global scale," so "The modeling of table-top scenarios and practice drills are part of an integrated risk analysis," and "each major work-site and the company overall should know the principal threats… and have corresponding critical event plans." The global CMD "needs to be prepared to deal with routine communicable disease outbreaks such as TB or measles," and in a pandemic influenza outbreak "can decide which published or internal emergency phase approach to use, and participate in the incident command role and system," with the caution that "critical events seldom play out exactly as predicted," requiring flexible planning and leadership actions.

### The influence of neuroscience on US supreme court decisions about adolescents' criminal culpability [^778fff17]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2013). Medium credibility.

In the past 8 years, the US Supreme Court has issued landmark opinions in three cases that involved the criminal culpability of juveniles. In the most recent case, in 2012, a ruling prohibited states from mandating life without parole for crimes committed by minors. In these cases, the Court drew on scientific studies of the adolescent brain in concluding that adolescents, by virtue of their inherent psychological and neurobiological immaturity, are not as responsible for their behaviour as adults. This article discusses the Court's rationale in these cases and the role of scientific evidence about adolescent brain development in its decisions. I conclude that the neuroscientific evidence was probably persuasive to the Court not because it revealed something new about the nature of adolescence but precisely because it aligned with common sense and behavioural science.

### The current approach of the courts [^fc117b99]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The approach of the courts when considering proprietary ('ownership') interests in human bodily material has been pragmatic and piecemeal. The general principle was initially that such material is not legally 'property' that can be 'owned', but courts have recognised many exceptions. In determining disputes between individuals in particular cases, they have stated principles that are often inconsistent with those stated in other cases with different facts. Later judges have been constrained by these decisions, especially when made at appellate level. They can distinguish the facts of one case from another to achieve a different outcome, but they cannot state new principles to be applied more widely to promote consistency. This requires the will of Parliament and legislation to introduce new principles. Experience to date suggests that such legislation will need to be wide-ranging and complex, with different principles for different circumstances. There will not be one area of law that answers all the issues that arise.

### The US supreme court joins the debate over gender dysphoria [^2341f408]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

US v. Skrmetti is a legal case currently pending before the US Supreme Court that addresses the constitutionality of a Tennessee statute that prohibits gender-affirming medical care for transgender individuals who have not yet reached the legal age of adulthood, and who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Twenty-five other states have similar bans that apply to adolescents diagnosed with gender dysphoria, who are seeking treatment recommended by a physician and who are supported by their parents. Treatment involves gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, such as leuprolide or histrelin, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children with central precocious puberty and are commonly prescribed off-label for adolescents. The purpose of puberty-blocking drugs is to suppress the onset of hormonal changes of puberty to facilitate the youth's anticipated transgender transition when the youth does reach the legal age of adulthood. Certainty about the time available for a youth to consider their gender identity, with the guidance of a professional support team, minimizes the risk of disruptive anxiety that's associated with near-term onset of sexual maturation involving development of irreversible secondary sex characteristics. This Commentary presents the legal arguments in the case and discusses relevant medical literature on this important issue in anticipation of the US Supreme Court's decision on the Tennessee law.

### Framework legislation for non-communicable diseases: and for the sustainable development goals? [^0c23957c]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

This article briefly reviews some of the issues countries might consider when developing framework legislation for NCDs. In addition to NCDs, the UN General Assembly has undertaken an ambitious governance role in global health through the adoption, in 2015, of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs provide a blueprint for economic, social and environmental development for the period 2015–2030 for all countries, irrespective of income level. Health is the focus of SDG3 ('ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages') but is also a determinant of other goals and targets and/or a beneficiary of their achievement (box 1). Although they extend well beyond NCDs, the health-related SDGs create similar demands for effective national governance. A similar case might, therefore, be made for framework legislation or for legislation to govern particular aspects, such as public–private partnerships to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.

Countries vary widely in terms of their historical and legal traditions and constitutional structures. In some countries, legislative powers are devolved to provincial or regional governments. Provincial, as well as local and city administrations, may consider legislation to support the implementation of strategies for reducing health risks and to contribute to the achievement of national health goals. In many countries, governments will already have the legislative or executive authority they need to take decisive action to protect the health of the population. The absence of framework legislation is not, therefore, an excuse for inaction in addressing substantive challenges such as tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy foods and drinks. Where legislatures do enact framework legislation, its ultimate value will depend on it being a catalyst, rather than a substitute for action.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^500f6832]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Media and public health law — federal and state powers for communicable disease control state that U.S. federal law permits the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take measures to prevent spread of diseases when state or U.S. possession actions are insufficient, and measures may include inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection. A person who has a communicable disease during the transmissible period can be restricted from traveling from one state or possession to another without a permit from the state or territorial health officer, or destination locality. For interstate conveyances on which a case or suspected case develops, the person in charge is required, as soon as practicable, to notify the local health authority at the next port of call, station, or stop, and to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease as the local health authority directs. State laws authorize quarantine and isolation powers, often granted in the state public health code, and courts have consistently upheld these powers as consistent with state police powers; scope varies, with some states having broad powers applicable to any emerging infectious disease threat and others targeting specific conditions. Constitutional limitations apply, requiring compliance with procedural and substantive due process and that when deprivation of liberty involves a fundamental right the government must demonstrate a compelling interest and that the power is narrowly tailored to achieve a public health goal. Other community containment uses of state police powers, such as social distancing, event cancellation, and related strategies, also may raise constitutional concerns but are less restrictive on liberties and therefore less likely to face strict scrutiny by a court.

### The expert witness: understanding the rationale [^b65260f3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The origins of the use of expert witnesses to assist courts in helping understand the required conduct in determining the standard of care provides a basis for recognizing the consultant role sought in judicial proceedings. Both rules of evidence and court decisions have evolved in a manner that encourages the introduction of expert testimony while conditioning its use to avoid unfair bias. Trial court judges decide on permitting such testimony, while legal counsel is responsible for helping juries determine its importance and reliability. Certain types of restrictions and adverse consequences for misstatements exist but are subordinated to the trial process in most circumstances, a process that varies among different jurisdictions.

### Post-dobbs legal conundrums surrounding preimplantation in vitro fertilization embryo dispositions [^d5de0b1e]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

The legal issues surrounding in vitro fertilization from its beginnings have found their way into courtrooms and legislatures, with disposition of cryopreserved in vitro fertilization preimplantation embryos presenting legal and policy conundrum for patients, providers, and lawmakers in a myriad of contexts. This article examines the legal aspects of selected embryo disposition issues and the potential impact of laws enacted following the US Supreme Court's recent removal of Constitutional protections for reproductive choice and autonomy in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

### Advocacy and collaborative health care for justice-involved youth [^3a55d8c1]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Life without parole and death penalty for juveniles — Over the last 15 years, the US Supreme Court issued decisions declaring unconstitutional capital punishment for crimes committed as a juvenile (under age 18) and abolishing mandatory life without parole sentences, but it is still permissible to impose life without parole after judicial consideration of individualized circumstances; the United States is the only country that sentences juveniles to life without the possibility of parole and advocacy efforts are underway to abolish such sentences.

### Housing assistance and supportive services in Memphis | ASPE… [^975b8753]. aspe.hhs.gov (2013). Low credibility.

The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services entered into a contract with the Urban Institute and its subcontractor the University of Memphis to foster effective delivery of services to current and former recipients of housing assistance in Memphis. This work was intended to inform Memphis' Strong Cities, Strong Communities planning effort and includes: 1) an assessment of current conditions, challenges, and opportunities; and 2) dialogue with and technical assistance to local stakeholders who coordinate, fund, and provide services to high-needs Memphis residents who receive housing assistance funded by the U. S. In 2011, the City of Memphis was selected for the White House Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative. SC2 provides federal technical assistance to help cities access or leverage existing federal and local resources for community revitalization and to form new organizational connections on a federal and local level.

One key goal of the SC2 initiative is to help to break down existing silos between local governments and federal departments. This project is intended to support that effort by providing information about programs for residents of assisted housing, particularly those who have been affected by Memphis' HOPE VI revitalization efforts. BACKGROUND AND MEMPHIS SERVICE CONTEXT Over the past two decades, policymakers have sought to transform public and assisted housing from a symbol of the failures of social welfare policy into a catalyst for revitalizing neighborhoods and helping residents improve their life chances. Public housing residents face numerous barriers to self-sufficiency: low educational attainment, poor mental and physical health, limited access to social networks that facilitate job access, and physical isolation from opportunity.

Different federal initiatives have attempted to help residents overcome these barriers — by relocating residents to higher-opportunity areas, offering alternative rent structures, and replacing distressed developments with new mixed income housing. Evidence from evaluations of the largest federal initiatives suggests that increasing public housing residents' geographic access to opportunity improved their quality of life — but was not enough to help them overcome their multiple personal and structural barriers to self-sufficiency. The $6 billion HOPE VI program, which funded the demolition and revitalization of hundreds of distressed public housing communities across the nation, had as a core goal of improving residents' quality of life and helping them move toward self-sufficiency.

However, the program included only modest funding for community supportive services. Generally, these services have focused on workforce efforts and been limited in size and scope. The Memphis Housing Authority has received five HOPE VI grants since 1995, the most recent in 2010.

### Projected health outcomes associated with 3 US supreme court decisions in 2022 on COVID-19 workplace protections, handgun-carry restrictions, and abortion rights [^962110f0]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The US Supreme Court has issued myriad rulings with ramifications for public health and medical care, but few have drawn such widespread criticism, including from the medical community, or carried such large potential consequences for the health of US citizens health as 3 landmark cases that it decided in 2022. The first ruling, issued in January 2022 in National Federation of Independent Business v Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), overturned the OSHA emergency temporary standard (ETS) that would have required large employers to implement measures to protect their workers from COVID-19. Subsequently, over the course of 8 days in June 2022, the court issued several decisions with major public health consequences. In New York State Rifle and Pistol Association Inc v Bruen, Superintendent of New York State Police (Bruen), the court decision voided laws in 6 states and the District of Columbia restricting the right to carry handguns, a decision likely to increase handgun carrying and possibly undermine other gun regulations. In Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (Dobbs), the court overturned Roe v Wade, which had protected abortion rights since 1973; abortion bans went into effect immediately in several states and more are forthcoming.

Many commentators have criticized these decisions as a threat to public health. However, none have comprehensively modeled their quantitative impact. We projected the outcomes of these decisions on mortality and other adverse health consequences.

### Do recent US supreme court rulings on patenting of genes and genetic diagnostics affect the practice of genetic screening and diagnosis in prenatal and reproductive care? [^2c9814b5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Thousands of patents have been awarded that claim human gene sequences and their uses, and some have been challenged in court. In a recent high-profile case, Association for Molecular Pathology, et al. v. Myriad Genetics, Inc, et al., the US Supreme Court ruled that genes are natural occurring substances and therefore not patentable through 'composition of matter' claims. The consequences of this ruling will extend well beyond ending Myriad's monopoly over BRCA testing and may affect similar monopolies of other commercial laboratories for tests involving other genes. It could also simplify intellectual property issues surrounding genome-wide clinical sequencing, which can generate results for genes covered by intellectual property. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for common aneuploidies using cell-free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal blood is currently offered through commercial laboratories and is also the subject of ongoing patent litigation. The recent Supreme Court decision in the Myriad case has already been invoked by a lower district court in NIPT litigation and resulted in invalidation of primary claims in a patent on currently marketed cffDNA-based testing for chromosomal aneuploidies.

### Revisiting the 1990 special issue on minority children: an editorial perspective 15 years later [^1b1df068]. Child Development (2006). Low credibility.

The 2006 Special Issue on Race, Ethnicity, and Culture in Child Development occurs 15 years after the 1990 Special Issue on Minority Children and marks roughly 50 years since the historic 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. This issue provides an assessment of how researchers have represented development of America's diverse youth. This commentary provides a perspective of the progress and needs inferred from the 1990 special issue. A consistent theme is the necessity to link research and developmental theorizing with the intentions of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, as the relevant integration is often left to legal scholars, Whiteness studies theorists, and a few child-development-focused researchers (e.g. Cross, 1991; Spencer, 2005).

### Not so new directions in the law of consent? Examining montgomery V lanarkshire health board [^d4cc0f7b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

This paper examines the UK Supreme Court decision in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board, which deals with consent and information disclosure in medical treatment and care. It signaled a move away from a 'doctor knows best' approach to one that focuses on disclosing information to which particular patients would attach significance. Notwithstanding concerns about increased litigation and loss of professional autonomy, the reality is that the decision will make little difference to healthcare practice and consent in the UK. The Supreme Court has endorsed a view that most lawyers and doctors thought already prevailed, and it reflects the General Medical Council's guidance on the issue of consent in any case. Given recent healthcare scandals in the National Health Service (NHS), the Supreme Court's legal recognition of the importance of recognizing patient autonomy in disclosing risks about medical treatment and care is a welcome development.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^4cb232f7]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Restrictions on property — public health emergency powers may permit a range of action by state and local governments to restrict, secure, and manage property during an emergency response, with examples including decontamination of facilities, acquisition of vaccines, medicines, or hospital beds, and use of private facilities for isolation, quarantine, or disposal of human remains. Once a public health emergency has been declared, some states allow authorities to use and take temporary control of certain private sector businesses and activities that are of critical importance to epidemic control measures; authorities may take control of landfills and other disposal facilities and services to safely eliminate infectious waste, health-care facilities and supplies may be procured or controlled to treat and care for patients and the general public, and areas normally accessible to the public may be closed to prevent additional exposures. Whenever health authorities take private property to use for public health purposes, constitutional law requires that the property owner be provided just compensation, meaning the state must pay private owners for the use of their property. Under existing legal powers to abate public nuisances, authorities are able to condemn, remove, or destroy any property that may harm the public's health, and permissible property control measures may include restricting certain commercial transactions and practices, such as price gouging. Because the application of law varies in different states, it is advisable to consult with an attorney to understand the applicable law in any particular jurisdiction.

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^4bc8cbde]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Child/adolescent as medical decision-maker — participation and capacity are outlined: the value of involving children and adolescents in their own medical decision-making is increasingly recognized, and children and adolescents are dependent on their parents for most aspects of their daily life and usually have limited experience with making any medical decisions; in Cardwell v Bechtol, the Tennessee Supreme Court used the "rule of sevens" to uphold the presumption of decision-making capacity for a 17-year-old girl and stated that no capacity exists for children younger than the age of 7 years, a lack of capacity is presumed but may be rebutted between 7 and 14 years, and capacity is presumed but may be rebutted at 14 years and older.

### New Hampshire house bill 1719-FN. "An act defining human life as beginning at the moment of fertilization for the purposes of prenatal, pregnancy, and maternity services and programs" [^8ccde6d8]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, the author was asked by the New Hampshire State Medical Society to testify before the State of New Hampshire's House Judiciary Committee, to address a bill that would establish the definition of when human life begins. Other states, such as South Dakota, recently passed a ban on abortion. Such legislation will severely limit a woman's ability to exercise her right to terminate her pregnancy. With the present composition of the US Supreme Court, it seems possible that in the not-too-distant future there will be a successful challenge to Roe v Wade. It is important that as health care providers we take the time to educate our public officials and general citizenry about the complexity of such issues. The subsequent editorial will paraphrase the statement that was delivered. Fortunately, the bill was defeated.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Aplisol) [^73b23b93]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of Tuberculin Reaction

Readings of Mantoux reactions should be made by a trained health professional during the period from 48 to 72 hours after the injection. Induration only should be considered in interpreting the test. The diameter of induration should be measured transversely to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters. Erythema has no diagnostic value and should be disregarded. The presence and size of necrosis and edema if present should be recorded although not used in the interpretation of the test. In the absence of induration, an area of erythema greater than 10 mm in diameter may indicate the injection was made too deeply and retesting is indicated. Find the margins of the induration by drawing the index or middle finger lightly across the reaction. The tip of a ballpoint pen pushed at a 45° angle toward the site of injection will also stop at the edges of induration.

The diameter of induration should be measured (preferable with a caliper) transversely to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters.

Erythema has no diagnostic value and should be disregarded. The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative".

Reactions should be interpreted as follows (Please refer to most recent guidelines):

Based on current guidelines,3,7,14, 19interpretation of reactions is as follows:

Positive reactions:

Skin test conversions

For persons with negative skin test reactions who undergo repeat skin testing (e.g., health care workers), an increase in reaction size ≥ 10 mm within a period of 2 years should be considered a skin test conversion indicative of recent infection with M. tuberculosis .19
In some individuals who have been infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria or have undergone BCG vaccination, the skin test may show some degree of induration. For these individuals, a conversion to "positive" is defined as an increase in induration by 10 mm on subsequent tests.7

Healthcare facilities and other high-risk settings

For health care workers and employees in other high-risk settings with no other risk factors for TB, a cut-off of 15 mm of induration (rather than 10 mm) on the tuberculin skin test should be used to define a positive baseline test at the time of initial employment.
An increase of ≥ 10 mm in reaction size is generally accepted as a positive test result on subsequent testing unless the worker is a contact of a TB case or has HIV infection or is otherwise immunocompromised, in which case a result of ≥ 5 mm is considered positive.21

### The role of human rights litigation in improving access to reproductive health care and achieving reductions in maternal mortality [^0223b2cb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Supreme Court of Uganda reversed the Constitutional Court's decision and held that the Ugandan Constitution provided direct access to the Constitutional Court for constitutional interpretation and that the political question doctrine did not apply to the constitutional claims asserted in the case. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Katureebe directed the Constitutional Court's attention to two cases, Minister of Health and Others v. Treatment Action Campaign of 2002 and Paschim Banga, wherein the Constitutional Court of South Africa and the Supreme Court of India found a right to health in their state constitutions. Thus, in addition to rejecting the application of the political question doctrine and remanding the case to the constitutional court for consideration, the Chief Justice also provided the Constitutional Court with direction on how to assess the merits of the petitioners' constitutional challenge. The Supreme Court directed the Constitutional Court to consider whether the facts in the case were supported by evidence, and if so, to determine whether failure to deliver maternal health care services violated the right to access medical services under the constitution. On September 1, 2016, the case was reopened by the Constitutional Court in Uganda and is currently pending.

Even though the Constitutional Court decided against the plaintiffs, the case brought public attention and advocacy to the issue of maternal mortality in Uganda. After Petition No. 16 was filed, various CSOs working independently on maternal health issues created the Coalition to Stop Maternal Mortality. In 2012, the Coalition, other CSOs, and the public health community advocated for an increase in the budget to recruit, motivate, and retain health care workers. They successfully encouraged members of Parliament to block a new budget that failed to address the Coalition's demands. As a result, members of Parliament and the President agreed to allocate approximately $15 million dollars to address the health care workforce shortage. Petition No. 16 provided the Coalition and partnering CSOs with a focal point and support for their campaign.

### Fezolinetant (Veozah) [^591aa04f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no data on VEOZAH use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

In embryo-fetal toxicity animal studies with fezolinetant, embryo-lethality occurred at high doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats and rabbits, but no teratogenicity was observed. In the pre- and post-natal development animal study, delayed parturition and embryo-lethality occurred at high doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats. Additionally, in the male offspring delayed male reproductive maturation was observed, characterized by incomplete preputial separation, which affected male fertility at doses above the human therapeutic dose in rats [see Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In embryo-fetal development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, embryo-lethality was noted at the highest doses (128- and 174-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose for rats and rabbits, respectively). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryo-fetal development was 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 45 mg/kg/day in rabbits (62- and 16‑fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose for rats and rabbits, respectively). Fezolinetant showed no effects on fertility and early embryonic development in rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, the NOAEL for maternal and fetal toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day (36‑fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose) based on delayed parturition and embryo-lethality at 100 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for F1generation development was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day for females (204-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose) and 10 mg/kg/day for males (11-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose). The F1male showed delayed male reproductive maturation, characterized as incomplete balanopreputial separation at time of mating, at doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (36-fold the human AUC24at the human therapeutic dose), which affected male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Environmental issues in global pediatric health: policy statement [^50907d7c]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for governmental and nongovernmental agencies — Policy directions include that "Nations, states, territories, and cities must take action to end the exposure of all children to known toxic chemicals and to prevent the entry of untested new chemicals into markets" and that "Nations, states, and cities must put the protection of children's health at the center of all environmental legislation and rule making and deliberately consider potential impacts on children's health in all environmental decision making." Additional guidance is to "When setting environmental regulations, use the best available scientific evidence that adequately considers the unique vulnerabilities of children as well as the impacts on children's health and development of cumulative exposures to chemical mixtures," to "When setting environmental regulations, seek whenever possible to regulate entire classes of chemicals such as the organophosphate insecticides rather than individual chemicals within such classes," and to "Increase the resources directed to global public health and pollution prevention to better protect children against environmental threats to health" and "Increase resources for the surveillance, analysis, and reporting of environmental exposures and environmentally related diseases."

### Violent video games and the supreme court: lessons for the scientific community in the wake of Brown V. entertainment merchants association [^449b11ce]. The American Psychologist (2013). Low credibility.

In June 2011 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that video games enjoy full free speech protections and that the regulation of violent game sales to minors is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court also referred to psychological research on violent video games as "unpersuasive" and noted that such research contains many methodological flaws. Recent reviews in many scholarly journals have come to similar conclusions, although much debate continues. Given past statements by the American Psychological Association linking video game and media violence with aggression, the Supreme Court ruling, particularly its critique of the science, is likely to be shocking and disappointing to some psychologists. One possible outcome is that the psychological community may increase the conclusiveness of their statements linking violent games to harm as a form of defensive reaction. However, in this article the author argues that the psychological community would be better served by reflecting on this research and considering whether the scientific process failed by permitting and even encouraging statements about video game violence that exceeded the data or ignored conflicting data. Although it is likely that debates on this issue will continue, a move toward caution and conservatism as well as increased dialogue between scholars on opposing sides of this debate will be necessary to restore scientific credibility. The current article reviews the involvement of the psychological science community in the Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association case and suggests that it might learn from some of the errors in this case for the future.

### HRS expert consensus statement on the management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in patients nearing end of life or requesting withdrawal of therapy [^16b15585]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Medium credibility.

U.S. legal foundation for life-sustaining treatment decisions and CIED deactivation — The courts in the United States have ruled that treatment decision-making is both a common law right based on bodily integrity and self-determination and a constitutional right based on privacy and liberty, and U.S. courts have consistently upheld a patient's right to refuse ongoing treatment. The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that patients have the right to refuse life-sustaining treatments and ruled that a feeding tube is a medical treatment without unique status. Courts further ruled that adult patients have a constitutional right to refuse any treatment, including life-sustaining treatment, and that there is no legal difference between withdrawing an ongoing treatment and not starting treatment; these rights extend to patients who lack decision making capacity via previously expressed statements and surrogate decision-makers. In none of these cases did courts distinguish between types of life-sustaining treatments; although the Supreme Court has not specifically commented on PM or ICD deactivation, discontinuation of these therapies is addressed by precedents upholding the right to discontinue life-sustaining treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^61f8f7b0]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — lung function testing to document variable expiratory airflow limitation — notes that lung function is most reliably assessed by spirometry testing with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Spirometry testing should be carried out by well-trained operators with well-maintained and regularly calibrated equipment, with an inline filter to protect against transmission of infection. When spirometry is unavailable, peak expiratory flow (PEF), although less reliable, is better than no objective measurement; if PEF is used, the best of 3 measurements should be used each time, and the same meter should be used for follow-up testing, as measurements may differ from meter to meter by up to 20%. Responsiveness refers to rapid improvements in FEV1 or PEF within minutes after a rapid-acting bronchodilator such as 200–400 mcg salbutamol, or more sustained improvement over days or weeks after introduction of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. In patients with typical or suggestive respiratory symptoms, obtaining evidence of excessive variability in expiratory lung function is an essential component of diagnosis, with examples including an increase in lung function 10–15 minutes after a bronchodilator or after a trial of ICS-containing treatment; lung function may improve gradually, so it should be assessed after at least 4 weeks, a decrease in lung function after exercise or during a bronchial provocation test, and variation beyond the normal range on repeated measurements, including on twice-daily home monitoring over at least 1–2 weeks; a decrease in FEV1 or PEF during a respiratory infection does not necessarily indicate asthma.

### Courting the expert: a clash of culture? [^0a2f2041]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the utility of expert opinion in legal proceedings and the deployment of expert witnesses in adversarial litigation. The use of expert witnesses to assist courts in making just and fair conclusions may be contrasted with the partisan interests of those who call them. An adversarial system is a bad method of scientific enquiry and undermines the court's capacity to reach the 'right' answer. As a consequence, courts may reach the wrong conclusion based on bad science. The role of the expert as a witness places strain on an expert to provide certainty, where in fact there may be none. Recent reforms in the civil courts have changed little and the problem is even more acute in criminal trials. The expert can rely solely on the integrity of his or her own opinion, tempered with a little humility. However, when filtered through the rhetoric and advocacy of a court arena, even this may be compromised.

### Cities for global health [^1fcf97b9]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The number of people, and proportion of the world population, living in cities has increased steadily, with 4.2 billion urban residents now accounting for 55% of the world's population (fig 1). That urban living influences health is well recognised and increasingly included in broader discussions about cities and sustainable human development. The general tone of such discourse, however, tends towards the negative aspects of infectious outbreaks, vehicular pollution, waste disposal, and unhealthy lifestylesrather than the "positive and progressive aspects of cities. recognised by historians, economists, and other social scientists."

Fig 1
Number of people living in rural areas and in cities in the world. Data are from the World Urbanization Prospects

Empirical evidence strongly points to urban residents having better health than their rural counterparts since at least the early to mid 20th century, in high income as well as low and middle income countries. The health advantages of urban living, however, are unevenly distributed in cities, with massive inequalities existing over short distances (fig 2). Our urbanising world provides an opportunity, and an imperative, to not only further improve population health in cities but also to leverage cities as nodes in a natiotrafinal and global network to improve health in and across countries. Reducing inequalities is fundamental because population health suffers where inequalities are larger.

Fig 2
Life expectancy at birth in 2012 in London's local authorities. Data are from Bennett et al

The urban health literature commonly uses the "healthy city" concept to frame discussions. The idealised healthy city, although aspirational, can easily be disconnected from the complex dynamics of urban development, in which cities' demographics and social, natural, built, and food environments are constantly changing through interactions between individual, corporate, and public actions. Limited attention has also been given to the essential role of urban services, including healthcare, childcare, and public safety. Thus the policy challenge for improving health in cities, first laid out a century ago by Chapin, remains — to identify and implement institutional and technical innovations in every sector that form transition pathways to better health, taking into account the contemporary local social, demographic, and economic conditions. We discuss a set of themes in which municipal governments and administrators (referred to as "cities" hereafter) can foster innovation in technology and practice and achieve economies of scale in services that improve the health of their own residents and benefit a wider geography, with emphasis on their role in reducing health inequalities.

### Making cities mental health friendly for adolescents and young adults [^147d6012]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Action for adolescent mental health aligns well with actions nations should take to achieve development targets, and collective action to draw attention to these areas of synergy could benefit youth and cities. Specifically, supporting the mental health of young people aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the New Urban Agenda that aims to "ensure sustainable and inclusive urban economies, to end poverty and to ensure equal rights and opportunities… and integration into the urban space" –.

Additionally, the list of mental health-friendly city characteristics presents a starting point for strengthening the evidence base on intervening at multiple levels (for example, individual, family, community, organizations and environment) to better understand what works for which youth in which settings. Cities function as complex systems, and systems-centred research can best enable us to understand how individuals' interactions with one another and with their environments influence good or poor mental health. Similarly, interdisciplinary inquiry is needed that investigates urban precarity and sheds light on social interventions for youth mental health. New research that tests implementation strategies and measures mental health outcomes of coordinated cross-sectoral interventions in cities could be integrated with planned actions. Innovative uses of data that measure the 'racial opportunity gap' can help cities to understand how race and place interact to reduce economic well-being for minoritized young people on their trajectory to adulthood. Even heavily studied relationships, such as mental health and green space, can benefit from new methodologies for measuring exposures, including application of mixed methods, and refined characterization of outcomes by gender and age with a focus on adolescents and youth. Globally, mental health-supporting actions for young people in urban areas have an incomplete evidence base, with more peer-reviewed publications skewed towards North American research.

### Research integrity and the law that never was [^548c0b88]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is arguably among the most important innovations of the modern era, but publication bias and inadequate research transparency are serious issues affecting the very foundation of evidence-based practice. Despite this truth, these crucial issues have gone largely unaddressed or inadequately addressed for a distressingly long period of time. Regulatory efforts have thus far proven insufficient in eliminating these issues. Fortunately, the last 5 years in particular have seen developments that one hopes will contribute to the eradication of these issues and a future where we can look back on these issues as a sordid story of our past. However, much like the purported fixes of the past, time will be the final arbiter of the efficacy of remedial measures currently underway. This article chronicles the history of these issues, failed attempts to fix these issues, and what can be and is being done with the hope of bringing about true resolution.

### Addressing challenges related to the professional practice of abortion post-roe [^f39021b3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

The landmark Roe vs Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973 established a constitutional right to abortion. In June 2022, the Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court decision brought an end to the established professional practice of abortion throughout the United States. Rights-based reductionism and zealotry threaten the professional practice of abortion. Rights-based reductionism is generally the view that moral or ethical issues can be reduced exclusively to matters of rights. In relation to abortion, there are 2 opposing forms of rights-based reductionism, namely fetal rights reductionism, which emphasizes the rights for the fetus while disregarding the rights and autonomy of the pregnant patient, and pregnant patient rights reductionism, which supports unlimited abortion without regards for the fetus. The 2 positions are irreconcilable. This article provides historical examples of the destructive nature of zealotry, which is characterized by extreme devotion to one's beliefs and an intolerant stance to opposing viewpoints, and of the importance of enlightenment to limit zealotry. This article then explores the professional responsibility model as a clinically ethically sound approach to overcome the clashing forms of rights-based reductionism and zealotry and to address the professional practice of abortion. The professional responsibility model refers to the ethical and professional obligations that obstetricians and other healthcare providers have toward pregnant patients, fetuses, and the society at large. It provides a more balanced and nuanced approach to the abortion debate, avoiding the pitfalls of reductionism and zealotry, and allows both the rights of the woman and the obligations to pregnant and fetal patients to be considered alongside broader ethical, medical, and societal implications. Constructive and respectful dialogue is crucial in addressing diverse perspectives and finding common ground. Embracing the professional responsibility model enables professionals to manage abortion responsibly, thereby prioritizing patients' interests and navigating between absolutist viewpoints to find balanced ethical solutions.

### Taking STOX: developing a cross disciplinary methodology for systematic reviews of research on the built environment and the health of the public [^3a2621d5]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To develop a cross disciplinary literature search methodology for conducting systematic reviews of all types of research investigating aspects of the built environment and the health of the public.

Design

The method was developed following a comprehensive search of literature in the area of housing and injuries, using 30 databases covering many disciplines including medicine, social science, architecture, science, engineering, environment, planning and psychology. The results of the database searches, including the type (or evidence) of research papers identified, were analysed to identify the most productive databases and improve the efficiency of the strategy. The revised strategy for literature searching was then applied to the area of neighbourhoods and mental health, and an analysis of the evidence type of references was carried out. In recognition of the large number and variety of observational studies, an expanded evidence type classification was developed for this purpose.

Main Results

From an analysis of 722 citations obtained by a housing and injuries search, an overlap of only 9% was found between medical and social science databases and only 1% between medical and built environment databases. A preliminary evidence type classification of those citations that could be assessed (from information in the abstracts and titles) suggested that the majority of intervention studies on housing and injuries are likely to be found in the medical and social science databases. A number of relevant observational studies (10% of all research studies) would have been missed, however, by excluding built environment and grey literature databases. In an area lacking in interventional research (housing/neighbourhoods and mental health) as many as 25% of all research studies would have been missed by ignoring the built environment and grey literature.

Conclusions

When planning a systematic review of all types of evidence in a topic relating to the built environment and the health of the public, a range of bibliographical databases from various disciplines should be considered.

If Tri-Nymyo is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Tri-Nymyo.

Second-trimester

Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Tri-Nymyo, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle pack of Tri-Nymyo [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling .]

Starting Tri-Nymyo after Childbirth

Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Tri-Nymyo following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception.
Tri-Nymyo is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Tri-Nymyo. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

Compact Blister Dispenser

If the patient starts pill-taking on Sunday, the first active pill should be taken on the first Sunday after the patient's menstrual period begins. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Sunday) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

If the patient will start pill-taking on "Day 1", place a day-label sticker on the compact which starts with the day of the week the patient will take the first pill. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Day 1) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^69dbc09e]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Medication disposal — FDA guidelines recommend the following actions: taking advantage of programs that allow the public to take unused drugs to a central location for proper disposal, with local law enforcement agencies that may sponsor medicine take-back programs; city or county government household trash and recycling services may also have specific medication disposal options and guidelines; transferring unused medicines to collectors registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); pharmacies may also have drug disposal kiosks; if there are no disposal instructions on the label and no take-back program or disposal kits are available, medications can be thrown out in the household trash; before throwing out medications, removal of medications from their original containers and mixing them with an undesirable substance is recommended, and placement of the mixture in a sealable bag, empty can, or other container will prevent the drug from leaking or breaking out of a garbage bag.

### The impact of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control in defending legal challenges to tobacco control measures [^70767603]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Demonstrating international consensus

A related use of the WHO FCTC was to demonstrate international consensus in relation to the need for a measure and the nature of the problem it addresses. x In BAT South Africa v Minister for Health, for example, an unsuccessful challenge to an advertising ban on the basis of freedom of commercial expression, the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa noted that 'South Africa… has international law obligations to ban tobacco advertising and promotion, and that this has been the practice in many other open and democratic societies'.n JTI v Canada (Attorney-General), in which tobacco companies unsuccessfully challenged an advertising ban and requirement for graphic health warnings covering 50% of the principal display areas of tobacco packs, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that:

Governments around the world are implementing anti-tobacco measures similar to and, in some cases, more restrictive than Canada's… The WHO Framework Convention stipulates that warning labels 'should' cover at least 50 percent and 'shall' cover at least 30 percent of the package.

In Philip Morris v Uruguay, the tribunal noted that the graphic health warnings implemented by Uruguay were based on the 'internationally accepted' principle in article 11 and its guidelines that large health warnings should be mandated on tobacco product packaging.

The WHO FCTC has also been used to demonstrate consensus about the seriousness of tobacco use as a public health problem. xi In C-830/10, the Colombian Constitutional Court cited the WHO FCTC to demonstrate that there was a global consensus that tobacco consumption had serious consequences for health and the environment. In BAT v Secretary of State for Health, the High Court of England and Wales stated that:

The FCTC contains at its heart two propositions of real significance for the present case. The first is that tobacco use is an 'epidemic' of global proportions which exerts a catastrophic impact upon health… The second… is that the tobacco companies have over multiple decades set out, deliberately and knowingly, to subvert attempts by government around the world to curb tobacco use and promote public health.

### Firearm-related injury and death in the United States: a call to action from 8 health professional organizations and the American bar association [^fca2d5b9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Deaths and injuries related to firearms constitute a major public health problem in the United States. In response to firearm violence and other firearm-related injuries and deaths, an interdisciplinary, interprofessional group of leaders of 8 national health professional organizations and the American Bar Association, representing the official policy positions of their organizations, advocate a series of measures aimed at reducing the health and public health consequences of firearms. The specific recommendations include universal background checks of gun purchasers, elimination of physician "gag laws", restricting the manufacture and sale of military-style assault weapons and large-capacity magazines for civilian use, and research to support strategies for reducing firearm-related injuries and deaths. The health professional organizations also advocate for improved access to mental health services and avoidance of stigmatization of persons with mental and substance use disorders through blanket reporting laws. The American Bar Association, acting through its Standing Committee on Gun Violence, confirms that none of these recommendations conflict with the Second Amendment or previous rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court.

### Abiraterone acetate [^121678bd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 X ULN is unknown.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — key points for inhalation of drugs emphasize that when therapy is inhaled, the importance of education and training in inhaler device technique cannot be over-emphasized; the choice of inhaler device has to be individually tailored and will depend on access, cost, prescriber, and patient's ability and preference; It is essential to provide instructions and to demonstrate the proper inhalation technique and to re-check at each visit that patients continue to use their inhaler correctly; and inhaler technique (and adherence to therapy) should be assessed before concluding that the current therapy is insufficient.

### Why I wrote my advance decision to refuse life-prolonging treatment: and why the law on sanctity of life remains problematic [^19f7263d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

This paper, pursuing themes indefatigably defended in this journal and elsewhere by Professors Jenny and Celia Kitzinger, explains what led me to write my own advance decision (AD) to refuse life-prolonging treatment if I become legally incapacitated to make my own healthcare decisions for longer than 3months and am medically assessed as very unlikely to regain such legal capacity. I attach my Advance Decision to Refuse Life Prolonging Treatment to the online version of this paper for comment advice and possible general interest. I argue that while a Supreme Court judgement in 2013, followed by a Court of Protection judgement in 2015 greatly ameliorate my earlier concerns about excessive judicial emphasis on the sanctity of life, certain current requirements in the Code of Practice to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and in the Rules of the Court of Protection, especially Practice Direction 9E, concerning permanent vegetative state and minimally conscious state, seem clearly to contradict aspects of that Supreme Court judgement. If the logical implications of those legal requirements were thoroughly implemented medical practice would be substantially and undesirably skewed towards provision of treatments to prolong life that are unwanted, non-beneficial and wasteful of healthcare resources. I urge that these legal requirements are modified to make them consistent with the Supreme Court's judgement in Aintree v James.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^593b7826]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of OXAYDO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: OXAYDO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXAYDO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating OXAYDO and when OXAYDO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

### Harnessing policy to promote inclusive medical product evidence: development of a reference standard and structured audit of clinical trial diversity policies [^16476ae0]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Currently, many variables are required to be reported and can be exported in a csv file from ClinicalTrials.gov entries, but the personal data of trial participants are generally not required for posting of trial registrations and results reporting or exportable when reported. Institutional review boards should evaluate planned enrollment goals in trial protocols for adequate diversity and representation, and consider requiring amendments before approval of unjustified goals. NASEM suggests that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should "amend its guidance for coverage with evidence development to require that study protocols include… a plan for recruiting… representative participants" and a remediation process if coverage with evidence development studies fail to meet defined goals. Notwithstanding the role of these and other stakeholders in improving inclusive clinical research, pharmaceutical companies are key players because they sponsor most clinical trials supporting FDA product approvals.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that many pharmaceutical companies did not have public policies on diversity in clinical trials, and those that were publicly available varied widely and lacked important commitments. Large companies were more likely than non-large companies to have public policies on diversity in clinical trials. Our findings suggest that biopharmaceutical company policies can be better leveraged to improve diversity in clinical research and implementation of FDA and other stakeholder guidance.

### Development and validation of a real-time prediction model for acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients [^6ab4601f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Predictive performance of the refitted models in application

With a probability cutoff of 0.45, the refitted model could predict AKI at a median of 72 h in advance, achieving a sensitivity of 89.4%, a specificity of 89.3%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.6% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 24.1% in the internal validation cohort. When we selected different cutoff values for different cohorts, similar or slightly lower results were observed in the external validation cohorts. With the optimal probability cutoffs chosen to ensure appropriate sensitivity and specificity for each cohort, the model could predict AKI at a median of 54–90 h in advance in external validation cohorts. For severe AKI, the refitted model could predict severe AKI at a median of 114 h in advance with a probability cutoff of 0.4, achieving a sensitivity of 90.9%, a specificity of 93.9%, an NPV of 99.8% and a PPV of 19.5% in internal validation. With the optimal probability cutoffs chosen for each cohort, the model could predict severe AKI at a median of 78–108 h in advance in external validation cohorts. Tables 4–5 demonstrate the predictive performance of the model for each prediction every 6 h in detecting AKI and severe AKI prior to the event during hospitalization using different probability cutoffs across five cohorts. Tables S4 - S5 show the predictive performance for each observation in detecting the outcome within 48 h at different probability cutoffs.

### Firearm laws and pediatric mortality in the US [^1a78b966]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Firearms are the leading cause of death in US children and adolescents, but little is known about whether the overall legal landscape was associated with excess mortality after a landmark US Supreme Court decision in 2010.

Objective

To measure excess mortality due to firearms among US children aged 0 to 17 years after the McDonald v Chicago US Supreme Court decision (2010).

Design, Setting, and Participants

An excess mortality analysis was conducted using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database before and after McDonald v Chicago, the landmark 2010 US Supreme Court decision on firearms regulation. States were divided into 3 groups based on legal actions taken before and since 2010, most permissive, permissive, and strict. Firearm mortality trends before (1999–2010) and after (2011–2023) were determined and compared across the 3 groups for all intents and by intent (homicide and suicide). Subgroup analysis by observed race and ethnicity was conducted. For each US state, pre-and post-McDonald v Chicago all-intent pediatric firearm mortality incident rates were compared. These data were analyzed January 2011 through December 2023.

Exposure

The pre- and post-McDonald v Chicago legal landscape.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Excess mortality during the post-McDonald v Chicago period.

Results

During the post-McDonald v Chicago period (2011–2023), there were 6029 excess firearm deaths (incidence rate [IR], 158.6 per million population; 95% CI, 154.8–162.5) in the most permissive group. In the permissive group, there were 1424 excess firearm deaths (IR, 107.5 per million person-years; 95% CI, 103.8–111.3). In the strict group, there were -55 excess firearm deaths (IR, -2.5 per million person-years; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.8). Non-Hispanic Black populations were had the largest increase in firearm mortality in the most permissive and permissive state groupings. Four states (California, Maryland, New York, and Rhode Island) had decreased pediatric firearm mortality after McDonald v Chicago, all of which were in the strict firearms law group.

Conclusion

States in the most permissive and permissive firearm law categories experienced greater pediatric firearm mortality during the post-McDonald v Chicago era. Future work should focus on determining which types of laws conferred the most harm and which offered the most protection.

### Policy and planning for large epidemics and pandemics-challenges and lessons learned from COVID-19 [^fdf6c4d8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global catastrophe that has led to untold suffering and death. Many previously identified policy challenges in planning for large epidemics and pandemics have been brought to the fore, and new ones have emerged. Here, we review key policy challenges and lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to be better prepared for the future.

Recent Findings

The most important challenges facing policymakers include financing outbreak preparedness and response in a complex political environment with limited resources, coordinating response efforts among a growing and diverse range of national and international actors, accurately assessing national outbreak preparedness, addressing the shortfall in the global health workforce, building surge capacity of both human and material resources, balancing investments in public health and curative services, building capacity for outbreak-related research and development, and reinforcing measures for infection prevention and control.

Summary

In recent years, numerous epidemics and pandemics have caused not only considerable loss of life, but billions of dollars of economic loss. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a wake-up call and led to the implementation of relevant policies and countermeasures. Nevertheless, many questions remain and much work to be done. Wise policies and approaches for outbreak control exist but will require the political will to implement them.

Therapeutic Use: Recommended dosage & range

Check the listed ingredients to verify that it matches the prescription ordered. When using a prescription set, verify the patient's name and the ingredients listed with the prescription order. Assess the patient's physical and emotional status prior to giving as injection. Do not give injections to patients who are in acute distress. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Dosage of allergenic extracts is a highly individualized matter and varies according to the degree of sensitivity of the patient, his clinical response and tolerance to the extract administered during the early phases of an injection regimen. The dosage must be reduced when transferring a patient from non-standardized or modified extract to standardized extract. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy as well as during maintenance therapy. After therapeutic injections patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes for reaction symptoms.

SUGGESTED DOSAGE SCHEDULE

The following schedule may act as a guide. This schedule has not been proven to be safe or effective. Sensitive patients may begin with smaller doses of weaker solutions and the dosage increments can be less.

Preparation Instructions:

All dilutions may be made using sterile buffered diluent. The calculation may be based on the following ratio:

### Prasugrel [^b398a874]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel tablets, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel tablets than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Trials (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4), and Clinical Studies (14)].

Doubt continues to surround the assassination of President Kennedy to this day. Unfortunately, the controversy was not diminished by the multiple commissions and panels that were convened to investigate it. This was in large part because these various panels continued to propagate much of the confusion and lack of precision that plagued the initial medical reports, and introduced some new confusion of their own. Much of this controversy was driven by incomplete information, poor documentation and analysis, and the puzzling decision to withhold key medical evidence both from investigators and the public. However, the preponderance of evidence does show that the single-shooter, three-bullet theory is plausible both medically and scientifically.

For patients prescribed maintenance treatment, "ask an empathic question" and "Acknowledge the likelihood of incomplete adherence and encourage an open non-judgmental discussion," using example prompts such as "In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it – not at all, 1, 2, 3 or more days a week?" and "Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or the evening?" Practical checks include "Check the date of the last prescription," "Check the date and dose counter on the inhaler," and, where available, electronic monitoring since "prescribing and dispensing frequency can be monitored electronically by clinicians and/or pharmacists."

### Institutionalising an evidence-informed approach to guideline development: progress and challenges at the World Health Organization [^a3481b9c]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

WHO's guideline development reforms do not currently apply to all normative outputs published from all of WHO's technical departments and scientific advisory committees

Many interviewees reported being involved with WHO advisory bodies known as 'scientific and technical advisory groups'. These bodies were described as "more informal than a guidelines review group because it's not tasked with making necessarily policy recommendations on treatments and use of diagnostics" (WHO Interviewee 15). Another interviewee characterised these bodies as not primarily dealing with scientific questions and technical issues, but rather the strategic direction of various WHO programmes:

It's an advisory body, and it's not just science and technical issues but it's also strategic issues for our programmatic response, so in that way it operates slightly differently from a group that would convene around one piece of scientific policy. But it broadly reflects on guidelines produced and the overall strategic direction for our program and fulfilling WHO's core functions. (WHO Interviewee 17)

However, several interviewees described these bodies as also producing guidelines and policy recommendations that should be subjected to the formal guideline development process. For example, one interviewee expressed that "from time to time, we most probably are putting out guidance that should really be graded for guideline recommendations" (WHO Interviewee 19). Interviewees also described cases of strategic attempts by WHO staff to circumvent the mandated guideline development process that is quality assured by the GRC. One interviewee raised that the resources and rules associated with the guideline development process could tempt staff to frame guidance documents in ways that enabled them to bypass the formal route, which risked issuing WHO recommendations without bringing all the available scientific evidence to the table:

So you're trying to figure out how do I frame this so that it doesn't really sound like a WHO guideline, so that I don't have to deal with all that process… Except that if you don't have to go through the rigorous process, then you're kind of on your own, you can do whatever you want to do. There's no oversight, there's no guidance on what ought to be part of that, and I think you end up not making the best recommendations. (WHO Interviewee 9)

### Genetic discrimination: introducing the Asian perspective to the debate [^4df71c06]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

India

A 2018 High Court of Delhi case — M/S United India Insurance Co. v. Jai Parkash Tayal — highlights the pervasive effect of GD as it relates to private health insurance and employment. The Court concluded that such discrimination did not adhere to proper standards of genetic testing and failed to comply with the test of intelligible differentia, a standard of natural justice and equity (The Constitution of India). However, the Supreme Court of India stayed this judgment and prevented the operative part of the Delhi High Court's judgment from transforming India's laws regarding GD. Indeed, the majority of employers and insurance providers in the country are in the private sector, and impleading the insurance regulator, the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India, is the right step to address potential GD in the insurance sector.

The Indian Council of Medical Research developed the National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants in 2017. The guidelines affirm that social stigmatization and discrimination in education, employment, health care, and general insurance are probable consequences of the irresponsible use and sharing of genetic research. The guidelines also specify the need to obtain informed consent for secondary uses of genetic information and prescribe norms relating to the maintenance of data confidentiality, as well as pre- and post-test counseling. However, these guidelines do not legally bind the scientific community, serving instead as ethical guidelines.

Japan

Japan does not have a law regulating discrimination based on personal genetic traits. While the Fundamental Principles of Research on the Human Genome issued in 2000 by the Bioethics Committee of the Council for Science and Technology addresses this topic, its normative strength is limited. The Principles state that "… regardless of their genetic characteristics, all individuals or groups of individuals are respected for their dignity and human rights, and that they are equal to one another and are not subjected to any form of discrimination."The subsequently adopted government guidelines for human genome research — Ethical Guidelines for Human Genome/Gene Analysis Research (2001) — do not mention GD.

However, recently, more active initiatives have emerged in Japan. In 2019, the Japanese insurance industry announced that guidelines banning life insurance companies from collecting or using personal genetic information for purposes related to coverage eligibility or premium calculations are being planned to prevent GD. In 2019, a non-partisan group of lawmakers approved the draft outline of a Bill to promote responsible use of patients' genetic information in disease treatment and to prevent GD.

### The child witness in the courtroom [^fff2b1b9]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Background — child witnesses in court: Children were first allowed to testify with the 1895 US Supreme Court decision allowing a 5.5-year-old to serve as a witness, and substantially more than 100 000 children appear in court each year. A 1982 Presidential Task Force on Victims of Crime recommended 62 reforms. Federal protections include options such as live testimony by 2-way closed-circuit television or videotaped testimony. The Uniform Child Witness by Alternative Methods Act in 2002 encouraged states to allow victims and witnesses younger than 13 years to testify by alternative methods, though it has only been enacted in a small number of states. The 2005 Attorney General's report provided for the appointment and payment of a guardian ad litem (GAL), but title 18 provides for GALs only in cases involving child abuse or exploitation in child welfare proceedings and criminal cases. Guidelines from the US Attorney General in 2005 state a primary goal is to reduce the trauma to child victims and witnesses caused by contact with the criminal justice system, and some states' codes apply only to victims of physical and sexual abuse, excluding children who witness violence, who are then covered by the federal statute.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Control of tuberculosis in large cities in developed countries: an organizational problem [^d0dac090]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The current economic crisis will have long-term impacts on communicable disease control and it is critical to keep the public health budget at an adequate level, although TB programs can increase their efficiency by improving their organizational structures. To take advantage of other resources for transmissible diseases, such as the resources for HIV prevention and for control of epidemic outbreaks, co-operation with other programs (including Immigration and IDU services) will be essential. Brigs stated in 1914 that 'Public health is purchasable; a community can determine its own death rate'. Following these ideas, Reichman strongly recommends fostering and maintaining the political will that allows enhancement of public health programs that can move towards the elimination of TB. Each city needs to define its needs according to its particular epidemiological situation, but the ratio of one nurse per forty TB cases, as suggested by Bothamley and colleagues, is a very good starting point.

### Designing, conducting and reporting clinical research. A step by step approach [^c06e9c42]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

There are five major steps that one must navigate successfully to take a study idea and turn it into a publication that may have an impact on clinical practice. These steps include developing the study question(s), developing the study plan, implementing the study plan, reporting the results and submitting the manuscript(s) for publication. This review takes each of these steps and expands on its important components. More detail is given for steps one, two and five. Furthermore, the review is augmented with tables and checklists that may serve as tools in the planning and execution of a clinical study. Though it does not address every detail for each of the steps discussed, readers of all experience levels should find it a useful tool in the planning, execution and reporting of their next clinical study.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^992d7a04]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 5–2. Choice and effective use of inhaler devices — Choose the most appropriate inhaler device for the patient before prescribing and consider the preferred medication, available devices, patient skills, environmental impact and cost; if different options are available, encourage the patient to participate in the choice, ensure that there are no physical barriers that limit use of the inhaler, and avoid use of multiple different inhaler types where possible to avoid confusion; for pMDIs, use of a spacer improves delivery and (with ICS) reduces the potential for side-effects. Check inhaler technique at every opportunity, ask the patient to show you how they use their inhaler (don't just ask if they know how to use it), and identify any errors using a device-specific checklist. Show the patient how to use the device correctly with a physical demonstration and check technique again, paying attention to problematic steps, noting that you may need to repeat this process 2–3 times within the same session; consider an alternative device only if the patient cannot use the inhaler correctly after several repeats of training, and re-check inhaler technique frequently because after initial training, errors often recur within 4–6 weeks. Clinicians should be able to demonstrate correct technique for each of the inhalers they prescribe, and pharmacists and nurses can provide highly effective inhaler skills training.

### School-aged children who are not progressing academically: considerations for pediatricians [^fed096dc]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Academic progress difficulties in school-aged children — summary recommendations state: Pediatricians should take an active role in the prevention, early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of academic progress problems, and to this end, pediatricians should be knowledgeable of relevant AAP resources that allow them to effectively manage the care of school-aged children who are not progressing academically. Care coordination for children who are not progressing academically should take place in the context of the child's medical home, and team-based care must include the pediatrician, specialists, and other health and human services professionals and families, regardless of the location of, or source of payment for, these services. Payment for all the activities, including non– face-to-face visits and coordination required to provide high-quality care to children who are not progressing academically, should be considered by payers. Pediatricians need to understand the rights that all children in the United States have to receive a free and appropriate public education, including those with learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, and chronic health conditions, and understanding these rights allows pediatricians to most effectively support families as they advocate for evaluations and interventions in the public school. Pediatricians should be familiar with the AAP clinical report on IDEA30 so that they are familiar with the law, the processes, and the challenges of the IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Considerations when choosing an approach to evaluation need to include the depth of evaluation necessary, the complexity of the intervention that will be required, the resource costs to families for the various options, and the level of coverage by insurance plan(s) for the recommended evaluations. Pediatricians can most effectively serve their patients by establishing relationships with colleagues who can conduct further diagnostic evaluations when a school-aged child is not progressing academically, including subspecialists (such as developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurologists, physiatrists, and child and adolescent psychiatrists), psychologists, neuropsychologists, allied health professionals (such as occupational, physical, and speech therapists), and school nurses. Pediatricians can develop an understanding of the different goals of evaluations to guide families to the most appropriate resources. Pediatricians should understand that the purpose of school psychology evaluations is to determine eligibility for education supports, and the purpose of evaluations by psychologists and neuropsychologists is to determine diagnoses and interventions. In schools, interventions are determined by the goals and objectives written in IEPs or 504 plans. Pediatricians may take an active role in the initiation, development, and implementation of IEPs and 504 plans when applicable.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^ec006ee8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

### Role and value of the corporate medical director [^4fc1d702]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Corporate medical director (CMD) qualifications and experience — In most developed countries, including the US, broad health and management experience is highly useful before taking the role of CMD, and ideally, the candidate should hold an unrestricted license to practice medicine in her or his home headquarters country although that may not be a requirement in every organization or country. He or she should also achieve board certification, a recognized specialist accreditation in occupational medicine or the more preferred double certification in occupational medicine and another board such as internal medicine or family medicine, and further qualifications such as a master of public health or masters-level degree in environmental health, business administration, or law are highly desirable, including knowledge of epidemiology, biostatistics, population health management, business management, and regulatory aspects of employee health. CMDs should also remain active in their relevant professional health organizations to demonstrate that they are remaining current in medicine, and before taking on the role of CMD, it is advantageous to have at least 10 or more years of practical experience as an occupational health physician, preferably within a global setting, including at least 5 years in a leadership role managing physicians and other licensed health care professionals.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f361165a]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Spirometry — considerations in performing spirometry (Figure 2.4) state that forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. Preparation includes that spirometers should produce hard copy or have a digital display of the expiratory curve to permit detection of technical errors or have an automatic prompt to identify an unsatisfactory test and the reason for it. During performance, the pause between inspiration and expiration should be less than one second, the recording should go on long enough for a volume plateau to be reached, which may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease, and both FVC and FEV1 should be the largest value obtained from any of three technically satisfactory curves and the FVC and FEV1 values in these three curves should vary by no more than 5% or 150 mL, whichever is greater; the FEV1/FVC ratio should be taken from the technically acceptable curve with the largest sum of FVC and FEV1. For bronchodilation testing, possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short-acting beta2-agonist, 160 mcg short-acting anticholinergic, or the two combined; FEV1 should be measured 10–15 minutes after a short-acting beta2-agonist is given, or 30–45 minutes after a short-acting anticholinergic or a combination of both classes of drugs, and patients already on bronchodilator treatment, in whom spirometry is requested for monitoring purposes do not need to stop their regular treatment for spirometry. For evaluation, spirometry measurements are evaluated by comparison of the results with appropriate reference values based on age, height and sex, and the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

-Fenoprofen Calcium, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS - Cardiovascular Effects).
-Fenoprofen Calcium, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS - Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
-Fenoprofen Calcium, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
-Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.
-Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
-Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
-Starting at 30-weeks gestation, Fenoprofen Calcium and other NSAIDs should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur.

### The ambiguous role of alcohol in economic and social development [^c408429e]. Addiction (2000). Low credibility.

An increased and industrialized alcohol supply in a developing society is usually assumed to have positive effects on economic development, although it may be recognized that the effects on public health and order will be negative. There has been little attention to the potential for negative effects on the economic side. This paper directs attention to such factors as unemployment for cottage producers (often female heads of household) and reduced industrial employment as highly-automated "turnkey" brewers are installed. On the other hand, changes in the mode of production of alcoholic beverages may have little impact on the much larger work-force involved in serving or selling alcohol in retail trade. The net contribution of an increased and industrialized alcohol supply in terms of economic development is unclear, but industrialization and development bring with them increased demands for attention and sobriety, e.g. in motorized traffic and on the production line, which increased drinking may undercut. Decisions by international development agencies on investment in alcohol production and distribution should take account of both the positive and negative impacts on economic development as well as on public health. In line with this, the World Bank has recently decided to invest in alcohol industry projects only when there is a strong positive development impact and the project is "consistent with public health issues and social policy concerns".

### Addressing a crisis in abortion access: a case study in advocacy [^91354fcb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

On December 1, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a Mississippi case, Dobbs v Jackson. Experts who listened to the arguments and questions from the Justices agree that the current federal protections for abortion established by Roe v Wade (hereinafter " Roe ")will be significantly weakened. Access will be particularly restricted for people who need abortions later in pregnancy. In 2021 alone, there have been 108 abortion restrictions enacted in 19 states, the highest total in any year since the 1973 Roe decision, most of which dramatically reduce the upper gestational age for abortion care.

Prohibiting abortion does not remove the need for abortion, but instead exacerbates the economic stratification between who can and cannot access care. People need later abortions for many of the same reasons people need abortions earlier in pregnancy. Studies show that many of those who seek abortion care after 20 weeks of gestation wanted an earlier abortion but faced financial hurdles and legal barriers, including the need to travel for care. For others, new information such as a fetal diagnosis may arise later in pregnancy. And for others still, circumstances change and a wanted pregnancy becomes untenable, for example when a partner leaves or dies, a young child develops a serious illness, or someone in the family loses their job or health insurance. In all of these circumstances, the ability to access later care is essential and yet has constricted over the past decade. It is anticipated that at least 22 states will quickly restrict abortion if the Supreme Court weakens federal protections, either following Texas' example of banning abortion after an early point in pregnancy or falling in step with a currently enjoined Alabama law banning all abortions. These bans will result in people from these states traveling long distances to access services and will place a burden on clinicians who provide abortion in neighboring states, particularly for later abortion care.

It is critical that facilities expand their capacity to provide abortion care to those who will travel for care wherever possible. This article highlights the effort of the public health care system in New York City to expand access to later abortion care.
