HIV-1/2 combination antigen/antibody test: positive
HIV 1/2 differentiation assay: negative for HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibodies
HIV RNA: negative
These results most likely represent:

a) False positive tests

b) Cross reaction from another virus such as HCV

c) Very late infection

d) Recent infection

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret HIV test results in a 19-year-old pregnant woman, specifically a positive 4th-generation HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody screen, a negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and a negative HIV RNA, and what the most likely explanation for this pattern is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the CDC/APHL diagnostic algorithm and how this result pattern maps onto it. Then, I should verify the expected patterns for acute HIV-1 infection, established HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection, and false-positive screening. Next, I will consider pregnancy-specific nuances and the timing of testing. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely explanation and outline immediate next steps and counseling points, making sure I double-check for any alternative explanations like HIV-2 or cross-reactivity before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the testing sequence and what each result means in the algorithm. A reactive 4th-generation HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combination assay detects HIV-1 p24 antigen and HIV-1/2 antibodies, but it does not distinguish HIV-1 from HIV-2; therefore, a supplemental antibody differentiation assay is required to assign type, and if that differentiation is negative or indeterminate, an HIV-1 NAT is used to resolve acute infection versus a false-positive screen, which is exactly what was done here [^1166x3xB] [^112wZ2ai].

> Now, I should verify the expected pattern for acute HIV-1 infection. In acute HIV-1, the Ag/Ab screen is typically reactive because p24 antigen appears before IgG antibodies, the differentiation assay is negative or indeterminate because IgG has not yet developed, and the HIV-1 RNA is detectable; in fact, RNA can be detected roughly 10 days after infection, whereas the Ag/Ab assay becomes reactive around 18 days, so the triad of Ag/Ab positive, differentiation negative, and RNA positive is classic for acute HIV-1 infection [^114dxX4A] [^114EpQpT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the actual results here. The differentiation assay is negative and the HIV RNA is negative, which contradicts the expected acute HIV-1 pattern that requires detectable RNA, so this is not acute HIV-1 infection despite the reactive screen, and I should confirm that the algorithm explicitly interprets this combination as a false-positive initial immunoassay rather than early infection [^1166CBsE] [^116yfioH].

> Next, I should review what established HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection would look like. Established HIV-1 infection would show a reactive differentiation assay for HIV-1 antibodies, and established HIV-2 infection would show HIV-2 antibodies on differentiation. Dual infection would show both, so a completely negative differentiation with a negative RNA argues against established HIV-1, HIV-2, or dual infection in this case, especially given the rarity of HIV-2 in the United States and the lack of detectable RNA to suggest viremia [^113wSE1t] [^117A9Y9J] [^111ZwbNE].

> I will now examine the possibility of a false-positive screen and whether pregnancy modifies that risk. Pregnancy is associated with a measurable increase in false-positive 4th-generation results, with cohort data showing a false-positive rate around 0.16% and a positive predictive value near 83% in pregnant populations; importantly, the combination of a reactive Ag/Ab screen, negative differentiation, and negative RNA is the canonical definition of a false-positive screen in the CDC algorithm, and this pattern has been repeatedly documented in pregnancy, including reports of false-positive Architect results and case reports of vaccine-associated seroreactivity with rapid seroreversion [^113Kyzao] [^116ZN7LG] [^116LCkEX] [^114mjrGd].

> Wait, let me verify whether any alternative explanations fit better. Cross-reactivity from HCV could theoretically cause serologic cross-reactivity, but in the modern 4th-generation algorithm this is not a recognized driver of this specific discordant pattern, and the absence of detectable RNA makes acute infection unlikely. Very late infection would present with positive antibodies on the differentiation assay, not negative, so that does not fit either, reinforcing that the most parsimonious explanation is a false-positive screen in pregnancy [^113Kyzao] [^1166CBsE].

> I should double-check the immediate next steps and counseling. The correct interpretation is a false-positive screening test with no laboratory evidence of HIV infection; no treatment is indicated, and the patient should be reassured while arranging repeat HIV testing in about 2 to 4 weeks to document seronegativity and exclude laboratory or biologic variability, with consideration of risk-based retesting later in pregnancy if indicated; in pregnancy, if a positive screen occurs late in gestation or intrapartum, many centers run RNA concurrently with differentiation to avoid delays, but in this case the negative RNA already resolves the question [^116yfioH] [^113Kyzao] [^116F7Xqc].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating the window period? Let me reconsider the timing. The RNA assay can detect infection as early as about 10 days and the Ag/Ab assay by about 18 days, so if this patient were in the acute window, the RNA should be positive; the negative RNA with negative differentiation makes acute infection exceedingly unlikely, and repeating the antibody testing in a few weeks should remain negative if this was a false-positive, which aligns with the algorithm's guidance to follow discordant nonreactive differentiation plus negative RNA with repeat testing rather than treatment [^114dxX4A] [^1166CBsE].

> Final synthesis: The most likely explanation for a reactive 4th-generation HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab screen, negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation, and negative HIV RNA in this 19-year-old pregnant patient is a false-positive screening test, particularly given the known increase in false positives during pregnancy and the algorithmic definition of this pattern as no laboratory evidence of HIV infection, so the correct answer is a) False positive tests [^113Kyzao] [^1166CBsE] [^116yfioH].

---

The most likely explanation for a positive HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab screen, negative HIV-1/2 differentiation, and negative HIV RNA in a 19-year-old pregnant woman is **false-positive screening** [^1166CBsE] due to nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity in pregnancy [^113Kyzao] [^112se8SY]. This pattern is **not consistent with acute HIV** (which would have detectable RNA) [^114dxX4A] or established infection (which would have positive differentiation) [^113wSE1t]. Confirm with repeat testing in 2–4 weeks and consider HIV-2 testing if clinically indicated [^116yfioH] [^115xoqFc].

## Interpretation of test results

| **Test** | **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab screen | Positive | Initial screen detects HIV antigen/antibodies |
| HIV-1/2 differentiation | Negative | No HIV-1/2 antibodies detected |
| HIV RNA | Negative | No detectable viral RNA |

---

This pattern — positive screen, negative differentiation, and negative RNA — is **most consistent with a false-positive screen** [^1166CBsE] [^116yfioH].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### False-positive screening test

- **Nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity**: Pregnancy can cause nonspecific antibody production, leading to false-positive screens [^114mjrGd] [^1154SVoX].
- **Assay-specific false positives**: The ARCHITECT Ag/Ab assay has a false-positive rate of ~0.16% in pregnancy [^113Kyzao] [^116ZN7LG].
- **Immune activation**: Pregnancy-related immune changes can cause false positives [^114mjrGd].

---

### Acute HIV infection

In acute HIV infection, **RNA detection** occurs early, typically within 10–14 days [^114dxX4A]; a negative RNA makes acute infection unlikely [^116yfioH]. The **differentiation assay** is usually negative or indeterminate early, but RNA should be positive [^1166CBsE].

---

### Established HIV infection

In established HIV infection, **differentiation assay** should be positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies [^113wSE1t]; a negative result makes established infection unlikely [^114f4HpB].

---

### Cross-reactivity with other viruses

Cross-reactivity with HCV or other viruses is **possible but uncommon** with modern assays [^117HGqxM]; no clear evidence supports this here.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm with repeat HIV testing in 2–4 weeks [^notfound].
- **HIV-2 testing**: Consider HIV-2 testing if clinically indicated (e.g. West African origin) [^111ZwbNE].
- **Clinical correlation**: Use clinical history and risk assessment to guide further testing [^114Lz3rL].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most likely explanation is a **false-positive screen** [^1166CBsE] due to nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity in pregnancy [^114mjrGd]. Confirm with repeat testing in 2–4 weeks and consider HIV-2 testing if clinically indicated [^116yfioH] [^115xoqFc].

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1166x3xB]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations for HIV laboratory diagnosis state that laboratories should conduct initial testing for HIV with an FDA-approved antigen/antibody combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen, and no further testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay. Specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result should be tested with an FDA-approved antibody immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies, and reactive results on both the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV antibodies, undifferentiated. If the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is reactive and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is nonreactive or indeterminate, specimens should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT); a reactive HIV-1 NAT with a nonreactive differentiation immunoassay indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection, a reactive HIV-1 NAT with an indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates the presence of HIV-1 infection confirmed by HIV-1 NAT, and a negative HIV-1 NAT with nonreactive or indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. Laboratories should use this same testing algorithm, beginning with an antigen/antibody combination immunoassay, for serum or plasma specimens submitted after a reactive (preliminary positive) rapid HIV test; Exception: As of April 2014, data are insufficient to recommend use of the FDA-approved single-use rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay as the initial assay in the algorithm.

HIV testing and intrapartum management — If the initial HIV test result is negative (nonreactive), no further testing is required unless acute HIV infection is suspected. A positive antigen/antibody immunoassay or rapid HIV test result must be immediately followed by a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, as well as a maternal HIV RNA assay and an HIV NAT for the infant. For delivery units, every effort should be made to have the ability to run a confirmatory supplemental test (HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay) 7 days a week, and if possible, results of HIV RNA assays should be available in 24 hours or less. When there is a positive HIV test result or suspected acute HIV infection during labor, provide counseling about HIV test results and implications for care. Initiate intravenous zidovudine during labor. Immediately initiate presumptive HIV therapy appropriate for infants who are at high risk of perinatal HIV transmission. When there are plans to breastfeed, the Panel on Treatment of HIV During Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission strongly advises against initiating breastfeeding given the high risk of perinatal transmission, and breast milk should be expressed and stored appropriately; it should not be used for infant feeding unless all supplemental HIV test results are reviewed and determined to be negative.

Alternative testing sequences when tests in the recommended algorithm cannot be used — Based on the evidence review and expert opinion from stakeholders and the working group, CDC members of the writing group identified testing sequences that might be used to improve the laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection if an alternative FDA-approved assay is substituted for one of the classes of assays specified in the recommended algorithm, and replacing a recommended assay has limitations described below that may reduce the accuracy of the testing algorithm. Use of a 3rd generation HIV-1/2 antibody immunoassay instead of a 4th generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassay as the initial test: perform subsequent testing as specified in the recommended algorithm. Limitations: This alternative will miss some acute HIV-1 infections in antibody-negative persons that would be detected by 4th generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassays. Use of the HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 IFA as the second test in the algorithm instead of an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay: if test results are negative or indeterminate, perform HIV-1 NAT; if HIV-1 NAT is negative, perform HIV-2 antibody immunoassay.

### Increase in false-positive fourth-generation human immunodeficiency virus tests in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^114F63m2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

While all potential confounding variables could not be eliminated, neither COVID-19 vaccination nor pregnancy changed the association of FP HIV results with concurrent COVID-19 infection, although we did not control for time from vaccination or period of gestation. We manually chart-reviewed all FP tests to determine if there was another etiology for their result. No other known alternative explanations were found.

The exact biochemistry of falsely reactive tests is often unknown and attributed to a "general" inflammatory process, to which COVID-19 is no stranger. While we were unable to link the degree of inflammation to false HIV positivity, we were able to show that HIV Ag reactivity was a primary trigger for an FP result on the test used in this study. A major strength of our study is that it included many patients, and all positive fourth-generation assay results, that is, TP, FP, and selected PN (in suspected acute HIV), were tracked by CTR program staff to confirm or reject an HIV diagnosis.

In conclusion, acute COVID-19 should be considered as a potential etiology for an FP fourth-generation HIV test.

HIV testing algorithm — initial reactive results indicates that reactive specimens should be tested in reflex with HIV antibody differentiation immunoassays that distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2; if the antibody differentiation result is negative, further testing with a qualitative or quantitative NAAT is recommended to rule out acute HIV infection; if positive, viral load testing and CD4 cell count determination are recommended to guide management. Use of HIV antibody-only immunoassays is limited to non-acute HIV-1 infection, and reactive initial serology should be tested further with HIV antibody differentiation assays for confirmation. Individuals with initially reactive results from whole blood, serum, plasma, or saliva tested with rapid antibody-only or Ag-Ab combination assays should be tested further with laboratory-based Ag-Ab immunoassays. The current APHL/CDC HIV testing algorithm no longer recommends supplemental HIV-1 antibody testing by Western blot.

Acute HIV infection in pregnancy — window periods and testing sequence: Clinicians should assess risk of acute HIV infection during pregnancy, particularly late in pregnancy. The antigen/antibody immunoassay may detect infection as early as 18 days after infection; antibody-only assays may not detect infection until as long as 45 days post-infection, and during this period the person with acute HIV will be viremic, with a high risk of perinatal transmission. The HIV RNA assay can detect the presence of HIV as early as 10 days post-infection. When acute HIV infection is suspected during pregnancy, during the intrapartum period, or while breastfeeding, a plasma HIV RNA assay should be performed in conjunction with an antigen/antibody immunoassay.

Discussion

These results are consistent with the previously reported findings from 1987–2009 that HIV-2 remains a rare diagnosis in the United States. Use of the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test increased steadily throughout the study period, although after 2014 the number of confirmed or probable HIV-2 infections remained stable. The number of persons with confirmed HIV-1 infection who had a false-positive HIV-2 test result by using the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test was greater than the total number of confirmed and probable HIV-2 diagnoses combined. In these cases, HIV antibody cross-reactivity likely caused the false-positive reaction and necessitated additional time and testing to resolve.

Although HIV-2 is rare, correct diagnosis is vital for ensuring correct clinical management. Persons with HIV-2 who have an incorrect HIV-1 diagnosis and are treated with nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, to which HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant, might fail to suppress an HIV-2 viral load. Without commercially available HIV-2 viral load tests, HIV-2 infection might not be recognized, or might require additional testing to determine HIV status. This step might include having to send specimens to specialized laboratories that perform a laboratory-developed HIV-2 NAT.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the definition used to define HIV-2 infection using test results entered into the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System, § (an application for collecting, storing, and retrieving HIV-related data), was developed for use with surveillance data to report epidemiologic trends. Identification of type of HIV diagnosis for the management of patients might require additional diagnostic tests that are beyond the scope of this study. Second, for 61 (33%) HIV-2 diagnoses (probable and confirmed) with missing HIV-1 NAT results, the possibility of HIV-2 infection or identification of dual infection could not be ruled out. An HIV-2 NAT might also have helped confirm these infections, but no FDA-approved commercially available test exists. Moreover, HIV-2 infection results in lower levels of circulating virus compared with those of HIV-1 infection. Finally, evidence of pregnancy in women with HIV infection is underreported to NHSS. Although this can result in an underestimation of the number of pregnant women with HIV-2, reporting of perinatal HIV infection is robust, thus increasing the likelihood that perinatal HIV-2 infection would have been recognized.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1136qwWr]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing for HIV infection — methodological limitations and comparability issues are described: available studies evaluated tests and algorithms against different reference standards for a laboratory diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection, and some assays used were not FDA-approved for HIV diagnosis, reducing comparability across studies; no studies conducted all assays on all specimens, and initiating testing with different immunoassays or conducting pooled HIV-1 NAT on immunoassay-negative specimens might result in selection bias and reduce comparability; studies of previously tested specimen sets often did not specify whether personnel were "blinded", which might have resulted in biased interpretation, especially for assays requiring subjective interpretation; longitudinal seroconversion panels typically have small numbers of subjects and may not be representative; and the 4th generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassays were only recently FDA-approved for clinical use, limiting study number and size and resulting in wide confidence intervals for some point estimates.

Diagnostic testing in children with postnatal HIV exposure outlines age-appropriate testing based on exposure history and age. Infants and children with potential HIV exposure after birth require age-appropriate testing, and infants with perinatal HIV exposure who have additional exposures after birth require HIV nucleic acid test (NAT) testing for diagnosis. Infants aged < 18 months who were not exposed to HIV at delivery and infants aged ≥ 18 months with these potential exposures require HIV antigen/antibody testing, unless timing places the patient in the seroconversion window when an HIV NAT is more sensitive; repeat testing may still be required.

Analytic framework — CDC writing group members conducted a systematic literature review to compare outcomes of previous and proposed HIV testing algorithm recommendations, and evaluated evidence using criteria adapted to relevant study designs within an analytic framework linking key questions to outcomes related to performance of individual assays and their use in combinations. The evidence synthesis focused on the relative effects of previous and recommended testing algorithms on diagnostic accuracy and yield. Benefits were defined as tests or algorithms classifying specimens as true-positive or true-negative for HIV-1 or HIV-2, and as reduced turnaround time, whereas harms included being classified as false-positive or false-negative, receiving indeterminate or inconclusive results, and delayed diagnosis due to the need for additional specimens or follow-up testing. Services after diagnosis for persons with HIV and for those identified as uninfected would be needed regardless of which testing algorithm is used.

HIV-2 diagnostic testing algorithm — Using the currently recommended HIV testing algorithm, people with HIV-2 infection will have positive results on a standard HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody or HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody immunoassay, which will prompt testing with a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay; individuals with HIV-2 mono-infection will test negative for HIV-1 antibodies and positive for HIV-2 antibodies, whereas both tests will be positive for individuals with HIV-1/HIV-2 co-infection. In the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) algorithm, the first step is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination assay on serum or plasma (e.g. Abbott Architect HIV Ag/Ab combo assay, Bio-Rad GS Combo Ag/Ab EIA, Alere Determine), which does not distinguish between HIV-1 antibodies and HIV-2 antibodies; reactive specimens must be tested with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved antibody assay to distinguish HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies, and the FDA-approved HIV-2 antibody supplemental test Geenius (Bio-Rad Laboratories) is used as part of the CDC-recommended laboratory testing algorithm.

June 27 marks the 20th annual observance of National HIV Testing Day, which promotes testing as an important first step in a strategy to detect, treat, and prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV testing is entering a new era in the United States because of Food and Drug Administration approval of 1) combination tests that detect both HIV antigen and antibody, and 2) tests that accurately differentiate HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. As a result, CDC has issued new guidelines, now available online, for HIV testing of serum or plasma specimens: Laboratory Testing for the Diagnosis of HIV Infection: Updated Recommendations. Testing begins with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. All specimens reactive on this initial assay undergo supplemental testing with an immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. Specimens that are reactive on the initial immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the antibody differentiation assay proceed to HIV-1 nucleic acid testing for resolution.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^112C2unG]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection — updated recommendations describe a recommended algorithm as a sequence of tests used in combination to improve the accuracy of diagnosis from serum or plasma specimens; CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories issued these recommendations based on FDA-approved tests as of December 2012 with evidence collected from 2007 through December 2013. The recommendations do not include the rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination test approved by the FDA in August 2013 or HIV-2 nucleic acid tests (NATs), which lack FDA approval. The report provides recommendations to laboratory personnel for adults and children > 24 months of age, and in brief, testing begins with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. The need for updated testing reflects FDA approval of improved HIV assays that allow detection sooner after infection, evidence that relying on Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay for confirmation can produce false-negative or indeterminate results early, recognition that risk of HIV transmission from persons with acute and early infection is much higher than that from persons with established infection, recent indications for the clinical benefits from antiretroviral treatment of all persons with HIV infection including those with acute infection, and demonstration that the majority of HIV-2 infections detected by available HIV antibody immunoassays are misclassified as HIV-1 by the HIV-1 Western blot.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^112wZ2ai]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection — CDC and APHL recommend that laboratories conduct the following sequence of assays with serum or plasma specimens for the accurate diagnosis of HIV infection. Laboratories should conduct initial testing for HIV with an FDA-approved antigen/antibody combination (4th generation) immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen to screen for established infection with HIV-1 or HIV-2 and for acute HIV-1 infection. No further testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay. Specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result (or repeatedly reactive, if repeat testing is recommended by the manufacturer or required by regulatory authorities) should be tested with an FDA-approved antibody immunoassay. Initial testing with a 4th generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassay detects more acute HIV-1 infections than initial testing with a 3rd generation antibody immunoassay and identifies comparable numbers of established HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections, with comparable specificity. These updated recommendations for testing of serum or plasma specimens supersede the 1989 recommendations for interpretation and use of the HIV-1 Western blot in the serologic diagnosis of HIV Type 1 infections, the 1992 recommendations for testing for antibodies to HIV Type 2 in the United States, and the 2004 recommended protocol for confirmation of rapid HIV tests, and because none of the assays in the recommended algorithm are FDA-approved for use with oral fluid or dried blood spot specimens, these updated recommendations do not supersede previous recommendations for testing of dried blood spots or oral fluid for HIV-1 using the FDA-approved immunoassay and HIV-1 Western blot. Exception: As of April 2014, data are insufficient to recommend use of the FDA-approved single-use rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay as the initial assay in the algorithm.

Screening Recommendations

The following recommendations apply to testing for HIV:

HIV testing is recommended for all persons seeking STI evaluation who are not already known to have HIV infection. Testing should be routine at the time of the STI evaluation, regardless of whether the patient reports any specific behavioral risks for HIV. Testing for HIV should be performed at the time of STI diagnosis and treatment if not performed at the initial STI evaluation and screening.
CDC and USPSTF recommend HIV screening at least once for all persons aged 15–65 years.
Persons at higher risk for HIV acquisition, including sexually active gay, bisexual, and other MSM, should be screened for HIV at least annually. Providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent screening (e.g. every 3–6 months) among MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV.
All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the first prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, preferably at < 36 weeks' gestation, should be considered and is recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring HIV infection, women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV, and women examined in clinical settings in which HIV incidence is ≥ 1 per 1,000 women screened per year.
HIV screening should be voluntary and free from coercion. Patients should not be tested without their knowledge.
Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV test will be performed, unless the patient declines) is recommended in all health care settings. CDC also recommends that consent for HIV screening be incorporated into the general informed consent for medical care in the same manner as other screening or diagnostic tests.
Requirement of specific signed consent for HIV testing is not recommended. General informed consent for medical care is considered sufficient to encompass informed consent for HIV testing.
Providers should use a laboratory-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination assay as the first test for HIV, unless persons are unlikely to follow up with a provider to receive their HIV test results; in those cases screening with a rapid POC test can be useful.
Preliminary positive screening tests for HIV should be followed by supplemental testing to establish the diagnosis.
Providing prevention counseling as part of HIV screening programs or in conjunction with HIV diagnostic testing is not required. However, persons might be more likely to think about HIV and consider their risk-related behavior when undergoing an HIV test. HIV testing gives providers an opportunity to conduct STI and HIV prevention counseling and communicate risk-reduction messages.
Acute HIV infection can occur among persons who report recent sexual or needle-sharing behavior or who have had an STI diagnosis.
Providers should test for HIV RNA if initial testing according to the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC is negative or indeterminate when concerned about acute HIV infection.
Providers should not assume that a laboratory report of a negative HIV Ag/Ab or antibody test indicates that the requisite HIV RNA testing for acute HIV infection has been conducted. They should consider explicitly requesting HIV RNA testing when concerned about early acute HIV infection.
Providers should assess eligibility of all persons seeking STI services for HIV PrEP and PEP. For persons with substantial risk whose results are HIV negative, providers should offer or provide referral for PrEP services, unless the last potential HIV exposure occurred < 72 hours, in which case PEP might be indicated.

Diagnostic testing for HIV infection — All patients with signs or symptoms consistent with HIV infection or an opportunistic illness characteristic of AIDS should be tested for HIV. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for acute HIV infection in all patients who have a compatible clinical syndrome and who report recent high-risk behavior, and when acute retroviral syndrome is a possibility, a plasma RNA test should be used in conjunction with an HIV antibody test to diagnose acute HIV infection. Patients or persons responsible for the patient's care should be notified orally that testing is planned, advised of the indication for testing and the implications of positive and negative test results, and offered an opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing. With such notification, the patient's general consent for medical care is considered sufficient for diagnostic HIV testing.

### Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112aUegM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Screening tests and diagnostic algorithm — Current CDC guidelines recommend screening with an antigen/antibody immunoassay approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that detects HIV‑1 and HIV‑2 antibodies and the HIV‑1 p24 antigen, with supplemental testing following a reactive assay to differentiate HIV‑1 and HIV‑2 antibodies; if supplemental testing for HIV‑1/HIV‑2 antibodies is nonreactive or indeterminate (or if acute HIV infection or recent exposure is suspected or reported), an HIV‑1 nucleic acid test is recommended to differentiate acute HIV‑1 infection from a false‑positive test result. Antigen/antibody tests for HIV are highly accurate and results can be available in 2 days; rapid antigen/antibody tests are also available, and when using a rapid HIV test for screening, positive results should be confirmed.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^111cNGqF]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antigen/antibody assays in infants — limitations and age-specific confirmation: Antibody tests, including antigen/antibody combination immunoassays, do not establish the presence of HIV in infants because transplacentally transferred antibodies may be detected; therefore, a virologic test must be used. Antigen/antibody combination immunoassays that detect HIV-1/2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen are not recommended for diagnosis of HIV infection in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure, and in the first months of life the antigen component is less sensitive than an HIV NAT, so antibody tests should not be used for HIV diagnosis in infants and children aged < 18 months. For children with perinatal HIV exposure who are aged ≥ 18 months who remain HIV antibody–positive, definitive confirmation should be based on a NAT.

Timing of HIV testing in pregnancy — To promote informed and timely therapeutic decisions, health-care providers should test women for HIV as early as possible during each pregnancy, and women who decline early should be encouraged to be tested at a subsequent visit. A second HIV test during the third trimester, preferably < 36 weeks of gestation, is cost-effective even in areas of low HIV prevalence and may be considered for all pregnant women. A second HIV test during the third trimester is recommended for women in facilities where prenatal screening identifies at least one HIV-infected pregnant woman per 1,000 women screened, for women at high risk for acquiring HIV, and for women with signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection; when acute retroviral syndrome is a possibility, a plasma RNA test should be used with an HIV antibody test to diagnose acute HIV infection.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — required supplemental assays: The recommended algorithm requires a lower number of assays than the previous algorithms for accurate HIV-1 and HIV-2 results, with both including 1 initial assay and 1 or 2 supplemental assays; the recommended algorithm requires one supplemental assay if HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies are present and, if the first supplemental assay is negative or indeterminate, requires a second supplemental assay, HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT), to test for acute HIV-1 infection and eliminate indeterminate results, with three studies showing that only 0.1% to 0.2% of all specimens required NAT testing, whereas the previous algorithm requires 1 supplemental assay to test for HIV-1 antibodies and, if negative or indeterminate, a second supplemental assay to test for HIV-2 antibodies, cannot identify acute HIV-1 infection and often needs a follow-up specimen, and produced indeterminate results in from 1.9% to 4.5% of repeatedly reactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassays; with both algorithms, HIV-1 antibody-positive specimens are resolved with 2 assays and initial false-positives require 3 tests.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1166CBsE]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — reactive results on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, undifferentiated. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend specific additional testing, without clinical follow-up, for specimens that are dually reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies on the differentiation immunoassay. Specimens that are reactive on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT). A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection. A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates the presence of HIV-1 antibodies confirmed by HIV-1 NAT. A negative HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive or indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. HIV-1 NAT results can distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from false-positive initial immunoassay results in specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay and a nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result. HIV-1 NAT does not detect HIV-2, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend testing for acute HIV-2 infection after a nonreactive HIV-1 NAT result.

Diagnostic Considerations

HIV infection can be diagnosed by HIV 1/2 Ag/Ab combination immunoassays. All FDA-cleared HIV tests are highly sensitive and specific. Available serologic tests can detect all known subtypes of HIV-1. The majority also detect HIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g. group O and group N).

According to an algorithm for HIV diagnosis, CDC recommends that HIV testing begin with a laboratory-based HIV-1/HIV-2 Ag/Ab combination assay, which, if repeatedly reactive, is followed by a laboratory-based assay with a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay. This algorithm confers an additional advantage because it can detect HIV-2 antibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is uncommon in the United States, accurate identification is vital because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from that for HIV-1. RNA testing should be performed on all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative supplemental antibody test results to determine whether the discordance represents acute HIV infection.

Rapid POC HIV tests can enable clinicians to make a preliminary diagnosis of HIV infection in < 20 minutes. The majority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the course of HIV infection than conventional laboratory-based assays and thus can produce negative results among persons recently infected (e.g. acutely infected persons). Furthermore, HIV home-test kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore will not detect acute HIV infection. If early or acute infection is suspected and a rapid HIV antibody assay is negative, confirmatory testing with combined laboratory-based assays or RNA testing should be performed. CDC recommends that all persons with reactive rapid tests be assessed with a laboratory-based Ag/Ab assay. Additional details about interpretation of results by using the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC are available at.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114EpQpT]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acute HIV infection — testing and interpretation: Quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA testing should be considered even if the HIV Ag/Ab test result is negative, and HIV infection should be confirmed by repeat quantitative HIV RNA testing or subsequent testing to document HIV antibody seroconversion. Even a low-positive quantitative HIV RNA level (e.g., < 200 copies/mL but detectable) in the setting of a negative or indeterminate antibody test result is consistent with acute HIV infection; when present at this level, the HIV RNA test should be repeated on a new blood specimen to confirm the diagnosis, and repeated false-positive HIV RNA test results are unlikely. HIV RNA levels in acute infection are generally very high (e.g., > 100,000 copies/mL), however, levels may be < 200 copies/mL in the earliest weeks, and a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result and a positive HIV RNA test result (< 200 copies/mL) indicate that acute HIV infection is highly likely. The previously proposed threshold of < 3,000 copies/mL is based on historical data that are now considered obsolete, and improvements in plasma viral load methodology suggest that any positive result on a quantitative plasma HIV RNA test in this setting may be consistent with acute HIV infection. In settings where testing algorithms use only anti-HIV antibodies, when acute HIV infection is suspected in a person with a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result, a quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA test should be performed.

### Trends in HIV-2 diagnoses and use of the HIV-1 / HIV-2 differentiation test-United States, 2010–2017 [^111gnVuN]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Since 2014, the recommended laboratory testing algorithm for diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has included a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test to confirm infection type on the basis of the presence of type-specific antibodies (1). Correctly identifying HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections is vital because their epidemiology and clinical management differ. To describe the percentage of diagnoses for which an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test result was reported and to categorize HIV type based on laboratory test results, 2010–2017 data from CDC's National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) were analyzed. During 2010–2017, a substantial increase in the number of HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test results were reported to NHSS, consistent with implementation of the HIV laboratory-based testing algorithm recommended in 2014. However, > 99.9% of all HIV infections identified in the United States were categorized as HIV-1, and the number of HIV-2 diagnoses (mono-infection or dual-infection) remained extremely low (< 0.03% of all HIV infections). In addition, the overall number of false positive HIV-2 test results produced by the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation increased. The diagnostic value of a confirmatory antibody differentiation test in a setting with sensitive and specific screening tests and few HIV-2 infections might be limited. Evaluation and consideration of other HIV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that might increase efficiencies in the CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories-recommended HIV testing algorithm are warranted.

### Human immunodeficiency virus infection: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^114sfSLF]. WPSI (2022). High credibility.

WPSI HIV screening — baseline and pregnancy: The Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) recommends all adolescent and adult women, ages 15 and older, receive a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at least once during their lifetime, and earlier or additional screening should be based on risk, with rescreening annually or more often that may be appropriate beginning at age 13 for adolescent and adult women with an increased risk of HIV infection. The WPSI also recommends risk assessment and prevention education beginning at age 13 and continuing as determined by risk. For pregnancy, a screening test for HIV is recommended for all pregnant women upon initiation of prenatal care with rescreening during pregnancy based on risk factors, and rapid HIV testing is recommended for pregnant women who present in labor with an undocumented HIV status.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^114B5bfP]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

CDC and APHL HIV diagnostic algorithm development is described: CDC and APHL laboratory experts proposed a new diagnostic algorithm that included 4th generation HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassays (approved by FDA in 2010 and 2011) and an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay. The proposed algorithm was intended to improve the accurate diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection and HIV-2 infection in the absence of clinical, behavioral, or demographic information that is not routinely available to laboratories. To validate the proposed algorithm for supplemental testing, CDC and public health laboratories retrospectively applied available existing test results in the sequence specified by the proposed algorithm and evaluated the 4th generation immunoassays and proposed algorithm on the same specimen collections that had been tested previously. Stakeholder input included the call for abstracts for the 2012 HIV Diagnostics Conference and oral comments from attendees at the December 2012 HIV Diagnostics Conference, and manuscripts from conference presentations were submitted for peer review and published in the December 2013 supplement to the Journal of Clinical Virology; additional oral comments were solicited at meetings of the CDC-HRSA Advisory Committee, American Association of Clinical Chemistry, Association of Medical Laboratory Immunologists, College of American Pathologists, and the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology, after which the writing group finalized the recommendations. The CDC/APHL working group members conducted a nonsystematic review of the literature, unpublished data, meeting abstracts and presentations, and manufacturers' package inserts.

HIV-1 Western blot versus HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation — parallel testing results from one prospective study show that among 993 specimens repeatedly reactive by 3rd or 4th generation immunoassays, 882 were reactive for HIV-1 only on the antibody differentiation assay, with HIV-1 Western blot positive in 871 and indeterminate in 11; six of the 11 indeterminate cases were eventually traced and found to have serologically confirmed HIV-1 infection. In the same study, 3 specimens were reactive for HIV-2 and 5 for both HIV-1 and HIV-2; the HIV-2–only and the strong dual-reactive specimens were positive by HIV-2 immunoblot and negative by HIV-1 NAT, the dually reactive specimen also had detectable HIV-2 RNA, and all 4 HIV-2 specimens showed 3 or 4 bands on the HIV-1 Western blot sufficient to classify 3 as HIV-1 positive and 1 as indeterminate.

### An HIV diagnostic testing algorithm using the cobas HIV-1 / HIV-2 qualitative assay for HIV type differentiation and confirmation [^112kDAx4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual test was also directly compared to alternative HIV-1 and HIV-2 NATs in specimens with known discordant serology results by the CDC algorithm (e.g. Ab/Ag positive and HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay negative or indeterminate). HIV-2 RNA reactivity was not observed on either assay for any serology-discordant specimen. For specimens with repeatedly reactive HIV Ag/Ab test results and negative or indeterminate Geenius assay results, the HIV-1 OPAs were 97.6% and 95.8%, respectively. Specimens such as these can indicate acute HIV infection and need to be confirmed by HIV-1 NAT and possibly another HIV-2 assay with the CDC algorithm. By including a NAT differentiation assay, the proposed alternative algorithm eliminates the need to resolve differentiation assay-negative or -indeterminate results while ensuring the ability to identify HIV-2 infection. However, this study was unable to determine the performance of the alternative algorithm in the setting of acute HIV infection, and future studies are needed.

---

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^113RFWgU]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV testing algorithm updates — differences from prior recommendations: Compared with previous testing recommendations, the updated algorithm increases sensitivity for acute HIV-1 infection by including an initial immunoassay that detects antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and also HIV-1 p24 antigen, and it identifies acute HIV-1 infection by using HIV-1 NAT for specimens that are reactive on the initial immunoassay but negative for antibodies on the second immunoassay. The previously recommended algorithms were predicated on screening for HIV-1 antibodies with specific testing for HIV-2 antibodies confined to only limited circumstances, whereas the updated algorithm screens for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies using a single supplemental antibody differentiation immunoassay. Because the recommended algorithm no longer relies on HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 IFA as a supplemental test, it yields fewer indeterminate results that require resolution by a follow-up test conducted several months later, and previously HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 IFA was recommended for all specimens after a reactive rapid HIV test result even if the initial laboratory immunoassay was nonreactive.

Caution must be exercised when fourth-generation HIV-1 immunoassays are interpreted in isolation, and additional testing should be considered depending on patient risk assessment.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^111Vnm1w]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV testing in pregnancy — false positives and confirmatory HIV RNA testing is outlined with study data and diagnostic steps: In a large urban hospital in Dallas, 21,163 women were screened using a combination antigen/antibody immunoassay, and of the 190 who tested positive, 28 were determined to have a false positive HIV test, yielding a positive predictive value of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77% to 88%) and a false positive rate of 0.16% (95% CI, 0.11% to 0.22%) using the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab assay. For women screened a second time in pregnancy, the rate of false positive results relative to true positive results may be higher over the 6 months between first- and third-trimester testing. For any positive HIV screen late in pregnancy, during labor, or immediately postpartum, an HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) assay should be done at the same time as the supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and the HIV RNA assay will be needed to resolve questions raised by discordant results between the antigen/antibody screen and the antibody differentiation assay. The combination of a positive HIV antigen/antibody screen with a negative supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and a negative HIV RNA assay is seen when there is a false positive antigen/antibody screen.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^111pPaQm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and RNA testing in pregnant individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — screening for chronic HCV infection using a sensitive immunoassay for HCV antibodies is recommended for all individuals with HIV, including during pregnancy, and in the United States, HCV screening should occur in each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. False-negative anti-HCV immunoassay results can occur in individuals with HIV, but this is uncommon with the more sensitive immunoassays. If HCV infection is suspected despite a negative HCV antibody screen, a commercially available diagnostic quantitative plasma HCV RNA assay can be performed, and individuals who have a positive HCV antibody test should undergo confirmatory testing with a quantitative plasma HCV RNA assay; many laboratories now perform reflex RNA testing for individuals who test positive for HCV antibodies. HCV RNA testing is recommended during pregnancy when serologic results for HCV are indeterminate or negative, but elevated aminotransaminase levels or risk behaviors, such as a history of injection drug use, suggest potential infection. At the initial prenatal visit, quantitative plasma HCV RNA testing and liver function assessments are recommended when HCV antibody positivity is confirmed to assess the risk of transmission of HCV to the infant and severity of liver disease. If considering HCV treatment during pregnancy, consultation with an expert in HIV and HCV is strongly recommended.

### False-positive human immunodeficiency virus-1 test results with rapid seroreversion after third-trimester tdap booster vaccination [^114mjrGd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

False-positive and false-negative results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing are expected at some frequency. False-positive results have been reported in association with various conditions, including pregnancy, autoimmune disease, and infection. We present an atypical case of a pregnant patient receiving false-positive HIV results for both screening and antibody confirmatory tests after a recent routine vaccination.

Case

A 34-year-old woman, G4P1021, with a negative first-trimester HIV test result received a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster at 35 2/7 weeks of gestation. Test results at 36 2/7 weeks of gestation were positive in both HIV-1/2 antigen-antibody screening and a confirmatory HIV-1 antibody differentiation immunoassay, but follow-up test results at 36 5/7 weeks and later were negative. Repeat testing and erythrocyte typing confirmed that this was not a result of laboratory error or specimen mishandling. HIV antiretroviral therapy was started and was later discontinued. A scheduled primary cesarean delivery performed at 39 1/7 weeks of gestation due to breech presentation was uncomplicated.

Conclusions

False-positive results in HIV screen and confirmation testing were associated with receipt of a Tdap vaccine booster 7 days prior. This test result pattern is similar to that seen very rarely in previous cases, and the rapid seroreversion to negative suggests an acute immunologic trigger leading to a falsely reactive antibody. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for false-positive HIV test results in patients who recently received vaccination or with other immune triggers and retest at a short interval if suspected.

HIV prevention related to pregnancy — clinical provider services for HIV-uninfected or unknown-status pregnant women with sex or drug-injection partners with HIV include: Include HIV testing early in pregnancy as part of routine prenatal screening panel; use opt-out approaches when allowed in the jurisdiction. Conduct repeat testing during the third trimester (using a test that detects recent HIV infection) for women whose earlier HIV test was negative. When a woman reports a possible, recent HIV exposure that might result in a new infection that would not be detected by antibody test alone (i.e., during the window period) or has signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection, use both an HIV antibody test and a plasma RNA test to enable diagnosis of acute HIV infection. For women who first present for pregnancy care during labor with unknown HIV status offer expedited HIV testing (using opt-out testing strategy when allowed by the jurisdiction) and provide information about perinatal HIV transmission, and IV zidovudine immediately if preliminary test result is positive to prevent perinatal transmission. For women who decline testing and whose HIV status remains unknown at delivery, take these steps: provide expedited antibody testing of the newborn as soon as possible after birth using consent procedures consistent with state laws and inform the woman that identifying HIV antibodies in the newborn would indicate maternal HIV infection. If the newborn HIV antibody test is positive, promptly inform the mother that the newborn needs virologic testing and immediate initiation of postnatal prophylaxis. Assess women with possible HIV exposure within the past 72 hours for indications for nPEP, and offer women with nPEP indications regimens that are suitable during pregnancy, based on HHS recommendations.

### Trends in HIV-2 diagnoses and use of the HIV-1 / HIV-2 differentiation test-United States, 2010–2017 [^113zKC7Q]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite increasing use of the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test, few HIV-2 infections are diagnosed in the United States. CDC continues to recommend that laboratories follow the laboratory-based algorithm with the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test as the second step. Use of an HIV-1 NAT in the algorithm would likely distinguish type of HIV infection for the majority of diagnoses in the United States. Follow-up testing of specimens that remain ambiguous regarding HIV type after testing with an HIV-1 NAT is also recommended. However, updates to the laboratory-based testing algorithm merit consideration in the United States. This could include development of new FDA-approved tests to reduce the time to HIV diagnosis and treatment, primarily for HIV-1, but in rare cases, for HIV-2.

### An HIV diagnostic testing algorithm using the cobas HIV-1 / HIV-2 qualitative assay for HIV type differentiation and confirmation [^1154SVoX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

It is unclear whether sample handling or other sample collection issues are another possible cause for the serology-positive, NAT-nonreactive results or if pregnancy is an independent predictor of serology-positive, HIV RNA-negative results. Although specimens with discordant results were not diluted, plasma and serum specimens used in this study were collected from 2007 to 2019 and were presumed to have been stored frozen at −20°C or below until the time of testing. However, suboptimal sample handling and storage conditions for even short periods may have compromised the specimen integrity, resulting in a degradation of RNA. The clinical performance of the proposed alternative algorithm in individuals at high risk of HIV infection may not be reflected in this study due to limitations in the study methodology, which required testing samples after prolonged storage. Notably, all 21 specimens with discordant results were from the subset of pregnant women (n = 236) tested from the HIV-1 high-risk group (n = 1,021). This observation warrants further investigation since a false-positive Geenius result was previously reported for a pregnant woman, and these results may also represent false-positive HIV-1 serology results. Future evaluations of the proposed alternative algorithm using prospectively collected specimens are warranted to assess the clinical performance of cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual and to understand the effects of pregnancy, acute infection, ART, and PrEP on the performance of an algorithm using an HIV NAT as the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay. Evaluating the use of cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual to distinguish infection from vaccine-induced seropositivity/reactivity in contemporary HIV-1 vaccine trials can also be considered.

The testing costs and workflow differences associated with the implementation of the proposed alternative algorithm also need to be further explored, taking into account reductions of Geenius-indeterminate results following a recent software upgrade, the ability of diagnostic algorithms incorporating the Architect signal-to-cutoff ratio to facilitate acute HIV diagnosis, and the fully automated workflow with the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 Qual test. If our results can be generalized across laboratories, there may be appreciable gains in testing efficiency achieved by using a highly automated HIV-1/HIV-2 NAT as the differentiation assay. Two recent studies have suggested that using HIV-1 NAT after the initial HIV Ag/Ab immunoassay, rather than Geenius, can more accurately identify both acute and established infections and reduce the overall number of tests required for diagnosis. An HIV-1/HIV-2 NAT may provide the additional advantage of HIV-2 diagnosis.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^113Kyzao]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Discordant or false positive HIV test results — interpretation and actions during pregnancy include that early in HIV infection, before HIV seroconversion, the combination of a positive antigen/antibody screen, negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and positive HIV RNA assay may be seen, because the immunoglobulin G–based antibody differentiation assay is positive later in infection than the antigen capture or the immunoglobulin M result in the antigen/antibody screen. In a large urban hospital in Dallas, 21,163 women were screened using a combination antigen/antibody immunoassay; of the 190 who tested positive, 28 were determined to have a false positive HIV test, yielding a positive predictive value of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77% to 88%) and a false positive rate of 0.16% (95% CI, 0.11% to 0.22%), using the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab assay. For any positive HIV screen late in pregnancy, during labor, or immediately postpartum, an HIV RNA assay should be done at the same time as the supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and the combination of a positive HIV antigen/antibody screen with a negative supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and a negative HIV RNA assay is seen when there is a false positive antigen/antibody screen. For women screened a second time in pregnancy, the rate of false positive results relative to true positive results may be higher.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1147V61z]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of HIV in infants and children — HIV can be diagnosed definitively by virologic testing in most non-breastfed infants with perinatal HIV exposure by age 1 to 2 months and in all by age 4 to 6 months, and because HIV antibodies transferred transplacentally may be detected (i.e., false positive), a virologic test must be used. Positive virologic tests (nucleic acid tests [NATs]) indicate likely HIV infection, and plasma HIV RNA and HIV DNA NATs are generally equally recommended; however, both tests can be affected by antiretroviral therapy and qualitative HIV proviral DNA PCR assays from whole blood detecting cell-associated virus are less affected by ARVs. A positive HIV test result should be confirmed as soon as possible by repeat virologic testing. Newer HIV RNA PCR assays are usually dual-target assays that target two separate highly conserved regions on the HIV genome, and dual-target assays are better than older RNA assays at detecting non–subtype B HIV infection and Group O strains. Antigen/antibody combination immunoassays are not recommended for diagnosis in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure; in the first months of life, antibody tests should not be used for HIV diagnosis in infants and children aged < 18 months, and for those aged ≥ 18 months who remain HIV antibody–positive, definitive confirmation should be based on a NAT.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1161z9Un]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic testing — limitations of the evidence supporting these recommendations include that evaluations of test performance were based on comparison with a composite standard consisting of a positive HIV-1 Western blot, the presence of HIV-1 RNA, or both, and clinical evidence from follow-up evaluations was rarely available to document true HIV status; therefore some false-positive test results might have gone undetected. Only two HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassays, one HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, and one HIV-1 NAT were approved by the FDA for HIV diagnosis as of December 2012, and all performance evaluations were conducted with these assays, with additional evaluations required as new assays are introduced. Published studies document indeterminate results on the FDA-approved HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay in 0.8% to 1.4% of specimens with reactivity, and 11% to 15% of indeterminate specimens proved to be HIV-negative; no published follow-up data are available to definitively determine whether indeterminate results with detectable HIV-1 RNA represent an evolving antibody response or whether such results might persist during established infection. For HIV-2, little evidence exists for the timing of antibody development or the occurrence of acute HIV-2 infection in the United States, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved; 4th generation antigen/antibody combination assays detect IgM and IgG against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 as well as p24 antigen specific for HIV-1 but not p26/27, and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay detects only IgG against HIV-1 and HIV-2.

### An HIV diagnostic testing algorithm using the cobas HIV-1 / HIV-2 qualitative assay for HIV type differentiation and confirmation [^114Hgnmx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) diagnostic testing algorithms recommended by the Centers for Disease Control involve up to three tests and rely mostly on detection of viral antigen and host antibody responses. HIV-1 p24 antigen/HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody-reactive specimens are confirmed with an immunochromatographic HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and negative or indeterminate results from the differentiation assay are resolved by an HIV-1-specific nucleic acid amplification test (NAT). The performance of a proposed alternative algorithm using the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative NAT as the differentiation assay was evaluated in subjects known to be infected with HIV-1 (n = 876) or HIV-2 (n = 139), at low (n = 6,017) or high (n = 1,020) risk of HIV-1 infection, or at high-risk for HIV-2 infection (n = 498) (study A). The performance of the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative test was also evaluated by comparison to an HIV-1 or HIV-2 alternative NAT (study B). The HIV-1 and HIV-2 overall percent agreements (OPA) in study A ranged from 95% to 100% in all groups. The positive percent agreements (PPA) for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were 100% (876/876) and 99.4% (167/168), respectively, for known positive groups. The negative percent agreement in the HIV low-risk group was 100% for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. In study B, the HIV-1 and HIV-2 OPA ranged from 99% to 100% in all groups evaluated (n = 183 to 1,030), and the PPA for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were 100% and 99.5%, respectively, for known positive groups. The cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative assay can discriminate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 based on HIV RNA and can be included in an alternative diagnostic algorithm for HIV.

HIV-1 NAT alternative testing pathways outline specific steps and limitations. Use of HIV-1 NAT as the second test instead of an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is specified: If HIV-1 NAT result is negative, perform an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay or other FDA-approved HIV-1 supplemental antibody test, and if result of an HIV-1 supplemental antibody test is nonreactive or indeterminate, perform an HIV-2 antibody test. Another option is use of HIV-1 NAT (or pooled HIV-1 NAT) after a nonreactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassay; a reactive NAT result provides evidence of acute HIV-1 infection, but false-positive results occur, and follow-up testing to document seroconversion should be conducted if a laboratory HIV diagnosis is based on the result of HIV-1 NAT only. Stated limitations include that this alternative fails to distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from established HIV-1 infection, increases turnaround time for test results and incurs additional costs, and that no HIV-1 NAT is FDA-approved for pooled testing for HIV diagnosis and individual or pooled HIV-1 NAT can detect acute infections not detected by a 4th generation immunoassay, but occasionally produces a false-positive result, requires more tests on each specimen, increases turnaround time for test results, and is more costly than the recommended algorithm.

ABSTRACT

Human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) diagnostic testing algorithms recommended by the Centers for Disease Control involve up to three tests and rely mostly on detection of viral antigen and host antibody responses. HIV-1 p24 antigen/HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody-reactive specimens are confirmed with an immunochromatographic HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and negative or indeterminate results from the differentiation assay are resolved by an HIV-1-specific nucleic acid amplification test (NAT). The performance of a proposed alternative algorithm using the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative NAT as the differentiation assay was evaluated in subjects known to be infected with HIV-1 (n = 876) or HIV-2 (n = 139), at low (n = 6,017) or high (n = 1,020) risk of HIV-1 infection, or at high-risk for HIV-2 infection (n = 498) (study A). The performance of the cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative test was also evaluated by comparison to an HIV-1 or HIV-2 alternative NAT (study B). The HIV-1 and HIV-2 overall percent agreements (OPA) in study A ranged from 95% to 100% in all groups. The positive percent agreements (PPA) for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were 100% (876/876) and 99.4% (167/168), respectively, for known positive groups. The negative percent agreement in the HIV low-risk group was 100% for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. In study B, the HIV-1 and HIV-2 OPA ranged from 99% to 100% in all groups evaluated (n = 183 to 1,030), and the PPA for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were 100% and 99.5%, respectively, for known positive groups. The cobas HIV-1/HIV-2 qualitative assay can discriminate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 based on HIV RNA and can be included in an alternative diagnostic algorithm for HIV.

Acute HIV infection in pregnancy, intrapartum, or breastfeeding — Clinicians should assess risk of acute HIV infection during pregnancy due to the window period, as the antigen/antibody immunoassay may detect infection as early as 18 days after infection, antibody-only assays may not detect infection until as long as 45 days post-infection, and the HIV RNA assay can detect the presence of HIV as early as 10 days post-infection; when acute HIV infection is suspected during pregnancy, during the intrapartum period, or while breastfeeding, a plasma HIV RNA assay should be performed in conjunction with an antigen/antibody immunoassay.

Based on expert opinion, low HIV-2 prevalence, and the lack of an FDA-approved NAT for HIV-2, laboratories should report dually reactive test results as positive for HIV antibodies that could not be differentiated as HIV-1 or HIV-2, and recommend further investigation for HIV-2 if clinically indicated (for example, if HIV-1 RNA is undetectable on the viral load assay conducted as part of the initial medical workup).

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the first prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, preferably at < 36 weeks' gestation, should be considered and is recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring HIV, women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV infection, and women served in clinical settings in which prenatal screening identifies ≥ 1 pregnant woman with HIV per 1,000 women screened. Diagnostic algorithms for HIV for pregnant women do not differ from those for nonpregnant women (see STI Detection Among Special Populations). Pregnant women should be informed that HIV testing will be performed as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests; for women who decline HIV testing, providers should address concerns that pose obstacles, discuss the benefits of testing (e.g. early HIV detection, treatment, and care for improving health of the mother and reducing perinatal transmission of HIV), and encourage testing at subsequent prenatal visits. Women who decline testing because they have had a previous negative HIV test result should be informed about the importance of retesting during each pregnancy. Women with no prenatal care should be tested for HIV at the time of delivery.

Testing pregnant women is crucial because knowledge of infection status can help maintain the woman's health, and it enables receipt of interventions (i.e. ART or specialized obstetrical care) that can substantially reduce the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV. Pregnant women with diagnosed HIV infection should be educated about the benefits of ART for their own health and for reducing the risk for HIV transmission to their infant. In the absence of ART, a mother's risk for transmitting HIV to her neonate is approximately 30%; however, risk can be reduced to < 2% through ART, obstetrical interventions (i.e. elective cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' pregnancy), and breastfeeding avoidance. Pregnant women with HIV infection should be linked to an HIV care provider experienced in managing HIV in pregnancy and provided antenatal and postpartum treatment and advice. Detailed and regularly updated recommendations for managing pregnant patients with HIV infection are available at.

HIV Infection Among Neonates, Infants, and Children

Diagnosis of HIV infection in a pregnant woman indicates the need for evaluating and managing the HIV-exposed neonate and considering whether the woman's other children, if any, might be infected. Detailed recommendations regarding diagnosis and management of HIV infection among neonates and children of mothers with HIV are beyond the scope of these guidelines but are available at. Exposed neonates and children with HIV infection should be referred to physicians with expertise in neonatal and pediatric HIV management.

Currently available assays for early infant diagnosis

In adults and older children, chronic HIV-1 infection can be diagnosed accurately by detection of serum antibodies against HIV-1. However, in infants born to HIV-infected women, maternal anti-HIV antibodies cross the placenta and persist in infant blood for up to 18 months (Figure 2). When detected in young infants, these antibodies usually represent exposure to maternal HIV rather than true infant HIV infection. Antibody-based tests can therefore be accurately used only to exclude infant infection after 12 months of age, or to confirm infant infection after 15–18 months of age.

Figure 2
HIV RNA levels and anti-HIV antibody responses among HIV-exposed infants with and without HIV infection. Schematic depiction of the timing of positive HIV-1 antibody testing and RNA levels among HIV-exposed infants. The horizontal axis shows infant age in months. The left vertical axis shows mean HIV-1 RNA level on a logarithmic scale, and corresponds to the green lines on each graph. The right vertical axis shows the proportion of infants for whom an HIV antibody test would likely return positive, and corresponds to the red lines on each graph. The proportion of infants with a positive antibody test in all panels is approximate, based on a wide range of reported ages at which transmitted maternal HIV antibody fades from detection in the sera of uninfected infants. Similarly, the mean RNA level is also approximate, based on several studies of infected infants with and without receipt of antiretroviral drugs for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). (a) Results for an HIV-exposed infant who is born without HIV infection and remains uninfected throughout breastfeeding. In this case, HIV-RNA level remains zero, and maternal HIV antibody fades with time. (b) Results for infants infected before birth, either during the intrauterine period (IU; resulting in a high RNA level immediately after birth) or during the intrapartum period (IP; resulting in a 1–2 week delay before viremia is detectable). Maternal HIV antibody is present at birth; although maternal antibody fades with time, endogenous infant antibody production begins in response to infant infection. (c) Results for an HIV-exposed infant who is uninfected at birth, but becomes infected at approximately 6 months of age through breastfeeding. HIV RNA is undetectable while the infant is uninfected, but rises rapidly within the first few weeks after infection. Maternal antibody is present at birth and begins to fade with time, but infant antibody production begins after infant infection occurs.

HIV antibody testing algorithm — background explains that accurate laboratory diagnosis relies on testing algorithms that maximize overall sensitivity and specificity by employing a sequence of tests in combination and applying decision rules for resolving discordant test results; since 1989 in the United States, the CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) recommended initiating testing with a sensitive HIV-1 antibody immunoassay, with specimens that are repeatedly reactive then tested with a more specific HIV-1 antibody test, either the HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), to validate those results, and in 1992 CDC recommended specific testing for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies if demographic or behavioral information suggested that HIV-2 infection might be present.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^111ZwbNE]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-2 infection — epidemiology and testing implications: Fewer than 200 cases of HIV-2 in the United States had been reported to CDC through 2009, although criteria for an HIV-2 case definition were not specified until 2014; the majority of U.S. HIV-2 diagnoses have been in persons born in Africa, especially West Africa, but 12% of HIV-2 diagnoses were made in persons whose birthplace was India, North America or Europe. It is theoretically possible that acute HIV-2 infection might produce a repeatedly reactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result with nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) results, and based on expert opinion and the low prevalence of HIV-2 infection in the United States, this sequence most likely indicates a false-positive initial immunoassay result; laboratories should report that such test results indicate no laboratory evidence for HIV-1 infection and suggest follow-up testing for HIV-2 if clinically indicated. Although accurate diagnosis of HIV-2 is clinically important because HIV-2 strains are naturally resistant to several antiretroviral drugs developed to suppress HIV-1, diagnosis of HIV-2 can be problematic; only two reports of acute HIV-2 infections have been published, the reliability of HIV-2 NAT during acute HIV-2 infection is unknown, and in specimens obtained 5 to 6 months after seroconversion, plasma HIV-2 viral load was 28 times lower in HIV-2 seroconverters than among comparable HIV-1 seroconverters.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fourth-generation ARCHITECT HIV Ag / Ab combo assay and utility of signal-to-cutoff ratio to predict false-positive HIV tests in pregnancy [^116ZN7LG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

False-positive HIV screening tests in pregnancy may lead to unnecessary interventions in labor. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new algorithm for HIV diagnosis using a fourth-generation screening test, which detects antibodies to HIV as well as p24 antigen and has a shorter window period compared with prior generations. A reactive screen requires a differentiation assay, and supplemental qualitative RNA testing is necessary for nonreactive differentiation assay. One screening test, the ARCHITECT Ag/Ab Combo assay, is described to have 100% sensitivity and > 99% specificity in nonpregnant populations; however, its clinical performance in pregnancy has not been well described.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the performance of the ARCHITECT assay among pregnant women at a large county hospital and to assess whether the relative signal-to-cutoff ratio can be used to differentiate between false-positive vs confirmed HIV infections in women with a nonreactive differentiation assay.

Study Design

This is a retrospective review of fourth-generation HIV testing in pregnant women at Parkland Hospital between June 1, 2015, and Jan. 31, 2017. We identified gravidas screened using the ARCHITECT Ag/Ab Combo assay (index test), with reflex to differentiation assay. Women with reactive ARCHITECT and nonreactive differentiation assay were evaluated with a qualitative RNA assay (reference standard). We calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and false-positive rate of the ARCHITECT screening assay in our population and described characteristics of women with false-positive HIV testing vs confirmed infection. Among women with a nonreactive differentiation assay, we compared interventions among women with and without a qualitative RNA assay result available at delivery and examined relative signal-to-cutoff ratios of the ARCHITECT assay in women with false-positive vs confirmed HIV infection.

Results

A total of 21,163 pregnant women were screened using the ARCHITECT assay, and 190 tested positive. Of these, 33 of 190 (17%) women had false-positive HIV screening tests (28 deliveries available for analysis), and 157 of 190 (83%) had confirmed HIV-1 infection (140 available for analysis). Diagnostic accuracy of the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay in our prenatal population (with 95% confidence interval) was as follows: sensitivity, 100% (97.7–100%); specificity, 99.8% (99.8–99.9%); positive likelihood ratio, 636 (453–895); negative likelihood ratio, 0.0 (NA); positive predictive value, 83% (77–88%); and false positive rate, 0.16% (0.11–0.22%), with a prevalence of 7 per 1000. Women with false-positive HIV testing were younger and more likely of Hispanic ethnicity. A qualitative RNA assay (reference standard) was performed prenatally in 24 (86%) and quantitative viral load in 22 (92%). Interventions occurred more frequently in women without a qualitative RNA assay result available at delivery, including intrapartum zidovudine (75% vs 4%, P = .002), breastfeeding delay (75% vs 8%, P = .001), and neonatal zidovudine initiation (75% vs 4%, P = .002). The ARCHITECT signal-to-cutoff ratio was significantly lower for women with false-positive HIV tests compared with those with established HIV infection (1.89 [1.27, 2.73] vs 533.65 [391.12, 737.22], respectively, P < .001).

Conclusion

While the performance of the fourth-generation ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay among pregnant women is comparable with that reported in nonpregnant populations, clinical implications of using a screening test with a positive predictive value of 83% in pregnancy are significant. When the qualitative RNA assay result is unavailable, absence of risk factors in combination with an ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab assay S/Co ratio < 5 and nonreactive differentiation assay provide sufficient evidence to support deferral of unnecessary intrapartum interventions while awaiting qualitative RNA results.

### A case of false-positive test results in a pregnant woman of unknown HIV status at delivery [^116LCkEX]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We report a case of a false-positive HIV result in an apparently healthy pregnant woman. Since no prenatal HIV testing had been performed, we screened for HIV reactivity utilizing the Architect HIV-Ag/Ab Combo assay. Results obtained were inconsistent in that they were repeatedly HIV reactive on a single serum sample while nonreactive on a plasma sample. However, both sample types were nonreactive on the Advia Centaur HIV-1/O/2 and Oraquick assays. For further confirmation, an HIV-1 Western blot and viral load were performed; blot results were indeterminate while the viral load was undetectable. We concluded that the repeatedly reactive serum serology results were false-positive. While the cause of this false reactivity is not clear, most likely fibrin microclots in the serum sample interfered with the assay and thus accounted for the false positivity. Plasma may thus provide a more appropriate sample type when using the Architect assay, especially when testing pregnant women.

Acute and recent HIV infection — diagnostic testing and confirmation: Acute HIV infection is defined as detectable HIV RNA or p24 antigen in the setting of a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result, and a reactive HIV antibody or Ag/Ab combination test result must be followed by supplemental confirmatory testing. A negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result in a person with a reactive Ag/Ab test result or in whom acute HIV infection is suspected requires plasma HIV RNA testing to diagnose acute HIV infection, and a positive result on a quantitative or qualitative plasma HIV RNA test with a negative or indeterminate antibody test result indicates that acute HIV infection is highly likely and should be confirmed by subsequent documentation of HIV antibody seroconversion. For people taking PrEP, a positive HIV Ag/Ab or HIV RNA test result with a negative HIV antibody test result should prompt immediate confirmation of HIV diagnosis, and it is important to collect a new blood specimen to verify the HIV diagnosis before initiating HIV treatment.

Infant HIV nucleic acid testing (NAT) for suspected non–subtype B or Group O exposure — A qualitative RNA assay, a quantitative RNA assay, or a total DNA/RNA (total nucleic acid) test should be used in addition to a DNA PCR assay when evaluating an infant exposed to areas endemic for non–subtype B HIV or Group O strains; these additional tests are also indicated when initial HIV DNA PCR testing is negative and non–subtype B or Group O perinatal exposure is suspected. Two negative HIV antibody test results obtained at age ≥ 6 months provide further evidence to rule out HIV infection definitively, and clinicians should consult with an expert in pediatric HIV infection. Current HIV RNA PCR assays and qualitative diagnostic RNA assays are better at detecting non–subtype B HIV infection and the less-common Group O strains than older RNA assays, the increased sensitivity is due to amplification of more than one highly conserved region of the HIV genome, and HIV DNA assays, though generally less sensitive, may be more sensitive when the infant is receiving ART because identification is based on detection of cell-associated DNA and does not rely on active viral replication.

Perinatal HIV testing algorithm — initial, supplemental, and RNA steps: The Panels recommend that clinicians initiate HIV testing with an immunoassay that can detect HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Individuals with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay should be tested further with an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay. Individuals with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay and a nonreactive differentiation test should be tested with an FDA-approved plasma HIV RNA assay to assess for acute HIV infection. In some clinical settings where initial testing uses a rapid HIV test, positive results on POC rapid tests should be followed first by a laboratory-based antigen/antibody assay using serum or plasma and, when reactive, followed by a differentiation assay.
