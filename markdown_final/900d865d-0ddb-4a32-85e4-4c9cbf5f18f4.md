## Question

Can we wean patient off metoprolol if he has a watchman device that controls his Atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if metoprolol can be weaned in a patient with a Watchman device that is thought to "control his atrial fibrillation". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinct roles of a left atrial appendage occluder versus a beta-blocker. Then, I should verify current AF guideline recommendations for rate control irrespective of stroke-prevention strategy. Next, I will review heart rate targets and heart failure considerations that influence beta-blocker use. Finally, I should synthesize when, if ever, weaning metoprolol is reasonable and how to do it safely, independent of the Watchman device status [^1111A18w] [^1112fr7X].

> Let me first confirm the device's purpose, because I don't want to conflate mechanisms. The Watchman (LAAC) prevents thromboembolism by occluding the left atrial appendage; it does not treat atrial fibrillation itself, does not reduce AF burden, and does not control ventricular rate or restore sinus rhythm, so it cannot replace a rate-control agent like metoprolol, which acts on the AV node to slow conduction and limit ventricular response during AF [^1112fr7X] [^111q83uK] [^116jFvpo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping metoprolol; I should verify guideline-directed therapy for AF rate control. Contemporary ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guidance recommends beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as first-line agents for acute and chronic rate control based on comorbidities and left ventricular ejection fraction, and this recommendation is independent of the patient's stroke-prevention strategy or LAAC status, which means LAAC does not alter the indication for rate control therapy if AF persists or recurs [^1111A18w] [^111Sdrky] [^116gaw1M] [^116zC4Vj].

> Wait, let me verify appropriate heart rate targets because that affects the need for ongoing rate control. In stable AF without heart failure, a symptom-guided goal of resting HR < 100–110 bpm is reasonable (lenient control), whereas in suspected AF-mediated cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms, a stricter target of resting HR < 80 bpm and < 110 bpm with moderate exertion is advised; either way, these targets necessitate continuing some form of rate-control agent if AF is ongoing or paroxysmal with episodes of rapid ventricular response [^113b9KYs] [^113TVsoi] [^1177LmhS].

> I need to check heart failure status because that changes the agent choice and strengthens the rationale to continue beta-blockade. In LVEF ≤ 40%, beta-blockers are preferred for rate control and NDHP calcium channel blockers should be avoided, acknowledging that while beta-blockers do not clearly reduce mortality in HFrEF patients who are in AF, they remain essential for rate control and are foundational therapy for HFrEF overall; in LVEF > 40%, either beta-blockers or NDHP CCBs are appropriate, individualized to symptoms and comorbidities such as COPD, where cardioselective beta-blockers can still be used when indicated [^113RkMLE] [^111Zw67U] [^113NwaUu] [^114s8oCk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied the device status might inform rate-control discontinuation, but that would be misleading; I should double-check for any guidance suggesting rate-control therapy can be stopped after LAAC. I do not find recommendations to discontinue beta-blockers simply because a Watchman was implanted; LAAC guidance addresses stroke prevention and periprocedural antithrombotic strategies, not ventricular rate management, so the decision to continue or wean metoprolol should be driven by heart rate control, AF burden, symptoms, LV function, and comorbid conditions, not by the presence of a Watchman [^1111A18w] [^1112fr7X].

> Next, I should review practical clinical triggers for considering a metoprolol taper, and I need to ensure these are Watchman-agnostic. Reasonable considerations include documented stable sinus rhythm without paroxysmal AF episodes, persistent bradycardia or hypotension attributable to beta-blockade, fatigue or other intolerable adverse effects, and absence of other indications such as HFrEF, CAD, or hypertension; conversely, ongoing or intermittent AF with rapid ventricular responses, reduced EF, or ischemia risk argues against tapering and supports continuation of rate control per guideline targets [^1111A18w] [^113b9KYs] [^116gaw1M].

> I will now examine how to taper safely if the clinical review truly supports it, and I should confirm monitoring steps. A gradual dose reduction over 1–2 weeks with close surveillance of resting and ambulatory heart rates, symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness), and blood pressure is prudent, with a low threshold to pause or reverse the taper if resting HR rises above the agreed target or symptomatic AF recurs; this aligns with the general principle that rate control should be adjusted to meet symptom-guided HR targets in AF rather than to device status [^113b9KYs] [^1111A18w].

> But wait, what if the underlying assumption is that the Watchman "controls AF"? I should clarify that misconception explicitly so the recommendation is unambiguous. The Watchman addresses thromboembolic risk from the LAA and has no effect on AV nodal conduction or atrial substrate; therefore, it should not be used as a rationale to stop metoprolol when AF rate control is still clinically indicated by heart rate targets, symptoms, or comorbid conditions, and no guideline endorses weaning rate-control therapy solely due to LAAC [^1112fr7X] [^1111A18w].

> Bottom line after cross-checking: No, the presence of a Watchman device is not in itself an indication to wean off metoprolol; continue or adjust metoprolol based on AF rate-control needs, symptom burden, LV function, and comorbidities, using lenient or strict HR targets as appropriate, and only consider a cautious taper if there is no ongoing indication and the patient remains within target heart rates without symptomatic AF, independent of LAAC status [^1111A18w] [^113b9KYs] [^1177LmhS] [^1112fr7X].

---

No, the Watchman device **does not control atrial fibrillation or its ventricular rate** [^1111A18w]; it only **reduces stroke risk** by occluding the left atrial appendage [^1112fr7X] [^1132Vy9b]. Metoprolol or another rate-control agent **is still needed** to prevent tachycardia, symptoms, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS]. Metoprolol can be weaned only if the patient is in stable sinus rhythm or has adequate rate control on an alternative agent, with close monitoring for rapid AF recurrence [^113b9KYs]. The Watchman device **does not replace the need for rate control therapy** [^111q83uK].

---

## Role of the watchman device in atrial fibrillation management

The Watchman device is a percutaneously implanted left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device designed to **reduce the risk of thromboembolic stroke** in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who have contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation therapy [^1112fr7X]. The device works by occluding the left atrial appendage, thereby preventing thrombus formation and subsequent embolization [^113MmFW3]. However, the Watchman device **does not address the underlying arrhythmia or its hemodynamic consequences**. Its primary function is **stroke prevention**, **not rhythm or rate control** [^116jFvpo] [^111q83uK].

---

## Role of metoprolol in atrial fibrillation management

Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly prescribed for **rate control** in patients with AF [^1111A18w]. It works by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, thereby reducing ventricular rate and preventing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS]. Metoprolol is particularly beneficial in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure, or other cardiovascular comorbidities [^116gaw1M].

---

## Clinical guidelines regarding beta-blocker therapy in AF patients with watchman devices

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized patient assessment** when considering beta-blocker discontinuation in patients with AF and Watchman devices [^1111A18w]. The decision to wean a patient off metoprolol should be based on several factors, including:

- **Presence of sinus rhythm**: If the patient has achieved and maintained sinus rhythm, discontinuation of metoprolol may be considered [^111noMow].

- **Adequate rate control**: If the patient remains in AF but has adequate rate control (resting heart rate < 100–110 bpm) [^113b9KYs] without significant symptoms, discontinuation may be considered.

- **Alternative rate control agents**: If the patient cannot tolerate metoprolol due to side effects or contraindications, alternative rate control agents such as nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) may be considered [^1111A18w] [^113RkMLE].

## Risks and benefits of discontinuing metoprolol in AF patients with watchman devices

### Benefits

Potential benefits of discontinuing metoprolol include **reduced side effects** — such as fatigue, bradycardia, hypotension, and sexual dysfunction — and **improved quality of life** in patients with significant adverse effects [^112WUjJ8] [^113H9m2z].

---

### Risks

Discontinuing metoprolol may lead to **recurrence of rapid atrial fibrillation** with palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue [^1111A18w]. Uncontrolled rapid AF may precipitate **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**, a potentially reversible form of heart failure [^1177LmhS]. Patients may experience increased symptom burden and reduced functional capacity if AF recurs or becomes uncontrolled [^113TVsoi].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting discontinuation of metoprolol in AF patients with watchman devices

There is **limited clinical evidence** specifically on discontinuing metoprolol in patients with AF and Watchman devices. Nonetheless, general AF management principles allow consideration of beta-blocker discontinuation in patients who have achieved and maintained sinus rhythm or have adequate rate control without significant symptoms [^113TVsoi]. Additionally, an American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) study emphasizes the importance of **individualized patient assessment** and shared decision-making when considering discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy in AF patients [^1111A18w].

---

## Alternative medications and strategies for rate control in AF patients with watchman devices

If metoprolol is discontinued, alternative medications and strategies for rate control include:

- **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**: Diltiazem or verapamil may be considered for rate control in patients without significant left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF > 40%) [^1111A18w] [^111Sdrky].

- **Digoxin**: May be considered in patients with heart failure or those who cannot tolerate beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers [^1111A18w].

- **Catheter ablation**: May be considered in patients with symptomatic AF refractory to medical therapy [^111noMow].

- **AV nodal ablation with pacemaker implantation**: May be considered in patients with refractory AF and uncontrolled ventricular rates despite maximal medical therapy [^114pjgxy] [^111CW5aX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up protocols after discontinuing metoprolol

If metoprolol is discontinued, careful monitoring and follow-up are essential to detect rapid AF recurrence or other complications. Recommended monitoring protocols include:

- **Regular ECG monitoring**: Regular ECGs or Holter monitoring to detect recurrence of rapid AF [^11248Jrm].

- **Symptom assessment**: Regular assessment of symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath [^1111A18w].

- **Echocardiography**: Periodic echocardiography to assess left ventricular function and detect tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS].

- **Patient education**: Educating patients about symptoms of rapid AF recurrence and when to seek medical attention [^1111A18w].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, the Watchman device **does not control atrial fibrillation** or its ventricular rate [^1111A18w]; it only reduces the risk of stroke by occluding the left atrial appendage [^1112fr7X]. Metoprolol or another rate-control agent **is still needed** to prevent tachycardia, symptoms, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS]. Metoprolol can be weaned only if the patient is in stable sinus rhythm or has adequate rate control on an alternative agent, with close monitoring for recurrence of rapid AF [^113b9KYs]. The Watchman device does not replace the need for rate control therapy [^1132Vy9b].

### Left atrial appendage closure for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and perspectives [^111q83uK]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Catheter-based left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) versus oral anticoagulation (OAC) with vitamin K antagonists has been studied extensively. Two prominent studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of LAAC with the first-generation Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) compared to OAC with warfarin.

The randomized controlled PROTECT-AF trial (NCT00129545) fulfilled the primary efficacy endpoint but failed the primary safety endpoint due to an excess of peri-procedural adverse events. Concerns regarding peri-procedural complications, patient risk factors, poor adherence to mandated anticoagulation, and potential confounding by antiplatelet therapy led to the requirement of a second study by the FDA.

The subsequent PREVAIL trial (NCT01182441) did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint due to low event rates but did meet late efficacy and safety criteria. Notably, there was a signal of increased ischemic strokes in the LAAC group within the PREVAIL trial, which became more pronounced at later follow-ups. A patient-level meta-analysis of both studies over five years revealed non-inferiority for the combined primary efficacy endpoint, encompassing stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death. Stroke and systemic embolism rates were comparable in both treatment groups (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60–1.54; P = 0.87).

Interestingly, a reduction in fatal and severe stroke post-LAAC was observed (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21–0.94; P = 0.034), though based on small event numbers. Cardiovascular (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.49; P = 0.027) and overall mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; P = 0.035) were lower following catheter-based LAAC.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rate control and long-term control, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as diltiazem and verapamil. The choice of agent should be based on the underlying substrate and comorbid conditions in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Indications for left atrial appendage occlusion in the United States and associated in-hospital outcomes: Results from the NCDR LAAO registry [^1132Vy9b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration approved left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device for patients who are at increased stroke risk and are suitable for oral anticoagulation but who have an appropriate reason to seek a nondrug alternative. These broad criteria raise the question of their interpretation in clinical practice. There is a lack of studies comprehensively evaluating the indications for Watchman implantation among a large series of patients from contemporary, real-world practice in the United States.

- **Methods**: We used the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry to identify Watchman procedures performed between 2016 and 2018. We assessed procedural indications for Watchman implantation in the United States and evaluated the association between procedural indications and in-hospital adverse events.

- **Results**: A total of 38,314 procedures were included. The mean patient age was 76.1 ± 8.1 years, and 58.9% were men. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.8 ± 1.5, whereas the mean hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol (HAS-BLED) score was 3.0 ± 1.1. Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack was reported in 40.2%, and prior bleeding in 70.1%, with gastrointestinal bleeding being most common (41.9%). The most common site-reported procedural indications for Watchman implantation were increased thromboembolic risk (64.8%) and history of major bleed (64.3%), followed by high fall risk (35.5%). Most (71.9%) had an indication for the procedure.

Our implantation success rate (96.2%) is comparable to previous studies (Figure 4). Our 7-day procedure/device-related complication rate was 4.3%, lower than PROTECT-AF (8.7%) and compared favorably to the subsequent WATCHMAN studies (Figure 5). In our study, 38% of patients had same-day discharge (SDD) and 62% had non-SDD. The trend of SDD, comparing the first year and final year of the study, increased significantly from 0% to 53.3%, reflecting our center/operator experience in postprocedural care and improved comfort level for SDD.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^116jXM56]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning patients with valvular heart disease, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating long-term anticoagulation with warfarin over DOACs. This recommendation aims to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke or death, in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) or MS of moderate or greater severity and a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), independent of the CHA2DS2-VASc score.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, acute control, and choice of agents, the ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV amiodarone for acute rate control in patients with AF with rapid ventricular response who are critically ill and/or have decompensated heart failure. This recommendation applies when β-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated.

### The assessment of the Watchman device in patients unsuitable for oral anticoagulation (ASAP-TOO) trial [^112q1wHX]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); however, they are underused due to absolute or relative contraindications stemming from real or perceived risks of bleeding. Although left atrial appendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, this approach has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial.

- **Study objectives**: The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety endpoint includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention.

- **Study design**: This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2 and who are deemed by two study physicians to be unsuitable for OAC will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy at the discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigational sites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months, and then every 6 months through 60 months.

This trial aims to assess the safety and efficacy of the Watchman device in the specified patient population.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: What should we do [^116BGjuQ]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

β-Blockers are now a standardized part of treatment in HFrEF following numerous RCTs that describe a substantial reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization compared with placebo. In these trials, between 8 and 23% of enrolled participants were in AF at baseline. Pooling individual patient data from 11 RCTs (with 96% of recruited participants ever enrolled in such trials), the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality for β-blockers versus placebo was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67–0.80) in sinus rhythm, while in patients with AF it was 0.97 (95% CI 0.83–1.14). The interaction p-value for baseline rhythm was highly significant at 0.002 with no heterogeneity.

The lack of benefit in AF was consistent across all sub-groups, including age categories, gender, NYHA class, and baseline heart rate. There were also no significant reductions in a range of secondary outcomes, despite a sample size of over 3000 patients, including CV hospitalization and composite clinical outcomes. These data are based on sub-group analysis, and the patients with AF differed from those in sinus rhythm. However, pooling individual patient data allows for more robust handling and statistical analysis, as well as sufficient power.

Clinicians should not expect a prognostic benefit from β-blockers in HFrEF patients with concomitant AF. However, there was no apparent harm, and patients may have other indications, such as symptom or heart rate control. We are currently exploring whether this variance in efficacy is due to heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or other fundamental differences in how AF patients respond.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: An umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^113H9m2z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This umbrella review across cardiovascular indications used meta-analytic data to clarify the evidence basis for beta-blockers in contemporary clinical practice. In patients with coronary disease, there is a trade-off between benefit and risk. Beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI) at the expense of higher rates of incident heart failure (HF), with no effect on mortality. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers reduced morbidity and mortality, but they had no effect in HFrEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation or those with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In perioperative patients, although beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI in those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, this was at the expense of increased mortality and stroke. Beta-blockers had no effect on any of the outcomes assessed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In hypertension, although beta-blockers had no significant effect compared to placebo or diuretics, they were inferior to renin-angiotensin system (RAS) antagonists and calcium channel blockers (CCB). These findings highlight the importance of an individualized assessment of indication, comorbidity, and understanding of the goal of therapy before the routine commencement of beta-blockers.

- **Certainty of evidence**: Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE guidelines. See Supplemental Table 4 for full details.

### Contemporary procedural trends of Watchman percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion in the United States [^116jFvpo]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). High credibility.

To determine trends in real-world utilization and in-hospital adverse events from Watchman implantation since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. The risk of embolic stroke caused by atrial fibrillation is reduced by oral anticoagulants, but not all patients can tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device has emerged as an alternative therapy.

The study utilized data from the National Inpatient Sample for the calendar years 2015–2017. The outcomes assessed included associated complications, in-hospital mortality, and resource utilization trends after Watchman implantation. Trends were analyzed using analysis of variance, and multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis determined predictors of mortality.

A total of 17,700 patients underwent Watchman implantation during the study period. There was a significant increase in the number of Watchman procedures performed over the study years, rising from 1,195 in 2015 to 11,165 devices in 2017 (p < 0.01). Additionally, there was a significant decline in the rate of complications, from 26.4% in 2015 to 7.9% in 2017 (p < 0.01), and inpatient mortality, from 1.3% in 2015 to 0.1% in 2017 (p < 0.01). Predictors of in-hospital mortality included a higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (odds ratio [OR]: 2.61 per 1-point increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.91–3.57), chronic blood loss anemia (OR: 3.63, 95% CI: 1.37–9.61), and coagulopathy (OR: 4.90, 95% CI: 2.32–10.35).

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, and more specifically with respect to patients with subclinical AF, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering initiating oral anticoagulation within a shared decision-making framework. This is advised in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes lasting ≥ 24 hours and with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent stroke risk, taking into account episode duration and individual patient risk.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: A network meta-analysis [^116GCgHa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The Watchman device is the most recent addition to the "antiembolic armamentarium". Indirect unadjusted pair-wise estimates obtained for the Watchman device in our study are consistent with a recent network meta-analysis. We showed that the Watchman device is significantly more effective than placebo/control, but there was no evidence to prove that the Watchman device is more effective than aspirin. The fact that, after adjustment for randomized controlled trial population characteristics, the effect of the Watchman device did not differ from any other comparator (including placebo/control) is likely an indicator of an insufficient statistical power of the knowledge base. Importantly, the Watchman device was ranked as the best life-saving antiembolic intervention.

Moreover, simultaneous clustered ranking for two of the most important outcomes (primary efficacy and all-cause mortality) included the Watchman device together with four NOACs in the cluster of most effective and safe interventions. Clearly, further development of LAA occlusion devices and techniques is needed. The EWOLUTION registry recently showed that the rate of periprocedural strokes and bleedings could be further decreased. Future randomized controlled trials of LAA occlusion devices are needed to prove the effectiveness of the LAA occlusion approach given that it remains unclear whether LAA is a mechanistically essential structure for stroke development in atrial fibrillation.

### Amplatzer amulet left atrial appendage occluder versus Watchman device for stroke prophylaxis (Amulet IDE): A randomized, controlled trial [^116KDH5T]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at a 3- to 5-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke attributable to the stagnation of blood flow in the left atrial appendage (LAA) that promotes local thrombus formation. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is effective in preventing thromboembolic events; however, its use is limited by poor adherence, the need for long-term treatment, side effects including bleeding, and drug interactions. Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) can prevent thrombus embolization. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved the single-seal mechanism Watchman device for LAA occlusion that requires 6 weeks of postprocedural anticoagulation.

LAAO with a single-seal mechanism may be incomplete because of the complex and variable anatomy of the LAA. A dual-seal device with an outer disc may overcome the limitations of anatomic heterogeneity, provide an improved seal of the LAA ostium, and reduce the risk of leak.

Long-term follow-up of patients in PROTECT-AF (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) demonstrated that LAAO reduced the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, disabling/fatal stroke, and death but not ischemic stroke compared with warfarin through 5 years. Although there are observational studies suggesting comparable implant success, procedural outcomes, and safety events, no randomized multicenter trial has compared different devices.

- **Limit progression**: Reduce the risk of AF progression to maintain better long-term health.
- **Reduce risks**: Lower the risk of hospitalizations, stroke, and mortality in patients with a recent diagnosis of AF.
- **Prevent complications**: Diminish the risk of developing dementia or worsening cardiac structural abnormalities.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^114KZfMr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a prevalence of 1% to 2% in the adult population. The majority of AF patients receive oral anticoagulation (OAC) to reduce the risk of stroke. Previous studies showed that approximately 13% of AF patients have a contraindication to OAC, and 2% have an absolute contraindication, most frequently due to a history of intracranial hemorrhage. Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has emerged as a feasible option for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF.

The rate of procedure-related complications with the WATCHMAN device at 7 days was 8.7% and 4.2% in the PROTECT-AF (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trials, respectively. However, the more recent EWOLUTION study (Evaluating Real-World Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology) has shown a considerably lower 7-day procedure-related complication rate (2.7%). The complication rate is not negligible but improves with higher annual hospital volume and operator experience. The real-world in-hospital adverse event rate is low (2.2%), as reported in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAA Occlusion Registry. In contemporary practice, patients are hospitalized overnight after LAAC and typically discharged the following day. Currently, there are limited data on same-day discharge (SDD) for LAAC. SDD following LAAC has the potential to improve patient throughput and satisfaction.

It cannot be determined, however, in the absence of a controlled comparison of Betapace versus no pharmacologic treatment (for example, in patients with implanted defibrillators) whether Betapace response causes improved survival or identifies a population with a good prognosis.

Betapace has not been shown to enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

- **Supraventricular arrhythmias**: Betapace AF has been studied in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AFIB/AFL) in two principal studies: one in patients with primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL, and the other in patients with primarily chronic AFIB.

	- In one study, a U.S. multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response trial was conducted on patients with symptomatic primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL. Three fixed dose levels of Betapace AF (80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg) twice daily and placebo were compared in 253 patients. In patients with reduced creatinine clearance (40 to 60 mL/min), the same doses were given once daily.

	- Patients were excluded for the following reasons: QT interval > 450 msec, creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min, intolerance to beta-blockers, bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome in the absence of an implanted pacemaker, asymptomatic AFIB/AFL or AFIB/AFL associated with syncope, embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute myocardial infarction within the previous 2 months, congestive heart failure, bronchial asthma or other contraindications to beta-blocker therapy, receiving potassium-losing diuretics without potassium replacement, use of ACE inhibitors, and uncorrected hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) or hypomagnesemia.

### β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^111a3XEk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Among patients with atrial fibrillation, there was no difference in heart rate between patients with and without β-blocker use (at discharge: 76 ± 14 versus 76 ± 15 bpm, P = 0.652; at 12 months: 79 ± 18 versus 28 ± 17 bpm, P = 0.891). Patients with a β-blocker at discharge had better baseline characteristics. In Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, patients with a β-blocker at discharge had better outcomes regardless of heart rate. Patients with slow heart rate and without β-blocker prescription had numerically higher 1-year mortality than those with β-blocker prescription (P = 0.239). Nonetheless, patients without a β-blocker and with high heart rate had the worst outcomes. After adjustment for significant covariates, β-blocker was not associated with improved 1-year all-cause mortality in all patients with atrial fibrillation; however, under stratification by heart rate, β-blocker was associated with a 37% reduced risk for mortality (HR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40–0.97; P = 0.037) in patients with high heart rate but not in those with slow heart rate.

- **Baseline characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation**: Patients with a β-blocker at discharge had better baseline characteristics.

Although beta-blockers are widely used in routine clinical practice, this analysis indicates that their overall clinical effect strongly depends on the clinical situation. In patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who are in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers show a clear benefit in terms of mortality reduction and lower rates of hospitalization. However, beta-blockers show neutral effects for many other clinical situations in the modern era and, in some cases, may cause harm.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^1112fr7X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Because of the safety concerns from the Watchman trials, the US FDA mandated the continued access registries CAP (Continued Access to PROTECT AF) and CAP2 (Continued Access to PREVAIL). Both are US FDA investigational devices exemption registries designed to gain further safety and efficacy data on the Watchman device in both trials. The registries have the same inclusion and exclusion criteria and treatment protocol as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL.

The CAP registry included 566 patients with an average follow-up of 50.1 months, whereas CAP2 included 578 patients with an average of 50.3 months. Both demonstrated similar procedural success rates (94%). The primary endpoint, a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, cardiovascular/unexplained death, and safety, occurred at a rate of 3.05 per 100 patient-years in CAP and 4.80 per 100 patient-years in CAP2. Total stroke rates were significantly lower in both registries (CAP, 78% reduction; CAP2, 69% reduction). Both registries contain the largest follow-up data of patients with the Watchman device. They reaffirm the safety and efficacy of LAAO for patients with nonvalvular AF.

A rigid anticoagulation protocol (VKA for 45 days, then DAPT for 6 months, and then lifelong aspirin) was part of the trial design in PROTECT AF and PREVAIL. Patients with contraindications to warfarin were excluded from these trials. However, in real-world populations, many patients cannot tolerate any anticoagulation because of bleeding. After LAAO, these patients end up using only DAPT, single antiplatelet therapy, or nothing at all.

### Cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device compared with warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^116GbptE]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

- **Background**: This research evaluates the cost-effectiveness of using the WATCHMAN device for left atrial appendage closure compared to traditional treatments such as warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. These treatments are specifically for secondary prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods and results**: Through an extensive analysis, the study demonstrated that the WATCHMAN device might offer a favorable cost-effectiveness profile in certain patient populations. This is particularly relevant for patients who face significant risks from long-term anticoagulation therapy. Various cost metrics and efficacy outcomes were meticulously compared against current traditional therapies.

- **Conclusions**: The findings suggest that the WATCHMAN device presents a viable alternative, with specific implications for healthcare decision-making in treating nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage in atrial fibrillation based on results from PROTECT AF versus PREVAIL [^116YXMnw]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Randomized trials of left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with the Watchman device have shown varying results, and its cost-effectiveness compared with anticoagulation has not been evaluated using all available contemporary trial data.

- **Methods and results**: We used a Markov decision model to estimate lifetime quality-adjusted survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness of LAA closure with Watchman, compared directly with warfarin and indirectly with dabigatran. This evaluation used data from the long-term (mean 3.8 year) follow-up of Percutaneous Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage Versus Warfarin Therapy for Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) and Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PREVAIL) randomized trials. Using data from PROTECT AF, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with warfarin and dabigatran were $20,486 and $23,422 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Using data from PREVAIL, LAA closure was dominated by warfarin and dabigatran, meaning that it was less effective (8.44, 8.54, and 8.59 quality-adjusted life years, respectively) and more costly. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year, LAA closure was cost-effective 90% and 9% of the time under PROTECT AF and PREVAIL assumptions, respectively. These results were sensitive to the rates of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage for LAA closure and medical anticoagulation.

### Overview of the Food and Drug Administration circulatory system devices panel meetings on WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure therapy [^113MmFW3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) technology is a percutaneously delivered permanent cardiac implant placed in the left atrial appendage (LAA). This device is designed to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in warfarin-eligible patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

The first circulatory system device panel reviewed the Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study in 2009, and a "not approvable" letter was issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on safety concerns. Subsequently, the FDA, collaboratively with the sponsor, designed a new Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAAC Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long-Term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) trial to address the earlier study limitations. A second panel was convened in December 2013 to review the results of PREVAIL and additional long-term follow-up data from PROTECT AF.

The second panel voted favorably 13 to 1 that the benefits of the WATCHMAN LAAC therapy do outweigh the risks for use in patients who meet the criteria specified in the proposed indication. Subsequently, and during the premarket approval review, updated data from the PREVAIL study revealed more ischemic strokes in the WATCHMAN group. This corresponded to a total of 13 ischemic strokes in the WATCHMAN group versus 1 in the control group. As a result of these strokes, the FDA called for a third panel to assess the benefit-risk profile of the WATCHMAN device.

This summary aims to describe the discussions and recommendations made during the panel meetings.

In regard to medical management for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning rate control, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend guiding the heart rate target by underlying patient symptoms. The aim is to achieve a resting heart rate of less than 100–110 beats per minute in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have heart failure and are eligible for rate control strategies.

### Commentary: Watch out for WATCHMAN device failures [^112sHUS7]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Low credibility.

In three patients, the device was explanted and the left atrial appendage (LAA) was excluded with either a suture or the AtriClip (AtriCure Inc, Mason, Ohio). In one patient, the device remained, and the LAA was excluded with the AtriClip, while in another patient, the device was excluded with a pericardial patch. LAA occlusion was 100% successful, with no flow or residual stump of the LAA; all patients underwent a maze procedure at the time of operation.

Several questions arise from this case series. First, why did three of these patients require valve replacements? Did the WATCHMAN device cause these valve pathologies, and if not, shouldn't these patients have been referred for surgical valve treatment and maze as the initial treatment? If the valve pathologies were caused by the device, it would be interesting to see on echocardiography how the device caused MR or aortic valve disease; there are case reports in the literature of MR and aortic stenosis caused by the WATCHMAN device. Second, while the immediate postoperative echocardiography findings are promising, we know that most failures occur late. This series would be strengthened by long-term imaging confirmation of LAA occlusion. Third, two of the patients remained on anticoagulation for six months; this seems unusual since both of the patients had preoperative bleeding complications. If the anticoagulation is for the prevention of thromboembolism after bioprosthetic valve replacement, then why was one of the patients on rivaroxaban, which is not the recommended anticoagulant, and why were both anticoagulated for six months, which is on the longer side for such cases?

### Cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device compared with warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^111PiPj4]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and an independent risk factor for stroke. Once an AF patient experiences an embolic event, the probability of a second event increases 2.6-fold. Traditionally, these patients have been managed with warfarin therapy, which may reduce the risk of stroke in AF by two thirds, provided patients are within therapeutic range and adherent to therapy. While effective at reducing the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism, warfarin therapy is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, lower quality of life (QoL), and high patient nonadherence.

Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapies and device-based left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) are alternatives for stroke prophylaxis in nonvalvular AF. Although long-term data are limited, the NOACs seem to be a safe and effective alternative to warfarin therapy, but are similar in that they are systemic solutions dependent on patient compliance. Autopsy/echocardiography studies indicate that over 90% of all thrombi in nonvalvular AF patients originate from the left atrial appendage. LAAC was developed to provide a localized solution independent of patient compliance.

The WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) for left atrial appendage closure seals the ostium of the left atrial appendage, preventing the embolization of thrombi formed therein. Results from a subgroup analysis of the PROTECT AF trial (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) indicated that LAAC also reduced [text cut off].

### Cardioprotection with beta-blockers: Myths, facts and Pascal's wager [^112WUjJ8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers were documented to reduce the reinfarction rate more than three decades ago and were subsequently touted as being cardioprotective for a broad spectrum of cardiovascular indications such as hypertension, diabetes, angina, atrial fibrillation, as well as perioperatively in patients undergoing surgery. However, despite lowering blood pressure, beta-blockers have never been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated hypertension. Beta-blockers do not prevent heart failure in hypertension any better than other antihypertensive drug classes. Additionally, beta-blockers have been shown to increase the risk of new-onset diabetes. When compared with nondiuretic antihypertensive drugs, beta-blockers increase all-cause mortality by 8% and stroke by 30% in patients with new-onset diabetes.

- **Rate control in atrial fibrillation**: Beta-blockers are useful for rate control in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation but do not help restore sinus rhythm or have antifibrillatory effects in the atria.
- **Stable angina**: Beta-blockers provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic stable angina but do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.
- **Adverse effects**: Common adverse effects of beta-blockers include fatigue, dizziness, depression, and sexual dysfunction.

However, beta-blockers remain a cornerstone in the management of patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction and for patients with heart failure. Therefore, recent evidence argues against the universal cardioprotective properties of beta-blockers but attests to their usefulness for specific cardiovascular indications.

### Antiarrhythmics for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^111BE3yT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia and often recurs after the restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been widely used to prevent recurrence. This is an update of a review previously published in 2006, 2012, and 2015.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of long-term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs on death, stroke, drug adverse effects, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation in people who had recovered sinus rhythm after having atrial fibrillation.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2019, and ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP in February 2019. We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles, recent reviews, and meta-analyses.

- **Selection criteria**: Two authors independently selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antiarrhythmic drug with a control (no treatment, placebo, or drugs for rate control) or with another antiarrhythmic drug in adults who had atrial fibrillation and in whom sinus rhythm was restored, either spontaneously or by any intervention. We excluded postoperative atrial fibrillation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We pooled studies, if appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All results were calculated at one year of follow-up or at the nearest time point.

- **Main results**: This update included one new study (100 participants) and excluded one previously included study because of double publication. Finally, we included 59 studies in total for analysis.

### The clinical impact of incomplete left atrial appendage closure with the Watchman device in patients with atrial fibrillation: A PROTECT AF (Percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage versus warfarin therapy for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation) substudy [^1172nbqq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical impact of incomplete left atrial appendage (LAA) sealing and consequent peri-device residual blood flow in patients undergoing percutaneous LAA closure with the Watchman device (Atritech, Inc, Plymouth, Minnesota).

During percutaneous LAA closure for stroke prophylaxis, the geometric variability of the LAA ostium may result in an incomplete seal of the LAA. On the one hand, this could enhance thrombus formation and embolization of thrombi around the device into the circulation; on the other hand, the relatively small size of these leaks may preclude clinically relevant embolizations.

Patients randomly assigned to device implantation in the PROTECT AF (Percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage versus warfarin therapy for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation) trial were analyzed. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months. Per the study protocol, patients discontinued warfarin therapy if the 45-day transesophageal echocardiogram revealed either minimal or no peri-device flow (jet ≤ 5 mm width). The impact of peri-device flow severity, defined as minor, moderate, or major (3 mm, respectively) on the composite primary efficacy endpoint (stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death) is expressed as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Transesophageal echocardiography follow-up revealed that 32.0% of implanted patients had at least some degree of peri-device flow.

### β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^113LDtQF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Overall, 2058 (60.3%) patients presented with sinus rhythm, whereas 826 (28.6%) patients had atrial fibrillation. Regarding the patients with sinus rhythm, those receiving β-blockers exhibited lower heart rates.

- **Heart rate stratification**: Under stratification by heart rate, among patients with slow heart rate, there was no significant difference in heart rate between those receiving or not receiving β-blockers after 3 months of follow-up. The heart rates recorded were as follows: at discharge, 62.8 ± 5.0 bpm for those with β-blockers versus 62.0 ± 5.2 bpm for those without (P = 0.087); at 1 month, 70.8 ± 12.3 bpm versus 74.7 ± 16.1 bpm (P = 0.026); at 3 months, 72.6 ± 13.5 bpm versus 72.1 ± 18.1 bpm (P = 0.815); at 6 months, 71.6 ± 14.3 bpm versus 72.0 ± 14.1 bpm (P = 0.818); and at 12 months, 73.6 ± 13.2 bpm versus 74.5 ± 13.8 bpm (P = 0.630).

- **High heart rate patients**: Among patients with a high heart rate, those using β-blockers consistently showed lower heart rates throughout the follow-up period.

- **Mortality outcomes**: Concerning the outcomes, only patients with a high heart rate who were not prescribed β-blockers experienced higher 1-year all-cause mortality. No significant differences were observed among the other patient groups (Figure 4 A).

### Early Canadian multicenter experience with WATCHMAN for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure [^114pNC2h]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

There are limited data regarding the use of WATCHMAN (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA, USA) for left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and contraindications to anticoagulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of WATCHMAN in our early Canadian experience.

- **Methods**: We report our pooled consecutive series of patients who underwent WATCHMAN implantation at four major Canadian centers. Indications for LAA closure were CHADS2 ≥ 1 or CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, with contraindication/intolerance to or failure on anticoagulation. Follow-up imaging was typically performed 1–6 months postprocedure.

- **Results**: One hundred and six patients underwent LAA closure with WATCHMAN from May 2013 to October 2015. The mean age was 74.8 ± 7.7 years, mean CHADS2 score was 2.8 ± 1.2, CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.3 ± 1.5, and HAS-BLED score was 3.2 ± 1.2. Permanent AF was present in 67.9% and paroxysmal AF in 32.1%. Indications for LAA closure were prior bleeding in 89.6% of cases (87 major bleeding and 8 minor bleeding), with 9.4% deemed high risk for bleeding and 0.9% experiencing strokes on warfarin. Procedural success was 97.2% (103 of 106), with one device embolization (snared percutaneously), one implant failure due to inadequate LAA depth, and one cardiac perforation requiring surgical repair before WATCHMAN implantation. The composite major safety event rate was 1.9% (1 death and 1 device embolization). The mean hospital stay was 1.8 ± 4.7 days. Antithrombotic therapy postimplant included dual antiplatelet therapy in 76 of 103 patients.

### Efficacy of β blockers in patients with heart failure plus atrial fibrillation: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^113NwaUu]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure often coexist, causing substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. β blockers are indicated in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; however, the efficacy of these drugs in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation is uncertain. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of individual-patient data to assess the efficacy of β blockers in patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm compared with atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We extracted individual-patient data from ten randomized controlled trials comparing β blockers versus placebo in heart failure. The presence of sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation was ascertained from the baseline electrocardiograph. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, analyzed by intention to treat. Outcome data were meta-analyzed using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. The study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT0083244, and PROSPERO, number CRD42014010012.

- **Findings**: A total of 18,254 patients were assessed, of which 13,946 (76%) had sinus rhythm and 3,066 (17%) had atrial fibrillation at baseline. Crude death rates over a mean follow-up of 1.5 years (SD 1.1) were 16% (2,237 of 13,945) in patients with sinus rhythm and 21% (633 of 3,064) in patients with atrial fibrillation. β-blocker therapy led to a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with sinus rhythm (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.67–0.80; p < 0.001), but not in patients with atrial fibrillation (0.97, 0.83–1.14; p = 0.73), with a significant p value for the interaction.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically concerning anticoagulant therapy, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend initiating direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin. This is to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who do not have a history of moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) or a mechanical heart valve and are eligible for anticoagulation.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^114Lm1fq]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning pre-procedural anticoagulation interruption, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend preferring continued anticoagulation over the interruption of warfarin. Bridging anticoagulation with heparin should be avoided to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are receiving warfarin and have an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5%. This recommendation is particularly pertinent for those undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change.

This study also had the following limitations. First, this study was a study‐level meta‐analysis, and the original data of all included studies was not obtained, which means the influence of the baseline data on the results of this study is unknown. Second, the duration of the included studies was long, and the experience of the operators may have influenced the results. Additionally, the antithrombotic strategies of the included studies were different, and the influence of antithrombotic strategies on the results could not be analyzed. Finally, the follow‐up time of the included studies ranged from 3−48 months, and different follow‐up times can affect the effective and safety endpoints.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^1163kV9u]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with atrial flutter, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of long-term anticoagulation after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. This recommendation applies to patients with typical atrial flutter who have no known previous history of atrial fibrillation but are at high risk for its development. Factors such as left atrium enlargement, inducible atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure (HF) are considered. If the thromboembolic risk assessment suggests a high risk (greater than 2% annual risk) of stroke, anticoagulation should be considered.

### Assessment of rhythm and rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111bjw4d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

A recent series of randomized prospective clinical trials compared rate control with rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and found no significant difference in the primary outcome between the two strategies. However, these trials lacked clear criteria for defining "successful" rate or rhythm control. Various measures have been used to gauge the success of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, including time to first recurrence of AF, any AF recurrence, AF burden, and a reduction in symptoms.

Determining the success of antiarrhythmic therapy can be relatively straightforward by using how patients feel during therapy as a key endpoint. Most patients are satisfied with a major reduction in symptomatic AF episodes and can live comfortably with occasional episodes of AF. For those who are bothered by even infrequent, brief AF episodes, a treatment regimen that eliminates nearly all AF recurrences is required, although often hard to achieve. Catheter ablation may be necessary to achieve a successful outcome in these patients.

Suppression of AF in a patient at high risk of stroke does not, however, remove the need for concomitant warfarin therapy. The endpoints of ventricular rate control are not clear, and the recently published rhythm versus rate control trials lacked standard criteria for judging acceptable rate control. One relatively simple method is to try and achieve a 24-hour heart rate that mimics expected normal sinus rhythm. It is important to achieve good rate control to minimize symptoms and the risk of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative AF, rate and rhythm control, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend administering rate control (target heart rate < 100 bpm) and/or rhythm control agents as initial therapy in hemodynamically stable patients with postoperative AF after cardiac surgery. The choice of strategy should be decided according to patient symptoms, hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmia, and physician preference.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the resumption of anticoagulation following a delay of 4–8 weeks. This approach aims to balance the risks of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications, necessitating a careful risk-benefit assessment for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ICH.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^114SLN7p]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent cardiovascular disease, and it is estimated that it will afflict over 12 million Americans by 2030. Patients with AF are at an increased risk for stroke, due primarily to stagnant blood in the fibrillating atrium forming a thrombus, which can then embolize to the cerebral circulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of these thrombi develop in the left atrial appendage. Historically, patients with AF have been stratified for ischemic stroke risk based on demographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment with oral anticoagulation was recommended for all but the lowest-risk patients. Oral anticoagulation, however, presents its own risks, primarily of bleeding. First approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the WATCHMAN device was developed to prevent thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage for patients with AF and at least moderate risk of AF-related thromboembolism.

There are limited long-term data available on outcomes in patients who undergo left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with WATCHMAN in routine clinical practice. Claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are a useful source of long-term follow-up data, since most patients eligible for and treated with WATCHMAN are Medicare beneficiaries. During the early period following market authorization of the WATCHMAN device, there were no other commercially available LAAO devices that shared similar coding. Furthermore, many of the outcomes of interest following LAAO, including death and stroke, are captured in these data.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy and pericardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend administering therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3–6 weeks. This should be followed by repeat imaging before cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation if cardioversion is deferred due to left atrial appendage thrombus detected on pre-cardioversion imaging.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^1179soyG]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

Our study assessed the seven-day procedure/device-related complications, comparing them with prior WATCHMAN studies, as depicted in Figure 5. CAP indicates Continued Access to PROTECT-AF; EWOLUTION represents Evaluating Real-World Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology; PREVAIL refers to the Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy; and PROTECT-AF involves the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.

A retrospective single-center study conducted in the United Kingdom reported same-day discharge (SDD) in 66% of patients after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) with acceptable in-hospital adverse event rates. In that study, 50.4% of patients underwent LAAC with the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, 41% with the Amulet Occluder, and 2.5% with the WATCHMAN device. The study did not report clinical outcomes during follow-up post-discharge. Notably, patients were discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy for four weeks, followed by a single antiplatelet for at least six months, aligning with European recommendations for patients not suitable for oral anticoagulation (OAC).

In North America, patients are typically maintained on OAC and aspirin for 45 days and then transitioned to dual antiplatelet therapy for six months, contingent upon the 45-day transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing an absence of peri-device flow > 5 mm or device-related thrombus. This practice is consistent with the study protocol of previous trials where warfarin was used exclusively. However, direct OACs may be a preferable alternative to warfarin for short-term anticoagulation.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^116TyYiK]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are widely used for many cardiovascular conditions; however, their efficacy in contemporary clinical practice remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospectively designed umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the evidence of beta-blockers in the contemporary management of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), patients undergoing surgery, or hypertension (registration: PROSPERO CRD42016038375). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception until December 2018. Outcomes were analysed as beta-blockers versus control for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), incident HF, or stroke. Two independent investigators abstracted the data, assessed the quality of the evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence.

- **Results**: We identified 98 meta-analyses, including 284 unique RCTs and 1,617,523 patient-years of follow-up. In CAD, 12 meta-analyses (93 RCTs, 103,481 patients) showed that beta-blockers reduced mortality in analyses before routine reperfusion, but there was a lack of benefit in contemporary studies where ≥ 50% of patients received thrombolytics or intervention. Beta-blockers reduced incident MI at the expense of increased HF. In HF with reduced ejection fraction, 34 meta-analyses (66 RCTs, 35,383 patients) demonstrated a reduction in mortality and HF hospitalisation with beta-blockers in sinus rhythm, but not in atrial fibrillation. In patients undergoing surgery, 23 meta-analyses (89 RCTs, 19,211 patients) showed no effect of beta-blockers on mortality.
