## Question

Vit D deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vitamin D deficiency, including its definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, screening, treatment, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency using current guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates and how they vary by population. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology to anchor why thresholds matter. After that, I need to review clinical manifestations, distinguishing skeletal from extraskeletal outcomes. Then, I should appraise screening recommendations and the quality of evidence. Finally, I will outline treatment strategies, including dosing, forms, and monitoring, and close with special populations and a concise synthesis that aligns with high-quality guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misstate it. Historically, deficiency has been defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL, and sufficiency as at least 30 ng/mL, which aligns with the 2011 Endocrine Society guideline and remains widely used clinically, though newer guidance has moved away from fixed targets for all outcomes [^115TEChd] [^11535HZz]. Wait, let me verify the latest stance: the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline explicitly no longer endorses a universal 30 ng/mL target and emphasizes that outcome-specific benefits have not been tied to distinct 25(OH)D thresholds, so I should not overgeneralize a single cut point to all clinical contexts [^11535HZz].

> I need to check prevalence next. Using the 20 ng/mL threshold, approximately 24.6% of US adults are deficient, whereas using 10 ng/mL, about 6% are deficient, underscoring how threshold choice drives prevalence estimates and policy implications [^115GCzBc]. Hold on, I should verify global and subgroup patterns: deficiency is more common in older adults, people with obesity, those with darker skin pigmentation, individuals with limited sun exposure, and residents at higher latitudes, which consistently elevates risk across studies and guidelines [^1144Ymwq] [^113qUrfH].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure the thresholds make mechanistic sense. Vitamin D promotes intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption; when 25(OH)D falls, calcium absorption drops, triggering secondary hyperparathyroidism that increases bone resorption and can impair mineralization, leading to osteomalacia in severe deficiency and contributing to osteoporosis and fractures over time, especially in older adults [^1165kh6X] [^112o28dR]. I should double-check that this mechanism explains why very low levels correlate with rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, which it does, and why correction of deficiency reverses biochemical abnormalities and bone pain in many cases [^1165kh6X].

> Next, I should review clinical manifestations, starting with skeletal outcomes. In children, severe deficiency causes rickets with bone deformities, growth failure, and hypocalcemia; in adults, osteomalacia presents with diffuse bone pain, tenderness, and proximal muscle weakness, and chronic deficiency contributes to bone loss and fractures, particularly in the elderly [^116wNRwz] [^112MUsjc] [^1165kh6X]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about extraskeletal benefits; large RCTs in largely replete populations have not shown consistent reductions in fractures, falls, cancer, or cardiovascular events, though meta-analyses suggest potential mortality benefit in older adults and signals for benefit in deficiency-prone subgroups, so I should qualify those claims carefully [^1165kh6X] [^117Va2Uq].

> I will now examine screening recommendations, and I need to be precise about the strength of evidence. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening of asymptomatic, community-dwelling adults for vitamin D deficiency, citing lack of demonstrated net benefit and concerns about assay variability and overdiagnosis [^111UJRQk] [^113MKBT4]. The 2024 Endocrine Society similarly recommends against routine 25(OH)D testing in the general population, including adults with obesity or dark complexion, and emphasizes empiric supplementation in selected groups rather than screening to a fixed threshold [^11535HZz] [^112vxbMP]. But wait, what if the patient is high risk? Targeted testing remains reasonable in patients with conditions that predispose to deficiency or when results would change management, such as malabsorption, chronic liver or kidney disease, bariatric surgery, prolonged anticonvulsant or glucocorticoid use, or symptomatic presentations suggestive of deficiency [^1123HSa4] [^113qUrfH].

> Let me think about treatment, and I should confirm dosing by severity and population. For adults with deficiency, 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for 8 weeks or approximately 6,000 IU daily achieves repletion in most, followed by maintenance of 1,500–2,000 IU daily; higher doses, often 2–3 times standard, are needed in obesity, malabsorption, or with medications that accelerate catabolism [^116Tw7ci] [^115rP1Fz]. I should verify pediatric regimens: infants and children generally receive 2,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly for about 6 weeks, then 400–1,000 IU daily for maintenance, with adjustments for age and risk factors; for infants, 400 IU daily prevents rickets and maintains sufficiency in most [^111X74a6] [^111JncrE] [^115p3Vhx]. Hold on, I should confirm that cholecalciferol (D3) is preferred over ergocalciferol (D2) for repletion due to higher potency and longer half-life; yes, most contemporary guidance favors D3 for treatment and maintenance when available [^11639dQb].

> I need to ensure I address monitoring and safety. After a loading regimen, checking serum calcium about 1 month later helps detect unmasked primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; routine 25(OH)D monitoring is generally unnecessary in stable patients on maintenance, but reassessment at 8–12 weeks is reasonable if compliance is uncertain, symptoms persist, or risk factors are dynamic [^113zRN7e] [^113cP2er]. I should confirm toxicity thresholds: 25(OH)D above about 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L) is associated with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, and intermittent high-dose bolus regimens may increase fall risk in older adults, so daily dosing is generally preferred when supplementing for prevention [^111rZo4X] [^117Va2Uq].

> Next, I should review special populations where guidance diverges. In chronic kidney disease, correcting native vitamin D deficiency follows general-population strategies, but active vitamin D analogs are reserved for secondary hyperparathyroidism and mineral bone disorder management, not for simple deficiency repletion [^117H4u7R] [^1113Mtyi]. In pregnancy, the 2024 Endocrine Society suggests empiric vitamin D to potentially reduce preeclampsia, preterm birth, and related outcomes, and some guidelines allow targeted testing in high-risk pregnant patients, though routine screening remains debated [^111U4Jbv] [^111eaJDt]. For older adults, especially those 75 and over, empiric daily vitamin D is suggested to potentially lower mortality, aligning with a population-level preventive approach rather than screening-based strategies [^113h9V6a]. For individuals with obesity or after bariatric surgery, higher doses and closer monitoring are warranted due to lower circulating 25(OH)D and malabsorption risk [^115rP1Fz] [^115eZPT9].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Vitamin D deficiency is common and clinically meaningful for skeletal outcomes, with the clearest benefits of correction seen in patients who are deficient or at high risk; however, routine screening of asymptomatic, low-risk adults is not supported by current high-quality evidence, and empiric supplementation should be prioritized in defined groups such as older adults, children and adolescents, pregnant individuals, and those with prediabetes, while targeted testing remains appropriate for high-risk clinical scenarios [^11535HZz] [^111UJRQk] [^117Va2Uq]. I should double-check that this aligns with both the USPSTF I statement and the Endocrine Society's shift toward empiric strategies and away from universal thresholds, which it does, while still allowing clinician judgment for individualized care [^111UJRQk] [^11535HZz].

Vitamin D deficiency is defined as **25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)** [^115TEChd] and is common worldwide, especially in older adults, people with dark skin, those with limited sun exposure, and individuals with obesity or malabsorption [^1144Ymwq] [^113qUrfH]. It impairs calcium absorption, causing secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss, osteomalacia, and rickets, and increases fracture risk [^1165kh6X] [^116wNRwz]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk]; test only those at risk or with symptoms [^1123HSa4]. Treat deficiency with **vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks** [^116Tw7ci] or 6,000 IU daily, then maintain with 800–2,000 IU daily [^116Tw7ci]; higher doses are needed in obesity or malabsorption [^115rP1Fz]. Monitor calcium and 25(OH)D if high-dose or high-risk, and correct deficiency before initiating antiresorptives [^113zRN7e].

---

## Definition and classification

Vitamin D status is classified by serum 25(OH)D [^114xwr92]:

| **Category** | **Serum 25(OH)D level** |
|-|-|
| Deficiency | < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) [^115TEChd] |
| Insufficiency | 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L) [^115TEChd] |
| Sufficiency | ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) [^notfound] |

---

## Epidemiology

Vitamin D deficiency is **highly prevalent globally** [^116Q4h2v], with about 24% of US adults deficient by the < 20 ng/mL definition [^115GCzBc]. Prevalence is higher in older adults, people with dark skin, those with limited sun exposure, and individuals with obesity or malabsorption [^1144Ymwq] [^113qUrfH].

---

## Pathophysiology

Vitamin D promotes intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption; deficiency reduces absorption, lowers serum calcium, and triggers secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases bone resorption, causes bone loss, and impairs mineralization, leading to osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children [^1165kh6X] [^116wNRwz].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Skeletal**: Bone pain, muscle weakness, osteomalacia, rickets, increased fracture risk [^1165kh6X] [^116wNRwz].
- **Extraskeletal**: Associations with increased risk of infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, though causality remains uncertain [^112o28dR] [^113UqxEs].
- **Asymptomatic**: Many individuals have no symptoms, especially with mild deficiency [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Risk factors

- **Limited sun exposure**: Indoor lifestyle, high latitude, clothing, sunscreen [^1144Ymwq].
- **Skin pigmentation**: Darker skin reduces cutaneous synthesis [^1144Ymwq].
- **Age**: Elderly have reduced skin synthesis and intake [^1144Ymwq].
- **Obesity**: Sequestration in adipose tissue lowers bioavailability [^113qUrfH].
- **Malabsorption**: Celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery [^1144Ymwq].
- **Medications**: Glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, HIV therapies [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Diagnosis and screening

Serum 25(OH)D is the **primary biomarker** of vitamin D status [^114xwr92]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk]; test only those at risk or with suggestive symptoms [^1123HSa4].

---

## Treatment

- **Initial therapy**: 50,000 IU vitamin D2/D3 weekly for 8 weeks or 6,000 IU daily [^116Tw7ci].
- **Maintenance therapy**: 800–2,000 IU daily after repletion [^116Tw7ci].
- **Special populations**: Higher doses (e.g. 6,000–10,000 IU/day) may be needed in obesity or malabsorption [^115rP1Fz].
- **Formulations**: Cholecalciferol (D3) is preferred for its potency and duration [^11639dQb].

---

## Monitoring and prevention

Monitor serum 25(OH)D and calcium in high-dose regimens or high-risk patients [^113cP2er]. Maintain serum 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL in high-risk groups [^116Tw7ci]. Prevention relies on moderate sun exposure, dietary intake, and supplementation in at-risk groups [^116sT4h1].

---

## Special considerations

In chronic kidney disease, correct **25(OH)D deficiency** using general-population strategies, reserving active vitamin D for CKD-MBD management [^117H4u7R] [^1113Mtyi]. In pregnancy, consider empiric vitamin D to reduce risks such as preeclampsia and preterm birth [^111U4Jbv]. In older adults, empiric vitamin D may reduce mortality [^113h9V6a].

---

Vitamin D deficiency is common and has significant skeletal consequences; **targeted testing and treatment** are recommended, with routine screening not advised for asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk].

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25-40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1114pUyw]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — clinical stages and manifestations: The clinical presentation of vitamin D–deficiency rickets includes symptoms and signs of bone deformity and/or pain and may be associated with hypocalcemia and associated clinical features. The disease can be divided into 3 stages; the first stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical or overt hypocalcemia, followed in the second stage by rising PTH levels, and in the final stage bone changes become more severe with hypocalcemia again evident. Symptoms range from none to irritability, delay in gross motor development, and bone pain, and signs include widening of the wrists and ankles, genu varum or valgum, prominence of the costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), delayed closure of fontanelles, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Vitamin D deficiency presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or tetany is reported more frequently in infancy and adolescence than in childhood; hypocalcemic children may have apneic spells, stridor or wheezing, hypotonia, muscular weakness, and brisk reflexes, and severe deficiency may be associated with cardiomyopathy related to hypocalcemia that normalizes with treatment.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Osteomalacia as a result of vitamin D deficiency [^112MUsjc]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Osteomalacia is an end-stage bone disease of chronic and severe vitamin D or phosphate depletion of any cause. Its importance has increased because of the rising incidence of vitamin D deficiency. Yet, not all cases of osteomalacia are cured by vitamin D replacement, and furthermore, not all individuals with vitamin D deficiency develop osteomalacia. Although in the past osteomalacia was commonly caused by malabsorption, nutritional deficiency now is more common. In addition, recent literature suggests that nutritional vitamin D deficiency osteomalacia follows various bariatric surgeries for morbid obesity. Bone pain, tenderness, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking are all common clinical manifestations of osteomalacia. Diagnostic work-up involves biochemical assessment of vitamin D status and may also include a transiliac bone biopsy. Treatment is based on aggressive vitamin D repletion in most cases with follow-up biopsies if patients are started on antiresorptive or anabolic agents.

### Global prevalence and disease burden of vitamin D deficiency… [^112jFCd6]. stacks.cdc.gov (2018). Low credibility.

Global prevalence and disease burden of vitamin D deficiency: a roadmap for action in low- and middle-income countries Supporting Files 10 2018 By Roth, Daniel E.; Abrams, Steven A.; Aloia, John;. File Language: English. Description: Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for bone health and may influence the risks of respiratory illness, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and chronic diseases of adulthood. Because many countries have a relatively low supply of foods rich in vitamin D and inadequate exposure to natural ultraviolet B radiation from sunlight, an important proportion of the global population is at risk of vitamin D deficiency. There is general agreement that the minimum serum/plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration D) that protects against vitamin D deficiency-related bone disease is approximately 30 nmol/L; therefore, this threshold is suitable to define vitamin D deficiency in population surveys.

However, efforts to assess the vitamin D status of populations in low- and middle-income countries have been hampered by limited availability of population-representative 25D data, particularly among population subgroups most vulnerable to the skeletal and potential extraskeletal consequences of low vitamin D status, namely exclusively breastfed infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly. In the absence of 25D data, identification of communities that would benefit from public health interventions to improve vitamin D status may require proxy indicators of the population risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as the prevalence of rickets or metrics of usual UVB exposure. If a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is identified D < 30 nmol/L) or the risk for vitamin D deficiency is determined to be high based on proxy indicators, food fortification and/or targeted vitamin D supplementation policies can be implemented to reduce the burden of vitamin D deficiency-related conditions in vulnerable populations.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XbWDR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

New USPSTF recommendation on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

National guidance on the management of vitamin D

Unsurprisingly, this has led to controversy and confusion in the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to help will clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians and other practising clinicians containing key recommendations around
best way of estimating vitamin D status;
recommendations for vitamin D testing;
threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency;
treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on maintenance therapy;
guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance, and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of their patients.

Key points

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high world-wide, particularly in the elderly.
25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
Muscle weakness due to vitamin deficiency is reversible with vitamin D supplementation.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1145ZUz5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Vitamin D treatment for connective tissue diseases: hope beyond the hype? [^113GQvHE]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is increased among patients with CTDs. The active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) is a potent regulator of the immune system and may suppress inflammatory responses. This has led to claims that vitamin D may be a safe treatment, or a treatment adjunct, to reduce systemic inflammation in this patient population. It is important to note, however, that there is insufficient evidence from robust clinical trials to support these novel uses for vitamin D. In this review we examine the potential role of vitamin D as a treatment adjunct for CTDs. We will discuss how vitamin D may modulate the immune response and review the current evidence for using vitamin D to treat CTDs and their associated co-morbidities. We conclude that while there is much excitement about vitamin D in this context, further well-designed trials are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of patients with CTDs.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### An update on the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis: evidence-based recommendations from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^114qJU66]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to develop evidence-based clinical care guidelines for the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Participants

The guidelines committee was comprised of physicians, registered dietitians, a pharmacist, a nurse, a parent of an individual with CF, and a health scientist, all with experience in CF.

Process

Committee members developed questions specific to vitamin D health in individuals with CF. Systematic reviews were completed for each question. The committee reviewed and graded the available evidence and developed evidence-based recommendations and consensus recommendations when insufficient evidence was available. Each consensus recommendation was voted upon by an anonymous process.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is common in CF. Given the limited evidence specific to CF, the committee provided consensus recommendations for most of the recommendations. The committee recommends yearly screening for vitamin D status, preferably at the end of winter, using the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, with a minimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) considered vitamin D sufficient in individuals with CF. Recommendations for age-specific vitamin D intake for all individuals with CF, form of vitamin D, and a stepwise approach to increase vitamin D intake when optimal vitamin D status is not achieved are delineated.

### Should we screen for vitamin D deficiency? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113hNi1n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency. The guidelines were based on randomized trials of vitamin D deficiency screening and treatment, as well as on case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative. The USPSTF concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. Compared with placebo or no treatment, vitamin D was associated with decreased mortality; however, benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded. Vitamin D treatment was associated with a possible decreased risk for at least 1 fall and the total number of falls per person but not for fractures. None of the studies examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus not screening on clinical outcomes. In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent endocrinologists debate the issue of screening for vitamin D deficiency in a 55-year-old, asymptomatic, postmenopausal woman. They review the data on which the USPSTF recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of screening for vitamin D deficiency in primary care practice.

### Global consensus recommendations on prevention and management of nutritional rickets [^116wNRwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication.

Evidence

A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence.

Process

Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus.

Results

This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts.

Conclusion

Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required.

### Vitamin D and child health part 1 (skeletal aspects) [^1174bRGV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable clinical and academic interest in vitamin D as a consequence of a number of developments over the past decade. This was initially related to a recognised resurgence of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children in the UK and other countries. The potential importance of maternal vitamin D status on bone mass in early childhood and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peak bone mass has been the subject of much research. An additional development has been the recognition that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and what level should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review consists of two parts, the first focuses on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D, while the second will review some of the potential extraskeletal aspects, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)₂D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### IOM committee members respond to endocrine society vitamin D guideline [^113736uM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^112o28dR]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

"RCTs using vitamin D supplementation to prevent or improve possible nonskeletal diseases related to poor vitamin D status have generated mixed results".

There is also general consensus that severe vitamin D deficiency or absence of 1,25(OH)₂D (as in chronic renal failure) later in life can cause osteomalacia. Milder degrees of vitamin D deficiency generate secondary hyperparathyroidism in most but not all subjects of various ages and accelerates bone turnover and ultimately accelerates bone loss and the risk of fractures in the elderly.

In selected populations, RCTs with vitamin D and calcium supplementation demonstrated a decreased incidence of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures of ∼15%, with the effect being greater (i) in 80+ and 70 to 80 years of age persons than in persons 60 to 70 years of age, (ii) in those who are institutionalized in comparison with community living elderly, (iii) when vitamin D is combined with calcium supplementation, and (4) when compliance is > 80%. Nearly all major governmental guidelines confirm this policy and recommend that serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L should be avoided. Some expert groups (UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition), however, consider this conclusion still not sufficiently validated to recommend specific supplementation beyond what is needed to prevent rickets/osteomalacia. Other experts and grassroots organizations recommend much higher intake and aim for much higher serum 25OHD concentrations based on observational data and comparison with serum 25OHD levels in individuals living in circumstances similar to those of early humans.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^11639dQb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

### Pharmacologic therapy for vitamin D deficiency… [^113fT4tP]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D therapy may be given daily or weekly with equal effectiveness; the dosage depends on the degree of deficiency. The cumulative dosage is more important than dosing frequency, so the choice of daily, weekly, or monthly dosing can be based on patient preference. Vitamin D levels should be rechecked after three months to ensure adequate response. Evidence Summary There is no consensus on an adequate vitamin D level, but most experts recommend a level greater than 30 ng per mL for optimal musculoskeletal and metabolic health. 1 However, a report from the Institute of Medicine states that a level greater than 20 ng per mL is sufficient. 2 Exposure to sunlight corrects some deficiencies, but adequate dosing depends on latitude, skin pigmentation, and age.

1.

DOSAGE A review of two RCTs on vitamin D repletion concluded that daily oral dosages of 1, 160 to 2, 200 IU are needed to reach and maintain serum levels greater than 30 ng per mL.

1. A prospective cohort study of 208 vitamin D–deficient patients 18 to 88 years of age found that, based on body weight and degree of deficiency, almost equivalent dosages of cholecalciferol were needed to produce a serum level greater than 30 ng per mL.
6. A second RCT of 338 older adults receiving cumulative doses equivalent to 600 IU of cholecalciferol per day for more than four months found that mean serum vitamin D levels were greatest with daily dosing compared with weekly and monthly dosing.

Recommendations from Others The Endocrine Society recommends that adults who are deficient in vitamin D receive 50, 000 IU of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol weekly for eight weeks, based on a study of 38 patients who received ergocalciferol. 10.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

Abstract

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

Vitamin D screening considerations in generally healthy adults — The panel noted that low vitamin D status has been linked to a number of important health problems and agreed that adverse effects may manifest only after a long latency period, with early detection plausibly improving long-term outcomes; they emphasized that the condition has a latent (preclinical) phase and that persons with positive screening results would be managed differently from those with negative results. They agreed that vitamin D supplementation is widely available, inexpensive, and highly effective at raising 25(OH)D levels, and that high- or moderate-certainty evidence supports acceptable screening test accuracy, although there is still considerable variability of 25(OH)D assays. The systematic review did not identify any studies showing that 25(OH)D testing is harmful, and the panel did not identify harms related to screening other than financial costs; additional considerations included that effective management improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent phase and that any screening strategy should be cost-effective, acceptable to stakeholders, and feasible to implement. This section addresses whether to screen with a 25(OH)D test in generally healthy populations and does not specifically address how those with documented low levels of 25(OH)D should be evaluated or treated.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

Testing populations at risk of vitamin D deficiency — clinical approach

Measurement of 25(OH)D has been recommended in patients at risk for deficiency (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Thus, 25(OH)D is widely measured in many of these high-risk groups, for example, in older adults with decreased endogenous vitamin D production and prone to develop osteoporosis, in patients with parathyroid disorders and liver disease, and in patients with obesity. Patients with class III obesity (BMI > 40) present with low levels of 25(OH)D for various reasons, including nutritional factors, psychological reasons leading to less sun exposure, decreased hepatic expression of CYP2R1, and sequestration of the vitamin in the excess adipose tissue. Class III obesity may be addressed by bariatric surgery, which, by itself, may lead to malabsorption and, thereby, a further decrease of 25(OH)D levels, potentially followed by a secondary hyperparathyroidism. Other at-risk groups include those who are housebound, those working long hours indoors, dark-skinned individuals, patients with a chronic disease, those taking medications increasing vitamin D catabolism, etc (see Table 1). Paradoxically, listing situations where it may be reasonable to measure 25(OH)D accounts for most people. This would again result in overtesting with high costs for the health care system. Rather than testing in situations where it would be reasonable to, it would be better to test only in situations that actually warrant it. It comes down to the providers' judgment in first recognizing these high-risk individuals and then deciding to confirm with a measurement of 25(OH)D. There is, in fact, little evidence for the scientific utility and cost-effectiveness of testing for 25(OH)D deficiency, even in some of these selected groups. For example, some guidelines have recommended against screening pregnant women for vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for maternal and fetal outcomes. However, a case can be made for optimizing vitamin D status in all pregnant or breastfeeding women and their offspring, given the reemerging public health concern of rickets in high-risk children and potential benefits on future peak bone mass. Evidence of a relationship between low 25(OH)D and adverse maternal outcomes together with evidence that these adverse outcomes (eg, risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight, and the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage) are reduced after vitamin D supplementation have also been shown. Poor vitamin D status has also been associated with increased risk of low birth weight, increased risk of preterm birth, and offspring's adverse anthropometric and neurodevelopmental outcomes, while supplementation or sufficient vitamin D status was found to be protective against the risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age, and associated with improved offspring vitamin D sufficiency status, reduced fetal or neonatal mortality, and improved fetal and future linear growth.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

### Patient information: screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults… [^11594cLw]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. What Is Vitamin D Deficiency. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in calcium regulation and bone health. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, although in the US many foods are fortified with vitamin D. Most of the vitamin D the human body uses is made by the skin as a result of exposure to sunlight. After that, vitamin D is processed by the liver and kidney to be useful to the bones. Vitamin D deficiency results when a person does not get enough vitamin D from the skin or food or their liver and/or kidney has problems processing it. Every person has a different level of need for vitamin D, so an exact level of deficiency is difficult to define.

Significant vitamin D deficiency can result in bone problems for both children and adults. Many studies have suggested links between vitamin D deficiency and a variety of health concerns including depression, falls, fractures, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and infection; however, many of these links are inconclusive. This recommendation applies to nonpregnant adults who do not have any signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. What Are the Potential Benefits and Harms of Screening for Vitamin D Deficiency. The goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency is to identify and treat it before adverse clinical outcomes occur. However, there is currently not enough evidence to say whether screening for and treating asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency improves any of the health problems described above. Part of the challenge in interpreting studies is the variable definition of vitamin D deficiency.

Screening may misclassify people with vitamin D deficiency because of variability in cutoff values and among different tests. Another rare potential harm of screening is overtreatment with high-dose vitamin D supplements, which can lead to vitamin D toxicity. How Strong Is the Recommendation to Screen for Vitamin D Deficiency. Given current evidence, the USPSTF concludes that overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are rare genetic photodermatoses. Limited expertise with these disorders among physicians leads to diagnostic delays. Here, we present evidence-based consensus guidelines for the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria. A systematic literature review was conducted, and reviewed among subcommittees of experts, divided by topic. Consensus on guidelines was reached within each subcommittee and then among all members of the committee. The appropriate biochemical and genetic testing to establish the diagnosis is reviewed in addition to the interpretation of results. Prevention of symptoms, management of acute phototoxicity, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are discussed. The importance of ongoing monitoring for liver disease, iron deficiency, and vitamin D deficiency is discussed with management guidance. Finally, management of pregnancy and surgery and the safety of other therapies are summarized. We emphasize that these are multisystemic disorders that require longitudinal monitoring. These guidelines provide a structure for evidence-based diagnosis and management for practicing physicians. Early diagnosis and management of these disorders are essential, particularly given the availability of new and emerging therapies.

### Clinical heterogeneity and therapeutic options for idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia caused bypathogenic variant [^112DyGo1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Infantile hypercalcemia-1 (HCINF1) is a rare disease caused by pathogenic variants in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in the inability to metabolize active vitamin D. This leads to hypercalcemia and severe complications.

Content

On December 8th, 2022, a systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Wanfang, and CNKI using the keywords "hypercalcemia" and " CYP24A1 ". Data extraction included patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment medications, and outcomes. The findings were synthesized to identify common patterns and variations among cases and to assess the efficacy of different therapies in reducing serum calcium. Our findings revealed two distinct peaks in the incidence of HCINF1 caused by CYP24A1 pathogenic variant. Kidney stones or renal calcifications were the most common clinical manifestations of the disease, followed by polyuria and developmental delay. Laboratory investigations showed hypercalcemia, elevated vitamin D levels, hypercalciuria, and low parathyroid hormone. Genetic analysis remains the only reliable diagnostic tool. Although there is no definitive cure for HCINF1, multiple drugs, including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and rifampicin, have been used to control its symptoms. Blocking the production and intake of vitamin D is the preferred treatment option.

Summary and Outlook

Our review highlights the basic clinical and biochemical features of HCINF1 and suggests that targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are needed to address the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. The insights gained from this study may facilitate the development of innovative treatments for HCINF1.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115p3Vhx]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — use of supplements states "we recommend that all breastfed infants, and nonbreastfed infants and children who do not ingest at least 1 L of vitamin D–fortified milk per day, receive 400 IU vitamin D per day as a supplement", and notes that "supplementation with 400 IU/day is necessary for all breastfed infants" and should "begin within days of birth". For higher-risk groups, "Dark-skinned infants who are exclusively breastfed should receive at least 400 IU/day of vitamin D", "Preterm infants should be supplemented from birth with 400 to 800 IU/day", and the Canadian Paediatric Society "suggests supplementation with 800 IU/day for breastfed infants during the winter months"; those receiving higher doses "should be monitored at least yearly for 25(OH)-D levels". The review notes that "400 IU of vitamin D is sufficient to prevent rickets and maintain levels of > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)", while in adults "the recommended daily intake of vitamin D should be close to 1000 IU", pending pediatric data. Maternal high-dose options include "administration of high doses of vitamin D (4000–6400 IU daily) to breastfeeding mothers" which can raise infant 25(OH)-D without maternal hypervitaminosis D, and "High-dose vitamin D supplementation in nursing mothers… is another possible strategy for improving the vitamin D status of purely breastfeeding infants".

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, AACE/ACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to advise older adults, individuals with increased skin pigmentation, or those exposed to insufficient sunlight to increase their vitamin D intake from vitamin D-fortified foods and/or supplements to at least 800–1,000 IU/day.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111mfiHt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (daily requirements), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest a role of vitamin D status, based on deficiency of levels and treatment, in risk of COVID-19 infection. Randomized clinical trials of interventions to reduce vitamin D deficiency are needed to determine if those interventions could reduce COVID-19 incidence, including both broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and/or COVID-19.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^111yc5Hu]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Box 6 Recommendations for conventional treatment in adults

We recommend treatment in symptomatic adults with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) by active vitamin D together with oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) to reduce osteomalacia and its consequences and to improve oral health (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest treating pregnant and lactating women with active vitamin D in combination with phosphate supplements if needed (grade D, weak recommendation)
We do not recommend routine treatment of asymptomatic adults with XLH (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend using substantially lower doses of active vitamin D and oral phosphate than are used in children (grade C, moderate recommendation). We recommend a dose range of 750–1,600 mg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) for phosphate and of 0.50–0.75 and 0.75–1.5 μg daily for calcitriol and alfacalcidol, respectively (grade C, weak recommendation)
We recommend reducing doses of active vitamin D in patients in whom long-term immobilization is anticipated, to prevent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend stopping phosphate supplements in patients with markedly increased parathyroid hormone levels (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We suggest that active vitamin D might be given without phosphate supplements to adult patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism if careful follow-up is provided (grade D, weak recommendation)
We suggest supplementing patients with native vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) in case of vitamin D deficiency; we also suggest ensuring normal calcium intake (grade C, weak recommendation)

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^112JLweK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Generally, there is a lack of consensus about the recommended vitamin D supplementation regimen (doses, administration schedule, treatment duration, etc). Such heterogeneity can be explained, at least partly, by the scarcity of comparative pharmacokinetics studies for different dosing schedules. Moreover, different underlying conditions (eg, obesity) might reduce the effect of vitamin D supplementation. Growing evidence suggests that the treatment schedule itself (ie, bolus vs frequent administration) may differently affect the effectiveness of the treatment and also clinical outcomes, with recent studies and a few meta-analyses showing more promising results with frequent administration schedules on skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes.

In this perspective, vitamin D supplementation guidelines should be specific for age group, body weight, ethnicity (skin type), and latitude of residence. For example, differences in serum 25(OH)D by BMI and absolute body weight have been reported. Vitamin D dose per kilogram of body weight per day could explain a 34.5% variation in circulating 25(OH)D in multivariable regression analyses of data pooled from several studies, leading to pronounced differences across BMI categories. Obese and overweight individuals tend to have serum 25(OH)D levels that are, on average, around 20 nmol/L lower and 8 nmol/L lower than those of normal-weight individuals, requiring 2.6 and 1.47 times higher supplementation, respectively. This is somewhat consistent with ES guidelines suggesting that the vitamin D dosage for obese people is "three times" greater than the recommended dose for individuals with normal body weight.

Another example of targeted, specific vitamin D dosing, of course, is in the pediatric setting. Infants and children have different upper tolerance limits compared to adults. To maintain a desirable 25(OH)D concentration, the 2010 IOM guidelines recommend 600 IU/d (15 μg) for children, adolescents, and adults, and 400 IU/d (10 μg) for infants. ES guidelines recommend 400 to 1000 IU/day (10–25 μg) for infants aged up to 1 year and 600 to 1000 IU/day (15–25 μg) for children older than 1 year to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency. These values are consistent with several guidelines issued by other societies in the past several years. Of course, they can be increased if a laboratory-confirmed vitamin D deficiency is being treated.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^111rZo4X]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D excess and intoxication — definitions and thresholds are outlined with specific serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)-D] levels. Individuals with 25(OH)-D levels of ≥ 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) are described as having vitamin D excess and as being at risk for intoxication, while some laboratories set an upper limit of normal at 200 nmol/L (80 ng/mL). Observational contexts note that sunbathers and lifeguards can have 25(OH)-D levels of > 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) without evidence of intoxication, and supplementation leading to 25(OH)-D levels of 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) is not associated with harmful effects. Conversely, hypercalcemia is definitely associated with 25(OH)-D levels of > 325 nmol/L (150 ng/mL).

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.
