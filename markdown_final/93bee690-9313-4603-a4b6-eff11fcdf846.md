## Question

High tsh low free T4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting and managing high TSH with low free T4, including how to distinguish primary from central hypothyroidism, when to treat, and how to monitor therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and excluding assay interference. Then, I should verify whether this represents primary versus central hypothyroidism. Next, I will review etiologies and clinical implications, including special populations. After that, I need to determine treatment thresholds and dosing strategy. Finally, I should outline monitoring, follow-up, and when to refer, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any misstatements along the way.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical pattern and its meaning. High TSH with low free T4 defines overt primary hypothyroidism, reflecting failure of the thyroid gland with a compensatory rise in TSH, and this pattern is distinct from subclinical hypothyroidism where TSH is elevated but free T4 remains normal, so I should not conflate these entities [^1129gwkb] [^113mkwj1]. Wait, let me verify assay reliability before labeling the diagnosis; I need to check for biotin interference, heterophilic antibodies, and analytic variability, and if results are discordant with the clinical picture, I should repeat testing on an alternate platform or after a biotin washout to avoid misclassification [^114fiaqB] [^112jhSYv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology until I distinguish primary from central causes. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH is elevated and free T4 is low, whereas in central hypothyroidism the pituitary fails to produce adequate TSH, so free T4 is low with an inappropriately low or normal TSH; I should double-check that the TSH here is clearly elevated, which would argue against central disease in this case [^116Rq9QT] [^117NV6Ub]. I need to ensure I also consider non-thyroidal illness and medications that can suppress TSH or alter deiodination, but a frankly high TSH with low free T4 is most consistent with primary failure rather than central or non-thyroidal illness patterns [^113XpJMe].

> Next, I should review the most common etiologies. Let me think about autoimmune thyroiditis first; Hashimoto thyroiditis is the leading cause of primary hypothyroidism in adults, so I should check thyroid peroxidase antibodies to support the diagnosis and anticipate progression if present [^113mkwj1]. Iatrogenic causes include post-thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy, and I should remember that after hyperthyroidism treatment, TSH may remain suppressed for weeks to months, so free T4 and total T3 should guide early management rather than TSH alone in that window [^116o1x3e]. But wait, what if the patient is on amiodarone or has iodine deficiency or excess; these can precipitate hypothyroidism and should be considered in the history and medication review [^113XpJMe].

> I will now examine clinical implications and special populations. Overt hypothyroidism is unequivocally an indication for treatment given symptom burden and cardiovascular risk, and I should confirm that the patient has symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, or cognitive slowing before proceeding, while recognizing that some patients may be minimally symptomatic at presentation [^113mkwj1]. In pregnancy, I need to ensure prompt treatment with trimester-specific targets because maternal hypothyroidism can adversely affect fetal neurodevelopment, so I should not delay therapy in this setting [^1121spBy]. In older adults, I should be cautious with dosing to avoid overtreatment and consider that some data suggest fT4-based screening strategies may improve diagnostic efficiency in primary care, though I must balance this with guideline-based approaches that still prioritize TSH-first screening in most ambulatory settings [^111YjdBN] [^116XK1nC].

> Now, I should determine treatment thresholds and dosing. For overt primary hypothyroidism, treatment with levothyroxine is indicated regardless of TSH magnitude, and I should target normalization of TSH in primary disease; typical full replacement is about 1.6 mcg/kg/day, but I need to adjust for age, cardiac disease, and body weight, often starting lower in older or cardiac patients and titrating every 6–8 weeks until TSH is normalized [^113mkwj1] [^116Sn7Cd]. Wait, I initially thought a TSH above 10 mIU/L alone mandates treatment even if free T4 is normal; that applies to subclinical hypothyroidism, not overt disease, so I should correct that and emphasize that in overt hypothyroidism treatment is indicated irrespective of the specific TSH value because free T4 is already low [^114LBMH9] [^1151QfPg].

> Let me consider central hypothyroidism briefly to avoid a misstep. If I had found low free T4 with low or inappropriately normal TSH, I should not use TSH to guide therapy; instead, I would titrate levothyroxine to keep free T4 in the upper half of the reference range, recognizing that TSH is unreliable in this context and that dynamic TSH testing is not recommended for routine diagnosis [^116Rq9QT] [^112GQShE]. I should confirm pituitary involvement with appropriate imaging and co-axial hormone assessment if central disease is suspected, and I need to ensure I do not mistakenly apply primary hypothyroidism algorithms to central cases [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I need to check thyroid function tests about 6–8 weeks after initiation or dose change, aiming for a TSH in the reference range in primary hypothyroidism, and I should remember that TSH changes lag behind free T4 adjustments, so I must interpret values in that context and avoid overcorrecting too quickly [^113mkwj1]. Once stable, annual monitoring is reasonable, but I should increase frequency in pregnancy or if clinical status changes; in patients recovering from hyperthyroidism treatment, I should rely on free T4 and total T3 early on because TSH may remain suppressed for months, preventing premature dose changes [^116o1x3e]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not using free T3 to monitor hypothyroidism; T3 is generally not helpful in hypothyroidism monitoring and should not be used to guide levothyroxine dosing in primary disease [^117W8kM1].

> I should double-check special scenarios and confounders. Non-thyroidal illness can suppress TSH and lower T3, and occasionally T4, so if the patient is acutely ill, I should defer definitive interpretation and retest after recovery; similarly, medications like glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, and somatostatin analogs can suppress TSH and obscure primary hypothyroidism, so timing and context matter [^113XpJMe]. If I encounter discordant results such as high free T4 with nonsuppressed TSH, I must consider assay interference, resistance to thyroid hormone, or a TSH-secreting adenoma and pursue appropriate confirmatory testing before labeling the patient as hyperthyroid or hypothyroid [^11385f4o] [^115jXbXK].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education and safety. I should confirm that levothyroxine is taken fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, separated from calcium, iron, and certain antacids to optimize absorption, and I should counsel on consistent brand use and storage; if adherence or absorption is in doubt, I should reassess and consider alternate formulations or administration strategies [^1121spBy]. I should also warn about the risks of overtreatment, particularly in older adults, including atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis, and I should individualize targets in patients with comorbidities or central hypothyroidism where TSH is not a reliable guide [^116z1K3j] [^112GQShE].

High TSH with low free T4 indicates **overt primary hypothyroidism** [^113mkwj1], most often due to autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) [^113mkwj1]. Confirm with **repeat TSH and free T4**, check **anti-TPO antibodies** [^113n1g4j], and assess for symptoms and cardiovascular risk. Start **levothyroxine** [^113mkwj1] if symptomatic, TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, or if pregnant or planning pregnancy [^1121spBy]; start low and titrate to normalize TSH. Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually. If central hypothyroidism is suspected (low/inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4) [^116Rq9QT], evaluate the pituitary and treat with levothyroxine, targeting free T4 rather than TSH [^112GQShE].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **most common causes** of high TSH and low free T4 include:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Primary hypothyroidism | - Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) [^113mkwj1] <br/> - Iodine deficiency [^notfound] <br/> - Thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy [^116o1x3e] <br/> - Congenital hypothyroidism [^112u3Tis] <br/> - Medications (e.g. amiodarone, lithium, interferon-alpha) [^113XpJMe] |
| Central hypothyroidism | - Pituitary or hypothalamic disease (e.g. tumors, infiltrative diseases, radiation) [^116Rq9QT] <br/> - Sheehan's syndrome <br/> - Traumatic brain injury [^notfound] |
| Assay interference | - Heterophilic antibodies [^114fiaqB] <br/> - Biotin supplementation [^115uotdx] <br/> - Analytical errors [^112jhSYv] |

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough clinical evaluation should include:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, cognitive impairment, depression, menstrual irregularities [^notfound].

- **Signs**: Bradycardia, delayed reflexes, periorbital edema, goiter, dry skin, hair thinning [^notfound].

- **Medication history**: Amiodarone, lithium, interferon-alpha, dopamine agonists, glucocorticoids [^1141dvkY] [^112HV1n7].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Confirm the diagnosis and guide management with the following tests:

- **Repeat TSH and free T4**: Confirm persistent elevation of TSH and low free T4 [^116XK1nC].

- **Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies**: Assess for autoimmune thyroiditis [^113n1g4j].

- **Total or free T3**: Generally not necessary unless hyperthyroidism is suspected [^117W8kM1].

- **CBC, lipid profile, and renal function tests**: Evaluate for associated abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment with **levothyroxine** is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, cognitive impairment, depression, menstrual irregularities [^112VJzEn].

- **TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L**: Even if asymptomatic, due to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to overt hypothyroidism [^1151QfPg].

- **Pregnancy or planning pregnancy**: TSH > 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, TSH > 3.0 mIU/L in the second and third trimesters [^notfound].

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism with positive anti-TPO antibodies**: Increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism [^1151QfPg].

---

## Treatment and monitoring

- **Initial dose**: 1.6 mcg/kg/day, adjusted based on age, weight, cardiovascular status, and comorbidities [^1113UfcP].

- **Monitoring**: Measure TSH every 6–8 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment until stable, then annually [^notfound].

- **Target TSH**: 0.5–2.5 mIU/L, individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities [^notfound].

- **Adverse effects**: Overtreatment may cause atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and anxiety [^111yYVBa].

---

## Special considerations

- **Central hypothyroidism**: Treat with levothyroxine, targeting free T4 rather than TSH [^112GQShE].

- **Elderly patients**: Start low and titrate slowly to avoid cardiovascular complications [^notfound].

- **Pregnancy**: Increase levothyroxine dose by 30–50% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed [^notfound].

---

High TSH with low free T4 indicates **overt primary hypothyroidism**, most commonly due to autoimmune thyroiditis. Confirm with repeat testing and anti-TPO antibodies, then initiate **levothyroxine** in symptomatic patients, those with **TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L**, or in pregnancy. Monitor TSH regularly and adjust therapy to maintain euthyroidism.

## References

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to measure serum free T4 and TSH for the evaluation of CeH. Consider confirming CeH in case of a free T4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^117NV6Ub]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect CeH in patients with low serum concentrations of free T4 and slightly elevated TSH (< 10 mU/L, or inappropriately lower than expected on the basis of the hypothyroid state).

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1129gwkb]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QehcY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PVhnp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115jXbXK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113jZXuL]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that chronic disease, frequent in older adults, could be associated with non-thyroidal illness (NTI) and in severe cases may result in decreased fT4, thus generating false positives. Yet, TSH elevations are often found in the recovery phase after NTI mimicking SCHT.

Alternatively, the PPV of current screening for thyroid dysfunction could be improved by elevation of the TSH cutoff value. Several other authors have proposed this approach. However, with this strategy (model 2), individuals with hypothyroidism and a limited elevation of TSH would be missed. Furthermore, in our population the increase in PPV was only limited compared with the fT4-based strategy.

Some limitations have to be acknowledged. Firstly, due to the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot exclude that individuals included in the study may have had a history of thyroid disease, which we could not filter from the available laboratory data, for example in cases where patients have visited other laboratories for checkups. Second, the study group was relatively small. Further prospective studies with sufficient power are needed to validate our findings. Third, the determination of optimal cutoff values for TSH and fT4 (which currently vary significantly within geographical areas and within method groups) should also be investigated in follow-up studies. Yet, this is hampered by the fact that a gold standard test for hypothyroidism is lacking, the combination of test results from two tests, fT4 and TSH, determines the diagnosis.

In conclusion, our results suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction in older individuals in primary care can be improved by screening based on fT4 instead of TSH or by adjusting the TSH cutoff value. Adjustment of the screening strategy may be of interest to health policy makers because of potential cost reduction. From a patient's perspective, medical concerns and unnecessary biochemical follow up might be reduced by circumventing the diagnosis SCHT.

After lobectomy for TA, serum calcium levels do not need to be obtained and calcium and calcitriol supplements do not need to be administered. Thyroid hormone replacement is required in about 15%–20% of patients following thyroid lobectomy. TSH levels may remain in the high normal range for 3–6 months; therefore, continued monitoring for 4–6 months postoperatively is reasonable.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^117W8kM1]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

True Biochemical Hyperthyroidism With Nonsuppressed TSH

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4

Thyroxine therapy, including with poor compliance

Variable compliance with T4 therapy in hypothyroidism can cause a biochemical pattern of normal or elevated FT4 and raised TSH concentrations. In this context, a seemingly appropriate increase in thyroxine dosage (perhaps to a supraphysiological level) can normalize TSH levels but be associated with concomitantly elevated circulating THs, raising the possibility of underlying RTHβ. Distinguishing this clinical situation from true coincidence of RTHβ with autoimmune hypothyroidism (which occurs rarely), is discussed further below.

Separate to this, it is also recognized that a subset of hypothyroid patients, compliant with thyroxine therapy in physiological dosage, can exhibit raised circulating FT4 but normal FT3 and TSH concentrations. This phenomenon has been attributed to diminished activity of type 2 deiodinase, reducing the generation of T3 (from its T4 precursor) that is available to inhibit pituitary TSH secretion.

Deficiency of selenocysteine-containing proteins, including deiodinase enzymes

Over 25 human proteins, including the thyroid deiodinase enzymes, contain the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). The incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins during their translation is dependent on a unique cellular pathway that includes its own transfer RNA (Sec-tRNA (Ser)Sec, encoded by TRU-TCA1–1) and a protein (SECIS binding protein 2, encoded by SECISBP2), which binds a specific sequence (SElenium Cysteine Insertion Sequence [SECIS]) located in the 3′-untranslated region of all selenoprotein mRNAs. Biallelic mutations in SECISBP2 cause a rare multisystem disorder, often presenting in childhood with growth retardation and developmental delay. Diminished activity of deiodinase enzymes and low circulating selenoproteins cause a distinctive biochemical signature of raised FT4, normal or low FT3, normal or raised TSH, elevated reverse T3 and low circulating selenium concentrations in all patients (Table 4); this biochemical pattern has also been documented in 2 patients with selenoprotein deficiency due to a homozygous nucleotide substitution in TRU-TCA1–1.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^1157Sc4o]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Screening for thyroid dysfunction is frequently performed in older individuals presenting with fatigue and general malaise to exclude thyroid disease. The diagnosis of thyroid disease is largely biochemical. Hence, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) cutoff values, which vary significantly between laboratories, are important determinants of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. Current screening guidelines for thyroid dysfunction in primary care suggest a TSH assay followed by analysis of fT4, if TSH results are outside the reference interval (reflex testing). TSH is a sensitive marker. Linear changes in fT4 lead to exponential changes in TSH. Hence, TSH has traditionally been the first choice screening test.

A consistently elevated TSH with an fT4 within the reference range results in the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT). Although associations between SCHT and some areas of medicine such as cardio-renal metabolic disease are still under investigation, in older persons (65 years and over) SCHT is generally believed not to be associated with quality of life, symptom burden, physical or cognitive functioning, other diseases or mortality. Additionally, multiple studies have shown that older adults with SCHT do not benefit from levothyroxine supplementation. Still, in daily practice, the diagnosis SCHT leads to additional monitoring, unnecessary treatment and increased patient concerns.

Therefore, fT4-based screening to identify clinical thyroid disease would potentially be a more efficient screening strategy for older adults with possible symptoms of thyroid disease. This strategy could reduce costs and patient concerns. Several reports dating from the '80's and '90's have already suggested such a testing algorithm. Alternatively, TSH decision limits could be adjusted to reduce unnecessary reflex testing and thus reduce unwarranted monitoring.

In this retrospective study we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction in older adults in primary care compared with TSH-based screening. Furthermore, the alternative approach of elevating TSH decision limits was investigated in parallel.

Congenital hypothyroidism — evidence context for treatment thresholds: L‑T4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT4 or TT4 levels are low; the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/l, supporting immediate treatment above this value; given the critical period from birth to the age of 3 years, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/l with monitoring and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located; many, but not all, patients have permanent disease particularly when early TSH is high (e.g., > 100 mU/l) with normal FT4; families should be informed this is a 'gray area' and that many clinicians would advise 'playing safe' and treating during early childhood.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^111YjdBN]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT) is defined as a consistently elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with a free T4 (fT4) within the reference range. This diagnosis may lead to additional monitoring, levothyroxine therapy and increased patient concerns, despite lack of evidence of treatment benefit in older adults. In order to avoid this diagnosis, we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction, in older adults in primary care and compared it with TSH-based screening. Individuals aged > 65years in primary care were selected for this retrospective study when both TSH and fT4 were individually requested irrespective of the TSH value. Exclusion criteria were C-reactive protein > 10 mg/l or a history of thyroid hormone monitoring in the previous year. Screening based on fT4 instead of TSH decreased reflex testing from 23.8% to 11.2%. The positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism increased from 17.3% to 52.2%. The negative predictive value was 96.1% with TSH-based screening versus 97.8% with fT4-based screening. Elevation of the TSH cutoff value from 4.2 to 6.5 mU/l resulted in a reflex test percentage of 12.5% and a PPV of 31.0%. Our results suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction in older individuals in primary care can be improved by screening based on fT4 instead of TSH or by adjusting the TSH cutoff value. Adjustment of the screening strategy may be of interest to health policy makers because of potential cost reduction. From a patient perspective, medical concerns and unnecessary biochemical follow-up might be reduced by circumventing the diagnosis SCHT.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112GQShE]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### The "slightly" abnormal thyroid test: what is the pediatrician to do? [^116JxCS5]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disorders are common in pediatrics. Tests of thyroid function are widely available and frequently ordered in the pediatric healthcare setting. This is sometimes driven by common signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. All too often, it is driven by patients and their parents requesting thyroid tests for nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, obesity or family history of thyroid disease. The decision to order thyroid tests, as well as which test(s) of thyroid function to order, deserves careful thought rather than a reflexive "thyroid panel" for every patient. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most appropriate test of thyroid function when screening a pediatric or adolescent for thyroid disorders. Adding more tests only increases the likelihood that a minor (and often insignificant) abnormality will be found. These incidental abnormalities can create anxiety for the parent and child, and usually results in additional testing, referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, and further expense. This review will aim to guide the pediatric primary care provider on the choice of appropriate screening test(s) for acquired thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents, as well as the proper interpretation of the test(s). Emphasis will be placed on the "slightly" abnormal thyroid screening test. Specific thyroid tests to be reviewed include TSH, (free) T4, (free) T3, and thyroid antibodies. Finally, this review will aim to guide decisions on follow-up, additional testing, and reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Congenital hypothyroidism, including abnormalities on state newborn screening, will not be discussed.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^111qM5wU]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT) is defined as a consistently elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with a free T4 (fT4) within the reference range. This diagnosis may lead to additional monitoring, levothyroxine therapy and increased patient concerns, despite lack of evidence of treatment benefit in older adults. In order to avoid this diagnosis, we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction, in older adults in primary care and compared it with TSH-based screening.

Individuals aged > 65years in primary care were selected for this retrospective study when both TSH and fT4 were individually requested irrespective of the TSH value. Exclusion criteria were C-reactive protein > 10 mg/l or a history of thyroid hormone monitoring in the previous year.

Screening based on fT4 instead of TSH decreased reflex testing from 23.8% to 11.2%. The positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism increased from 17.3% to 52.2%. The negative predictive value was 96.1% with TSH-based screening versus 97.8% with fT4-based screening. Elevation of the TSH cutoff value from 4.2 to 6.5 mU/l resulted in a reflex test percentage of 12.5% and a PPV of 31.0%.

Our results suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction in older individuals in primary care can be improved by screening based on fT4 instead of TSH or by adjusting the TSH cutoff value. Adjustment of the screening strategy may be of interest to health policy makers because of potential cost reduction. From a patient perspective, medical concerns and unnecessary biochemical follow-up might be reduced by circumventing the diagnosis SCHT.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^111hctbK]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Although age specific TSH targets may be considered, especially in the context of high cardiovascular risk, this strategy is based on the findings of studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid people. However, patients with hypothyroidism need a higher concentration of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH concentration compared with euthyroid controls. Consequently, a hypothyroid patient receiving thyroid replacement therapy and a euthyroid patient with comparable TSH concentrations are not expected to have comparable circulating free thyroxine concentrations. The same is true of free triiodothyronine concentrations in patients who have had total thyroidectomy. Therefore, any extrapolations on the association between optimal TSH concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy based on studies in euthyroid patients should be treated with caution, as serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations (relevant to cardiovascular physiology) may differ significantly between the two groups.

Moreover, in primary studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid patients, and in the related meta-analyses and reviews, thyroid function testing was done only at baseline. The potential therefore exists for misclassification bias in all estimates to date as a result of established and anticipated changes in thyroid hormone production over the life course of a patient, as well as instances of transient thyroid dysfunction (such as non-thyroidal illness or following the hyperthyroid phase of a painless thyroiditis). A person classified as euthyroid at baseline might go on to develop hypothyroidism, overt or subclinical, whereas those classified as subclinically hypothyroid might be found to be euthyroid on follow-up thyroid function testing.

Similar limitations affect studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and risk of fracture, and whether variation in TSH concentration within normal limits may significantly affect the skeleton or whether any effect is insignificant in clinical terms (fracture risk remains unaffected) remains unclear. This is further challenged by evidence suggesting that free thyroxine concentrations are the main driver of the above clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to explore whether TSH concentration is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mortality, and fractures in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. We treated TSH as a time varying covariate to account for variation in TSH concentration over time within individuals.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Central hypothyroidism in adults: better understanding for better care [^111AW8qM]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare cause of hypothyroidism generally related to a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or arising as an iatrogenic complication. In adults, CH may be secondary to quantitative and/or qualitative alterations in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. The disease is difficult to diagnose clinically because it lacks specific clinical signs and these may be masked by other anterior pituitary hormone secretion deficiencies. In patients with long-standing and marked CH, a diagnosis may be made based on low free T4 levels and normal, low or moderately increased TSH levels. In patients with early-stage or moderate CH, exploration of the circadian TSH cycle, determination of TSH response after a TRH test or recombinant TSH injection, estimation of TSH index, or evaluation of peripheral indexes of thyroid hormone metabolism may be required to establish a diagnosis. Regarding treatment, patients should receive levothyroxine replacement therapy, but hormone objectives during follow-up need to be precisely determined in order to reduce cardiovascular risks and to improve the quality of life of patients.

The biochemical assessment of thyroid function involves measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4) level and sometimes triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Interpretation should be made based on local laboratory reference ranges, and with awareness of local assay limitations. Limitations of free T3 assays include a lack of validation and robustness, when compared with free T4 assays. The measurement of total T3 is therefore preferred to free T3 in most settings. Specific assays for thyroid hormones and TSH may be susceptible to biotin interference, thereby leading to increased thyroid hormone levels and/or decreased TSH levels measured, depending on the assay used. To avoid biotin interference in susceptible assays, patients should be advised to stop biotin for a minimum of 72 hours prior to blood collection. Certain biomarkers such as antithyroid antibodies have been shown to be associated with higher risk of developing thyroid irAEs. The prevalence of baseline positivity of antithyroid antibodies such as anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, however, is high in the general population. As the study of biomarkers in thyroid irAEs remains an evolving field at present, the role of measurement of antithyroid antibodies in the diagnosis of thyroid irAEs is currently unknown.

Given the high incidence of thyroid irAEs, a proactive screening approach is recommended for the diagnosis of ir-thyroiditis. Most guidelines suggest assessing thyroid function at baseline and subsequently every 4–6 weeks, or with each cycle of ICI treatment. The frequency of testing should be tailored to the individual patient's clinical course. For example, patients in the thyrotoxic phase of ir-thyroiditis may require more frequent monitoring of both clinical symptoms and TFT, whereas those with established ir-thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, on a stable dose of thyroid hormone replacement months into ICI treatment, may be considered for less frequent monitoring.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of CeH by the combined findings of serum free T4 concentrations below the LLN and inappropriately low/normal TSH concentrations on at least 2 separate determinations, and after exclusion of other conditions, including:

- non-thyroidal illness

- isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia (interpret in the context of trimester-specific free T4 reference ranges for pregnant patients)

- levothyroxine withdrawal syndrome

- recovery from thyrotoxicosis

- technical assay problems or interference, or defects in TBG (TBG defects in case of total T4 determination or calculation of free T4 index)

- drugs reducing TSH secretion (corticosteroids, dopamine, cocaine, anticonvulsants or antipsychotics, metformin)

- premature birth (delayed TSH rise in hypothyroid infants)

- allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (MCT8 mutations)

- THRA mutations (RTHα)

- TSHβ mutations with conserved bioactivity but lost immunoreactivity of circulating TSH.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

Summary

When no definitive diagnosis of permanent CH was made in the first weeks or months of life, then re-evaluation of the HPT axis after the age of 2 to 3 years is indicated, particularly in children with a GIS, and in those with presumed isolated central CH (1/++0).
For a precise diagnosis, LT4 treatment should be phased out over a 4 to 6 weeks period or just stopped, and full re-evaluation should be carried out after 4 weeks, consisting of (at least) fT4 and TSH measurement.
If primary hypothyroidism is confirmed (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L), consider thyroid imaging and, if possible, genetic testing; if central CH is likely (fT4 below the lower limit of the reference interval in combination with a low normal of only mildly elevated TSH), consider evaluating the other anterior pituitary functions and genetic testing.
If TSH is above the upper limit of the reference interval but < 10 mU/L (primary CH) or fT4 just above the lower limit of the reference interval (central CH), then continue withdrawal and retest in another 3 to 4 weeks (1/++0).
If a child with no permanent CH diagnosis and a GIS requires an LT4 dose < 3 μg/kg per day at the age of 6 months, then re-evaluation can be done already at that time (1/++0).
We recommend avoiding iodine as an antiseptic during peri- and neonatal period, as it can cause transient CH (1/++0).

Recommendations about thyroid screening, however, have been inconsistent. Currently, no organizations recommend routine universal screening. For example, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. 4) or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed. The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T 4 level of 6 or 7 μg per dL, although not outside the normal range of 4. 5 to
12.

5 μg per dL, may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL and, thus, is low for this particular patient. Dry skin, cold intolerance and easy fatigability were significantly more common in the patients with raised TSH levels, and these symptoms improved after treatment with thyroid hormone. In another study 11 of 69 female patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, a clinical index based on symptoms and physical signs was shown to be more abnormal in patients with higher TSH levels, even though all patients had normal serum levels of T 4 and free T 4. These studies suggest that some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do indeed have clinical manifestations of mild thyroid failure. A common error is the failure to decrease the levothyroxine dosage if the TSH level is suppressed below the normal range, which may occur without the free T 4 level rising above normal.

This state is considered to represent "subclinical hyperthyroidism, " and although formerly it was thought to be harmless, it is now believed to be associated with undesired effects on bone density and cardiac function, and to be a possible cause of neuropsychologic symptoms and other mild manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 16, 17.

4) and total or free triiodothyronine levels. 1 Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be divided into two categories: low but detectable TSH and less than 0. 1 mIU per L. 8 Iodine-deficient areas have a higher prevalence of thyroid autonomy. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey evaluated TSH, free T 4, and thyroid antibody levels in a sample population older than 12 years that represented the geographic and ethnic distribution of the U. S. population. 9 The prevalence of TSH levels less than 0. 1 mIU per L was
0. 7%, whereas 1. 8% had levels less than
0. 4 mIU per L. 4 and T 3 levels tend to be lower in persons with these conditions, whereas persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have free T 4 and T 3 levels in the mid to high reference range.

Reassessment of TSH, free T 3, and free T 4 levels is appropriate after two to four months to evaluate whether low TSH is persistent and whether subclinical thyroid disease has progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. A suggested diagnostic approach is outlined in Figure 1.
2. 17 A meta-analysis of five prospective cohort studies evaluating a total of 8, 711 participants showed an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in those with TSH levels less than
0. 1 mIU per L and 0. 1 to
0. 44 mIU per L, 4 indicating that the risk of atrial fibrillation inversely correlates with TSH levels. HEART FAILURE A pooled analysis of six prospective cohort studies that included 25, 390 participants with a mean follow-up of 10 years found that those with TSH levels less than 0. 1 mIU per L had a higher risk of heart failure than euthyroid participants.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 The upper-end normal range is from 4. 0 to
4. 5 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 FT 4 level is used to distinguish clinical from subclinical hypothyroidism. Routinely evaluating total T 3, total T 4, or FT 3 levels is not indicated. If the FT 4 level is normal, further thyroid or pituitary evaluation is unnecessary. If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome |-| If the TSH level is low, hyperthyroidism is possible. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained.

A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). Table 1 lists other causes. 1–4 An elevated FT 4 level may suggest a TSH-secreting tumor, and referral to endocrinology is warranted. An FT 4 level within the reference range indicates subclinical hypothyroidism. Rare other causes include adrenal insufficiency, drugs, post-nonthyroidal illness, or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. Most adults older than 30 years with elevated TSH but normal FT 4 levels do not benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and 60% normalize within five years.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Unnecessary levothyroxine treatment of subclinical disease may lead to increased fractures and cardiac arrhythmias. 6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided.

For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.
1. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels.

TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks. 9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.
