## Question

what are the primary treatment measures for severe COVID19 pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the primary treatment measures for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "severe" disease and classify the immunocompromised population. Then, I should verify the core principle of timing relative to viral and inflammatory phases. Next, I will examine antiviral therapy, especially remdesivir, and whether to extend its use beyond typical oxygenation thresholds in immunocompromised hosts. After that, I need to review immunomodulatory therapy, starting with corticosteroids, then IL-6 inhibition and JAK inhibition, and finally consider infliximab or abatacept when first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated. I will then assess convalescent plasma in the immunocompromised context, both inpatient and outpatient. Finally, I should integrate supportive care, monitoring, and special considerations such as prolonged viral shedding and secondary infections, and close with a concise synthesis of the primary measures anchored to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework and the immunocompromised population, because treatment hinges on both. Severe COVID-19 is generally defined as SpO2 less than 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, while critical illness involves high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, and this stratification guides therapy selection and timing [^115YEv67]. Immunocompromised states include primary immunodeficiencies, active malignancy or within one year of therapy, HIV with CD4 less than 200, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation within one year, prolonged high-dose corticosteroids, and biologic or other immunosuppressive agents, recognizing that risk exists on a continuum and evolves with variants and prior immunity [^116ABKeJ] [^117L54Bb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before anchoring the therapeutic principle. The early phase is dominated by high viral load and limited adaptive immunity, so antivirals are most effective when started within about 5 to 7 days of symptom onset, whereas later phases reflect hyperinflammation where immunomodulators confer benefit; in immunocompromised patients, prolonged viral replication may extend the window for antiviral benefit, but I should verify that against guideline nuance before assuming a longer window [^111UMYt3] [^115h88ti].

> I will now examine antiviral therapy, and remdesivir is the key agent here. Wait, let me verify the timing and scope in immunocompromised hosts. Standard guidance supports remdesivir early in disease, but IDSA notes that immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral replication may still benefit beyond the usual SpO2 threshold or even after intubation, acknowledging the evidence gap and the need for more data on viral load–guided use; nonetheless, real-world comparative effectiveness studies show reduced inpatient mortality when remdesivir is initiated promptly in immunocompromised patients, supporting early use even if the exact window is extended in some cases [^115h88ti] [^113wVR65] [^1112X9tT]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: if the patient is within 7 to 10 days of symptom onset or has documented ongoing viral replication, remdesivir remains reasonable despite higher oxygen requirements, recognizing the uncertainty and documenting the rationale [^115h88ti].

> Next, I should review immunomodulatory therapy, starting with corticosteroids, because this is foundational in severe disease. I need to ensure I apply the right population and dose. For hospitalized adults with severe or critical COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone reduces mortality and is recommended by IDSA and WHO; typical dosing is 6 mg IV or orally daily for up to 10 days or until discharge, with consideration of equivalent steroid regimens if dexamethasone is unavailable, and pediatric extrapolation is commonly practiced despite adult-focused trials [^114cMAhX] [^1123TrBf]. But wait, what if the patient is not hypoxemic? Steroids are not indicated in mild disease and may be harmful, so I should avoid jumping to steroids in the absence of oxygen requirement [^1122kKZg].

> I will now examine IL-6 pathway blockade, and tocilizumab is the agent with the most consistent signal in severe and critical illness. Let me verify the timing and eligibility. IDSA suggests tocilizumab for hospitalized adults with severe or critical COVID-19, particularly when CRP is at least 75 mg/L or there is rapid respiratory deterioration, and to give it alongside corticosteroids; sarilumab can be considered if tocilizumab is unavailable, acknowledging supply constraints and similar mechanism [^111XjAqY]. Hold on, I should confirm that immunocompromised patients were included in the pivotal trials; while subgroup data are limited, the overall recommendation applies and should be individualized to infection risk and concomitant immunosuppression [^111XjAqY].

> Next, I should review JAK inhibition, and baricitinib is the preferred agent here. Let me check the evidence and combinations. IDSA suggests baricitinib in addition to standard care for severe COVID-19, and if corticosteroids cannot be used, baricitinib with remdesivir is suggested rather than remdesivir alone; typical dosing is 4 mg daily for up to 14 days or until discharge, and benefits in mechanically ventilated patients are less certain, so I should be cautious about expectations in the critical care stratum [^115sUweG] [^116Akcwq] [^116iopH4]. I should double-check for drug interactions and thrombotic risk, and ensure VTE prophylaxis is in place when using JAK inhibition in this context [^112Y4aVT].

> But wait, what if baricitinib and tocilizumab are unavailable or contraindicated? I need to consider second-line immunomodulators. IDSA 2025 focused updates suggest infliximab or abatacept as conditional options for severe or critical COVID-19 in adults already receiving systemic glucocorticoids when baricitinib and tocilizumab are not available, with low certainty of evidence and explicit acknowledgment of trial exclusions of immunocompromised patients, so shared decision-making and careful infection surveillance are essential [^112zG2Ab] [^11534g8P] [^114cnNpM] [^112eK2Aw]. Let me verify that these are truly second-line and not substitutes for first-line agents; yes, guidelines position them as alternatives when first-line immunomodulators are inaccessible [^112zG2Ab].

> I should also review tofacitinib, because it appears in IDSA recommendations for a specific subgroup. For hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 who are not on invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, IDSA suggests tofacitinib rather than no tofacitinib, with the caveat to provide at least prophylactic-dose anticoagulation and to avoid combining with IL-6 inhibitors; importantly, STOP-COVID did not include immunocompromised patients, so extrapolation requires caution and individualized risk assessment [^112Y4aVT] [^11438BVP]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not first-line in critical illness; the signal is strongest in severe, noncritical patients, aligning with the conditional recommendation [^112Y4aVT].

> Now, convalescent plasma deserves careful, context-specific consideration in immunocompromised patients. Initially, I thought convalescent plasma might be broadly beneficial in hospitalized immunocompromised patients, but wait, I should verify the latest guidance. IDSA advises against routine use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized immunocompromised patients due to very low certainty of benefit, while allowing that in ambulatory immunocompromised patients with mild to moderate disease who have no other options, FDA-qualified high-titer plasma within 8 days of symptom onset may be considered; a recent meta-analysis suggests potential benefit in immunocompromised hosts, but heterogeneity and low quality temper confidence, so use should be selective and ideally in consultation with specialists [^112yatSn] [^1138cywb] [^113dkRuU] [^115V2CiM]. I need to ensure that if considered, plasma is high titer and matched to circulating variants, and that other approved therapies have been attempted or are unavailable [^1122kKZg].

> Next, I should review supportive care, because it is foundational and often determines outcomes. I need to ensure guideline-concordant oxygenation targets, lung-protective ventilation when indicated, prone positioning for severe ARDS, and standard critical care protocols for sepsis and shock, while avoiding routine therapeutic anticoagulation beyond prophylaxis unless another indication exists. IDSA and WHO emphasize supportive care and appropriate VTE prophylaxis, and IDSA advises against routine colchicine in hospitalized patients [^1116bpoF]. Let me double-check antibiotic stewardship. Procalcitonin has limited utility to drive discontinuation in COVID-19, and early empiric antibiotics should be de-escalated promptly if bacterial infection is not supported, given risks of superinfection and resistance [^114xpjTE].

> I will now examine special considerations unique to immunocompromised hosts. Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication and intrahost viral evolution are well described, so I should maintain a low threshold to extend antiviral therapy or consider repeat courses when clinical and virologic trajectories lag, balancing risks and benefits and documenting rationale; IDSA highlights this as a knowledge gap and supports individualized decisions in the setting of uncontrolled viral replication [^115h88ti] [^116cUUAg]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply indefinite therapy; decisions should be guided by serial clinical assessments, oxygen needs, and, when available, viral markers, recognizing the absence of definitive protocols [^115h88ti].

> Let me synthesize the primary treatment measures succinctly. For severe COVID-19 pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient, the core interventions are prompt initiation of remdesivir when feasible even if outside the conventional early window in the setting of ongoing viral replication, dexamethasone for those requiring supplemental oxygen, and escalation to IL-6 or JAK inhibition with tocilizumab or baricitinib according to severity, inflammatory markers, and availability, with infliximab or abatacept as conditional second-line options when first-line immunomodulators are not available. Convalescent plasma is not routine in hospitalized patients but may be considered in select ambulatory immunocompromised patients without other options, and all of this rests on meticulous supportive care and infection-prevention practices [^115h88ti] [^114cMAhX] [^115sUweG] [^111XjAqY] [^112zG2Ab] [^1138cywb]. I should confirm that this synthesis aligns with IDSA's living guidance and the most recent focused updates. Yes, these recommendations reflect the current IDSA stance and the evolving evidence base [^111tirQm] [^111oxYHC].

For severe COVID-19 pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, the primary treatment measures are: **dexamethasone 6 mg IV/PO daily for up to 10 days** [^114cMAhX] if oxygen is required, plus **remdesivir for 5–10 days** [^115h88ti] even if > 7 days have elapsed since symptom onset, as immunocompromised patients may have prolonged viral replication [^116cUUAg]. Add **tocilizumab or baricitinib** [^115sUweG] if rapid respiratory deterioration or elevated inflammatory markers occur, and use **prophylactic-dose anticoagulation** unless contraindicated. Avoid routine convalescent plasma [^112yatSn] and monitor closely for secondary infections and drug interactions.

---

## Antiviral therapy

### Remdesivir

- **Indication**: Recommended for immunocompromised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, even if > 7 days have elapsed since symptom onset, due to prolonged viral replication [^115h88ti] [^116cUUAg].
- **Dosage**: 200 mg IV on day 1, then 100 mg IV daily for 5–10 days, based on clinical response and severity.
- **Evidence**: Observational data suggest reduced mortality in immunocompromised patients when remdesivir is initiated promptly [^1112X9tT].

---

## Immunomodulatory therapy

### Corticosteroids

Use **dexamethasone** 6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days or until discharge for patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation [^115sUweG]. Evidence from multiple RCTs and guidelines supports mortality benefit in severe COVID-19 [^117AXWMs].

---

### Additional immunomodulators

- **Tocilizumab**: Consider in patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and elevated inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP ≥ 75 mg/L) [^111XjAqY].
- **Baricitinib**: Alternative immunomodulator, particularly when tocilizumab is unavailable or contraindicated [^115sUweG].
- **Infliximab or abatacept**: Consider in severe or critical cases when first-line immunomodulators are unavailable or contraindicated [^112zG2Ab] [^114cnNpM].

---

## Anticoagulation

Use **prophylactic-dose anticoagulation** (e.g. enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily) unless contraindicated, to reduce thrombotic complications [^notfound].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care includes **oxygen therapy** — provide supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94% and escalate to high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation as needed [^notfound] — and **monitoring for complications**, including secondary bacterial or fungal infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction [^111m9dL5].

---

## Special considerations in immunocompromised patients

- **Prolonged viral shedding**: Immunocompromised patients may have prolonged viral replication, necessitating extended antiviral therapy and isolation precautions [^116cUUAg].
- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections requires vigilant monitoring and early intervention [^111m9dL5].
- **Drug interactions**: Careful review of immunosuppressive medications and potential drug interactions is essential [^notfound].

---

## Treatments to avoid or use cautiously

Avoid **routine convalescent plasma**; it is not recommended due to limited evidence and potential risks [^112yatSn] [^1138cywb]. Use **hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ivermectin** cautiously, as they are not recommended outside clinical trials [^112EzLDp] [^1122kKZg].

## Summary of primary treatment measures

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dexamethasone | Severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen | 6 mg IV/PO daily ≤ 10 days | High |
| Remdesivir | Severe COVID-19 in immunocompromised | 200 mg day 1, then 100 mg daily 5–10 days | Moderate |
| Tocilizumab | Rapid deterioration, elevated CRP | 8 mg/kg IV once | Moderate |
| Baricitinib | Alternative immunomodulator | 4 mg PO daily ≤ 14 days | Moderate |
| Prophylactic anticoagulation | All hospitalized patients | Per protocol | High |

---

The primary treatment measures for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in immunocompromised patients include **dexamethasone, remdesivir, and supportive care**, with consideration of additional immunomodulators based on clinical response and inflammatory markers.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older — is addressed as follows: In moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised because they have the highest risk of inadequate immune response and progression to severe disease, while the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years, who have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, as reflected by lower rates of hospitalization. Resources note that as the pandemic evolves, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge with varying susceptibility to available anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; for current information, please refer to the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker (Summary of Variant Surveillance), and information on pemivibart is included in the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Pemgarda).

### Compassionate use of REGEN-COV® in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and immunodeficiency-associated antibody disorders [^115ax6aG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first emerged in 2019, and has led to a global pandemic. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of developing a range of respiratory conditions, from mild to severe symptoms, and sometimes fatal illness. Patients with either primary or secondary immunodeficiency-associated antibody disorders who have an inherited or acquired inability to produce antibodies against infective agents have a high risk of suffering from prolonged or persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, increasing their morbidity and mortality risk. These patients are also likely to show lack of, or significantly less effective, protective immune responses to vaccines, and may have to rely on alternate prevention and treatment regimes.

The treatment of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 using convalescent plasma is controversial due to a lack of specificity and variable content of potent neutralizing antibodies. In February 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a revision of the Emergency Use Authorization for COVID-19 convalescent plasma, for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who have impaired humoral immunity and cannot produce an adequate antibody response. However, results from 3 small randomized controlled trials in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 showed no significant differences in improved clinical outcomes between the convalescent plasma-treated and placebo groups.

### The role of immunomodulatory medications in the treatment of COVID-19 [^117AXWMs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Given the role of inflammation in severe forms of COVID-19, glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been assessed as potential COVID-19 therapies.

Recent Findings

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that glucocorticoids reduce mortality in severe COVID-19. RCTs of DMARDs have shown mixed results varying on intervention and inclusion criteria. DMARDs, including colchicine or biologic agents, may improve COVID-19 outcomes in specific patient populations.

Summary

Glucocorticoids are an effective treatment for the management of severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to better define the patient populations who could benefit from DMARD use, as well as provide guidance regarding the timing of these interventions.

### 2025 clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on the treatment and management of COVID-19: pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis, vilobelimab for critical illness, and abatacept or infliximab for severe or critical illness [^114BhYSD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — pemivibart for pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised persons: In moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years or older at risk for progression to severe COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests pre-exposure prophylaxis with pemivibart when predominant regional variants are susceptible to the agent (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised because they have the highest risk of inadequate immune response and progression to severe disease, and the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years, who have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, as reflected by lower rates of hospitalization. As the evidence is based on immunobridging and circulating variant susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation, and in addition to immunobridging data, results from the phase 3 CANOPY trial are now available showing comparable effect estimates; although the certainty of the evidence may be affected by this newer data, the guideline panel concluded that the direction and strength of the recommendation would not change.

Baricitinib — randomized controlled trials in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 are summarized as follows: Two randomized controlled trials compared baricitinib (4 mg daily dose up to 14 days) to placebo in hospitalized adults, including COV-BARRIER, which enrolled severe COVID classified by NIAID OS levels 4, 5, or 6 (4 – hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 5 – hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 6 – hospitalized, receiving non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices) while critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients (OS7) were excluded; COV-BARRIER randomization was stratified by disease severity, age, region, and use of corticosteroids, and participants had ≥ 1 elevated inflammatory marker and received standard of care with corticosteroids in 79% and/or antivirals (e.g., remdesivir in 18.9%). The RECOVERY trial included hospitalized patients with approximately 70% receiving supplemental oxygen, 25% non-invasive ventilation, and 3% invasive ventilation, and standard of care in both arms included corticosteroids in approximately 95% and/or antivirals (e.g., remdesivir in 20%). An additional exploratory trial in critically ill (OS-7) patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation reported outcomes including mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization, and serious adverse events.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

### Your outpatient has coronavirus disease 2019: what are the treatment options in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant climate? [^1135gyvf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The evolving COVID-19 pandemic continues to have the highest impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, persons with immunocompromising conditions, and incompletely vaccinated patients. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutations have resulted in evasion of previously effective monoclonal antibody therapies, available oral and intravenous antiviral therapies maintain activity and serve as key tools to reduce COVID-19 morbidity. Among high-risk individuals, antiviral drug access and patient profile determine optimal antiviral selection. These therapies serve as a complement to key ongoing nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce viral circulation in the community and vaccination strategies that maximize immunoprotection.

Convalescent plasma — ambulatory mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk with no other options: Among ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who have no other treatment options, the IDSA guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset rather than no high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Remarks include that in the United States, FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) only authorizes use in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment; that patients who are not immunocompromised and who place a low value on the uncertain benefits and a high value on avoiding possible adverse events would reasonably decline convalescent plasma; and that other options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir, with patient-specific factors and logistical challenges guiding choice of agent, and that data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting.

Pemivibart PrEP — conditional recommendation and research needs: The guideline panel issued a conditional recommendation for PrEP with pemivibart in moderately or severely immunocompromised individuals, but due to limited clinical evidence the resulting net benefit remains unknown for adults and may be clarified when final randomized trial evidence is available, and it will remain unknown for patients aged 12 to 17 years since they were not included in the trial. Detailed data on the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis specifically in immunocompromised individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccines are needed, and additional data regarding safety, serum neutralizing against emerging variants, clinical efficacy, and pharmacoeconomic analyses are needed.

Pemivibart — benefit, risk, dosing, and timing per FDA EUA are described as follows: The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised, and the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years. Patients who place a higher value on potential harms, specifically, the observed 0.6% risk of anaphylaxis, and a lower value on the uncertain benefits of prevention of severe COVID-19 would reasonably decline pemivibart. Per the FDA EUA, pemivibart is authorized to be given at 4,500 mg IV every 3 months, and in individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, pemivibart should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. As the evidence is based on immunobridging and circulating variant susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — tofacitinib for severe **COVID-19 not on mechanical ventilation: Among hospitalized adults with severe **COVID-19 but not on non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, the IDSA panel suggests tofacitinib rather than no tofacitinib (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Tofacitinib appears to demonstrate the most benefit in those with severe COVID-19 on supplemental or high-flow oxygen, patients treated with tofacitinib should be on at least prophylactic dose anticoagulant, patients who receive tofacitinib should not receive tocilizumab or other IL-6 inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, and the STOP-COVID Trial did not include immunocompromised patients.

### Case series: convalescent plasma therapy for patients with COVID-19 and primary antibody deficiency [^115PXkPX]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with primary antibody deficiency are at risk for severe and in many cases for prolonged COVID-19. Convalescent plasma treatment of immunocompromised individuals could be an option especially in countries with limited access to monoclonal antibody therapies. While studies in immunocompetent COVID19 patients have demonstrated only a limited benefit, evidence for the safety, timing, and effectiveness of this treatment in antibody-deficient patients is lacking. Here, we describe 16 cases with primary antibody deficiency treated with convalescent plasma in four medical centers. In our cohort, treatment was associated with a reduction in viral load and improvement of clinical symptoms, even when applied over a week after onset of infection. There were no relevant side effects besides a short-term fever reaction in one patient. Longitudinal full-genome sequencing revealed the emergence of mutations in the viral genome, potentially conferring an antibody escape in one patient with persistent viral RNA shedding upon plasma treatment. However, he resolved the infection after a second course of plasma treatment. Thus, our data suggest a therapeutic benefit of convalescent plasma treatment in patients with primary antibody deficiency even months after infection. While it appears to be safe, PCR follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 is advisable and early re-treatment might be considered in patients with persistent viral shedding.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — laboratory markers and antibiotic stewardship: the use of procalcitonin in a group of hospitals was not effective as a tool to encourage antibiotic discontinuation compared to clinical judgment. Mason and colleagues compared hospitalized cohorts of 619 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and found marked differences in white blood cell counts (6.78 COVID-19 vs. 12.48 CABP) and that CRP declined in 48–72 hours with antibiotic therapy in the CABP cohort but not the COVID-19 group, suggesting these findings can guide discontinuation when antibiotics are initiated empirically in COVID-19. Initiating and continuing empiric antibiotics at admission may lead to resistant superinfections; one study found antibiotic use in the first two days of admission for COVID-19 to be a risk factor for superinfection. Immunomodulatory therapies are recommended for many patients with severe and critical illness from COVID-19, including corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists, and JAK inhibitors.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — baricitinib in severe hospitalized patients: The guideline panel suggests baricitinib in addition to standard of care for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, and the guideline panel suggests baricitinib with remdesivir for persons for whom corticosteroids are indicated but who cannot receive them due to a contraindication. Baricitinib plus remdesivir should be reserved for patients who cannot take corticosteroids because dexamethasone has been proven to reduce mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and, for this reason, dexamethasone is recommended by the panel for this group, and it is uncertain whether baricitinib plus remdesivir will have the same benefit as dexamethasone. Evidence gaps remain, as of the time of this narrative, with no head-to-head trials evaluating either the combination of baricitinib plus tocilizumab or evaluating baricitinib compared to tocilizumab, and a post hoc subgroup analysis in the RECOVERY trial showed no difference in measured outcomes with concomitant baricitinib and tocilizumab, but further well-done studies are needed.

### Clinical considerations for special populations | COVID-19… [^1178YBgr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- There are additional considerations for specific people diagnosed with COVID-19. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Risk People with immunocompromising conditions and people who take immunosuppressive medications or therapies are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 including:

- Hospitalization
- Intensive care unit admission
- Mechanical ventilation
- Death Studies show that people with hematologic or solid organ cancer, with hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant, and who are taking immunosuppressive medications can experience lower vaccine effectiveness than those who are immunocompetent. Pemivibart is a monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis for people who:

- Are moderately or severely immunocompromised,
- Unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, and
- Meet the FDA-authorized conditions for use.

Pemivibart may provide another layer of protection against COVID-19 in addition to the protection provided through vaccination. It can be given at least 2 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Pemivibart is administered as a single intravenous infusion, over 60 minutes at a doctor's office or healthcare facility. If continued protection is needed, additional doses should be administered every 3 months. Pemivibart is still being studied and there is limited information about the safety and effectiveness of Pemivibart in preventing COVID-19. Treatment There are several therapeutics available, including:

- The oral antiviral medication ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir
- The intravenous antiviral remdesivir
- The oral antiviral molnupiravir These therapeutics are beneficial in this population for early treatment of COVID-19. Treatment is best initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 5 to 7 days after illness onset.

The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19. CP is recommended for patients with immunosuppressive disease or patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. CP may be administered in an outpatient or inpatient setting. For more information, please see the FDA Fact Sheet for Providers.

Clinical manifestations are highly variable, ranging from entirely asymptomatic infection to multiorgan failure and death. The outcome in immunocompromised patients is still a matter of debate, and so are the optimal strategies to prevent or treat the infection in these high-risk populations.

### Pragmatic recommendations for therapeutics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-and middle-income countries [^111LP5Ho]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients are currently limited, but numerous randomized controlled trials are being completed, and many are on the way. For COVID-19 patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), we recommend against using remdesivir outside of a clinical trial. We recommend against using hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. We suggest empiric antimicrobial treatment for likely coinfecting pathogens if an alternative infectious cause is likely. We suggest close monitoring without additional empiric antimicrobials if there are no clinical or laboratory signs of other infections. We recommend using oral or intravenous low-dose dexamethasone in adults with COVID-19 disease who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. We recommend against using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. We recommend using alternate equivalent doses of steroids in the event that dexamethasone is unavailable. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock requiring vasopressor support. We recommend against the use of convalescent plasma and interleukin-6 inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, for the treatment of COVID-19 in LMICs outside of clinical trials.

### Remdesivir reduced mortality in immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across variant waves: findings from routine clinical practice [^113RYiSf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, immunocompromised patients were prioritized to receive the serial-dose messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccines during phase 1 of the vaccine rollout from December 2020 onward. Since then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has progressively updated the recommendations to include additional doses and boosters for immunocompromised patients in August 2021, September 2021, and March 2022. The proportion of immunocompromised patients who had received at least 2 doses surpassed 80% by July 2021. However, given the risk of breakthrough infections and the elevated risk of progression to severe disease in this population, appropriate management of these patients with effective treatments remains an essential clinical priority. While immunocompromised patients represent a large proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, this is an understudied patient population due to their exclusion or underrepresentation in clinical trials. Treatment recommendations in COVID-19 clinical guidelines for immunocompromised patients mirror those for the general population. Specifically, the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 guidelines recommend that antivirals and immunomodulators be used in hospitalized, immunocompromised patients not requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring LFO. However, these recommendations are based on findings from clinical trials and observational studies in the nonimmunocompromised population from the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings therefore complement and build on existing evidence across the VOC periods for immunocompromised patients to inform clinical decision-making and guideline recommendation considerations. To focus on patients with COVID-19 present on admission and compare those individuals who did or did not receive remdesivir in a timely manner, we excluded patients who were administered remdesivir after the first 2 days of hospitalization. Consequently, findings may not represent patients who initiated remdesivir later. However, given that immunocompromised patients may harbor viable virus for extended periods, it can be expected that remdesivir initiation beyond the initial 2 days of hospitalization will have beneficial effects.

### Coronavirus disease-2019 in the immunocompromised host [^114spDiM]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunocompromised hosts, which encompass a diverse population of persons with malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus disease, solid organ, and hematologic transplants, autoimmune diseases, and primary immunodeficiencies, bear a significant burden of the morbidity and mortality due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Immunocompromised patients who develop COVID-19 have a more severe illness, higher hospitalization rates, and higher mortality rates than immunocompetent patients. There are no well-defined treatment strategies that are specific to immunocompromised patients and vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma are variably effective. This review focuses on the specific impact of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients and the gaps in knowledge that require further study.

### Immunomodulation as treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review of current modalities and future directions [^1149qx6m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, viral load peaks early and declines quickly after symptom onset. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is marked by aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses with an abnormal cytokine profile and multiorgan system dysfunction that persists well after viral clearance. A purely antiviral treatment strategy may therefore be insufficient, and antiviral agents have not shown a benefit later in the illness course. A number of immunomodulatory strategies are being tested, including corticosteroids, cytokine and anticytokine therapies, small molecule inhibitors, and cellular therapeutics. To date, the only drug to show a mortality benefit for COVID-19 in a randomized, controlled trial is dexamethasone. However, there remains uncertainty about which patients may benefit most and about longer-term complications, including secondary infections. Here, we review the immune dysregulation of severe COVID-19 and the existing data behind various immunomodulatory strategies, and we consider future directions of study.

### How immunocompromised hosts were left behind in the quest to control the COVID-19 pandemic [^112jiWta]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The immunocompromised population was disproportionately affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. However, these individuals were largely excluded from clinical trials of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecule antivirals. Although the community of scientists, clinical researchers, and funding agencies have proven that these therapeutics can be made and tested in record time, extending this progress to vulnerable and medically complex individuals from the start has been a missed opportunity. Here, we advocate that it is paramount to plan for future pandemics by investing in specific clinical trial infrastructure for the immunocompromised population to be prepared when the need arises.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

### Clinical course: progression, management, and treatment… [^111m9dL5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Management Patients with no risk factors for severe COVID-19 may benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Clinicians can also instruct patients on preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 symptoms that indicate additional medical attention. For patients at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, clinicians should offer antivirals to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death. Antivirals should be started within the first 5–7 days of symptom onset. If declined, patients should be closely monitored. Treatment The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir and Remdesivir for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in people at risk for severe illness. FDA has issued an EUA for COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

CP can be given to treat patients with immunosuppressive disease or patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, in an in- or out-patient setting. For more information, please see the FDA Fact Sheet for Providers and IDSA Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19. Management Clinical treatment recommendations for people with severe to critical COVID-19 are based on the severity of illness. Management often includes care of complications, including:

- Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS
- Sepsis and septic shock
- Elevation in inflammatory cytokines
- Complications from prolonged hospitalization, including:

- Thromboembolism
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia
- Hospital-acquired bacterial and fungal infections
- Thromboembolism. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 may experience an exacerbation of underlying comorbidities or onset of cardiac, vascular, endocrine, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system illness.

Treatment FDA has authorized or approved the use of several medications for patients with severe or critical illness due to COVID-19. Clinicians can find general considerations and recommendations for their care along with the rationale for the recommendations in the IDSA Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 and the ACP Clinical Guidelines and Recommendations on COVID-19.

### Remdesivir reduced mortality in immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across variant waves: findings from routine clinical practice [^113wVR65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Using a large dataset from routine clinical practice, we demonstrate a consistent and significant survival benefit associated with prompt remdesivir initiation in high-risk immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Most clinical guidelines currently recommend the administration of remdesivir in this patient population despite limited evidence among immunocompromised patients. Findings from this study lend further support to these recommendations and help to address a key knowledge gap cited by clinical guidelines. However, given that a large population of hospitalized immunocompromised patients were not administered remdesivir, there may be considerable room for improvement and standardization in managing these vulnerable patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to improve patient survival outcomes.

Remdesivir, with its established efficacy and safety profile and widespread availability, is an important therapeutic option for treatment of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients.

### COVID-19: immunopathology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment options [^114e9r1N]. The Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread globally despite the worldwide implementation of preventive measures to combat the disease. Although most COVID-19 cases are characterised by a mild, self-limiting disease course, a considerable subset of patients develop a more severe condition, varying from pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to multi-organ failure (MOF). Progression of COVID-19 is thought to occur as a result of a complex interplay between multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, all of which may orchestrate SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to organ-specific tissue damage. In this respect, dissecting currently available knowledge of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis is crucially important, not only to improve our understanding of its pathophysiology but also to fuel the rationale of both novel and repurposed treatment modalities. Various immune-mediated pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection are relevant in this context, which relate to innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity. Pathological findings in tissue specimens of patients with COVID-19 provide valuable information with regard to our understanding of pathophysiology as well as the development of evidence-based treatment regimens. This review provides an updated overview of the main pathological changes observed in COVID-19 within the most commonly affected organ systems, with special emphasis on immunopathology. Current management strategies for COVID-19 include supportive care and the use of repurposed or symptomatic drugs, such as dexamethasone, remdesivir, and anticoagulants. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19, and this requires appropriate measures to attenuate its spread and, above all, the development and implementation of effective vaccines. © 2021 The Authors.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: perspectives and lessons learned [^112YJtzt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

Methods

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

Recommendations

The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

### Remdesivir reduced mortality in immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across variant waves: findings from routine clinical practice [^1135ZQta]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunocompromised patients have largely been omitted or underrepresented in COVID-19 clinical trials due to ethical and feasibility concerns. As a result, clinical guidelines currently rely on evidence generated in the general population to provide recommendations relating to the treatment of COVID-19 in this high-risk population. This represents a considerable evidence gap regarding optimal treatment strategies in immunocompromised patients that requires urgent attention through real-world data studies. In the late pandemic phase, immunocompromised patients remain disproportionately at a higher risk of progression to severe disease than the general population, and clinical questions persist on the best way to manage this vulnerable group.

Remdesivir has demonstrated efficacy across the COVID-19 disease severity spectrum in clinical trials and effectiveness in real-world comparative effectiveness studies, including reductions in mortality. In PINETREE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted among high-risk patients (including some immunocompromised patients) in the outpatient setting, remdesivir was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization or death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI].03–.59). Similarly, remdesivir administration in high-risk patients reduced the risk of hospitalization or emergency department visit and in-hospital deterioration in observational studies. For example, among a cohort (N = 126) of high-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Mexico City, treatment with remdesivir significantly reduced hospitalization or death (HR, 0.16; 95% CI,.06–.44). Further evidence relating to the effectiveness of remdesivir in this vulnerable patient population is urgently required to inform clinical decision-making and update COVID-19 clinical guidelines.

In this study, we compared all-cause inpatient mortality in immunocompromised patients who received remdesivir upon hospital admission for COVID-19 to mortality in those who did not receive remdesivir during their hospitalization across different variant waves of the pandemic.

Corticosteroid use is nevertheless common in hospitalized children with COVID-19, and there is reason to believe that the risk benefit ratio would be similar in children and adults.

Randomization was performed by computer, stratified according to the origin of the immunocompromised state. All investigators, research staff, and participants were blinded to the allocated treatment until day 28, but unblinding was possible before day 28 when the primary endpoint was reached. Baseline data were collected using a web-based case report form. At baseline and after treatment, serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements were performed using LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (DiaSorin). Positivity was defined as anti-S IgG > 33.8 BAU/mL.

The primary endpoint of this study was the occurrence of severe COVID-19, evaluated up until day 28 after treatment, and defined as any of the following conditions: (1) respiratory deterioration requiring high-flow nasal oxygen or mechanical ventilation; (2) intensive care unit (ICU) admission for respiratory deterioration; (3) lack of clinical improvement from day 7 (no improvement in oxygen requirement or, in patients not requiring oxygen, in disease burden and fever); or (4) readmission for COVID-19. Secondary endpoints included occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the subgroup of patients that had no SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon inclusion, duration of hospitalization, 28-day mortality, the 4 individual endpoints that compose the primary endpoint, and serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Owing to their heightened susceptibility to developing complications from COVID-19 is a major challenge for immunocompromised patients. The margin for error is often narrow and appropriate prevention and treatment can be highly impactful. Much of the data to inform decisions in such patients is extrapolated from studies in non-immunocompromised patients and derived from observational experiences. The WHO recently called on "research funding agencies to prioritise and fund clinical trials that are well-designed and well-implemented, conducted in diverse settings and include all major population groups". Immunocompromised patients are one such group. Studies to better understand the efficacy of currently available antiviral agents alone and in combination, including use at times in their disease later than in the general population are needed.

DISCUSSION

Immunocompromised patients represent a vulnerable population at high-risk for breakthrough COVID-19 infections following vaccination and for progression to severe COVID-19. Yet, our understanding of optimal treatments for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients who are immunocompromised is limited [2, 7]. In this comparative effectiveness study of remdesivir, comprising the largest cohort of immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to date, remdesivir initiation on admission was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause inpatient mortality. Remdesivir survival benefit was observed across all VOC periods. Of the eligible patient population, 19 184 (63.1%) patients promptly initiated remdesivir on admission, yet 11 213 (36.9%) did not. Of the patients who never received remdesivir, 3179 (28.4%) subsequently died, thus highlighting a key missed opportunity to improve the outcomes of these patients.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — convalescent plasma use in patients with limited options: For those with disease who have no other treatment options, the IDSA guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset rather than no high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty of evidence). Other options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir; patient-specific factors and logistical considerations should drive agent choice, and data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting. Remarks note that in the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) only authorizes use in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, and that patients, particularly those who are not immunocompromised, who place a low value on uncertain benefits and a high value on avoiding possible adverse events would reasonably decline convalescent plasma. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Improving the outcomes of immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116cUUAg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent case studies have highlighted the fact that certain immunocompromised individuals are at risk for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication, intrahost viral evolution of multiply-mutated variants, and poor clinical outcomes. The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for 4 interrelated approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency, studies to evaluate immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, studies to evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for primary prophylaxis, and clinical trials of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19.

An additional problem is that immunocompromised patients frequently constitute an extreme minority of COVID-19 randomised clinical trial (RCT) participants. Immunocompromised patients represented small percentages or were completely excluded from multiple antiviral and immunomodulator COVID-19 randomised clinical trials. When immunocompromised patients are included, the extent or type of their immunosuppression is typically not well documented. This creates challenges, as clinical and policy decisions must be made based on extrapolation of data gathered from populations with more physiologic immunological baselines.

### Management of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients: an European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases consensus document [^116ABKeJ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Data on treatment of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients emerged recently; however, published guidelines for management of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients are lacking.

Aim and Methods

To develop consensus statements derived from evidence and expert opinion on management of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients an expert panel was convened by ESCMID. The expert panel developed a list of questions which are of general interest for clinicians and readers with backgrounds in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. Six questions were selected. For each question, systematic literature searches were undertaken. We considered most study types, including clinical trials, observational studies with or without a control group, systematic reviews, case series, and case reports. Detailed inclusion criteria were defined for each research question using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome format. Immunocompromised patients included patients with 1) primary immune deficiencies; 2) active malignancy or malignancy diagnosed or received cancer therapies within 1 year of COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) HIV with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 200 cells/mm3 or percentage < 14%; 4) receipt of solid organ transplant (SOT) within 1 year of COVID-19 diagnosis; 5) receipt of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy within 1 year of COVID-19 diagnosis; 6) receipt of systemic corticosteroid therapy with a dose of ≥ 20 mg prednisone or equivalent daily for ≥ 14 days or a cumulative dose of > 600 mg of prednisone; 7) receipt of biological immune modulators; or 8) receipt of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or other immunosuppressive drugs. The panel's consensus statements were based on evidence, supplemented by experience and expert opinion, especially in cases when evidence was limited or scarce. This document is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard.

Purpose Of Review

COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 6.6 million deaths globally. Tremendous efforts have been committed for the development of new and repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although different international and national guidelines share consensus in the management of COVID-19 disease with different levels of severity, new challenges have emerged, steering the need for ongoing research in advancing the clinical management of COVID-19.

Recent Findings

This review focuses on recent data from randomized trials and postmarketing real-world evidence for the treatment of mild to moderate disease in the outpatient setting and patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with varying level of severity. Relevant data for treatment of the latest omicron sub-variants in people who received vaccination are presented. Challenges in special populations, including immunocompromised hosts, patients with renal failure and pregnant women, are also discussed.

Summary

Treatment of COVID-19 should be personalized according to host characteristics, degree of severity and available treatment options.

### COVID-19 and immune checkpoint inhibitors: initial considerations [^113sVjFS]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 infections are characterized by inflammation of the lungs and other organs that ranges from mild and asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal. Patients who are immunocompromised and those with cardiopulmonary comorbidities appear to be particularly afflicted by this illness. During pandemic conditions, many aspects of cancer care have been impacted. One important clinical question is how to manage patients who need anticancer therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during these conditions. Herein, we consider diagnostic and therapeutic implications of using ICI during this unprecedented period of COVID-19 infections. In particular, we consider the impact of ICI on COVID-19 severity, decisions surrounding continuing or interrupting therapy, diagnostic measures in patients with symptoms or manifestations potentially consistent with either COVID-19 or ICI toxicity, and resumption of therapy in infected patients. While more robust data are needed to guide clinicians on management of patients with cancer who may be affected by COVID-19, we hope this commentary provides useful insights for the clinical community.

General principles of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy — During the early phase of infection, when viral load is high and the host's adaptive immune response has not mounted, treatments targeting viral replication are most likely to be effective; these include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir, remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and donor convalescent plasma, and timely initiation is critical because they are more efficacious when given within 5 to 7 days of symptom onset. Most patients do not progress to severe or critical disease, but some with risk factors do; later in the disease process, in severe and especially critical disease, an excessive and aberrant inflammatory response is implicated as the primary cause of immunopathological damage, and anti-inflammatory therapies like corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — Tofacitinib in hospitalized adults with severe illness: Recommendation 23 states the IDSA panel suggests tofacitinib rather than no tofacitinib for hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 who are not on non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Severe illness is defined as patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, including those on supplemental oxygen or oxygen through a high-flow device. Remarks note that tofacitinib appears to demonstrate the most benefit in those with severe COVID-19 on supplemental or high-flow oxygen, that patients treated with tofacitinib should be on at least prophylactic dose anticoagulant, that patients who receive tofacitinib should not receive tocilizumab or other IL-6 inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, and that the STOP-COVID Trial did not include immunocompromised patients. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

Table 35 — Assessment of clinical severity of COVID-19 to target treatments — states that diagnostic classification of severity helps target specific treatments and that "The clinician should identify which of the severity categories in Table 35 the patient falls into". Categories are: mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (SpO2 ≥ 94% on room air and not needing supplemental oxygen) with risk factors for progression to severe disease, hospitalization or death; severe but not critical COVID-19 (SpO2 < 94% on room air or needing low-flow supplemental oxygen); critical COVID-19 needing high-flow oxygen/ or non-invasive ventilation; and critical COVID-19 needing mechanical ventilation or ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). The footnote lists risk factors including age > 60 years, BMI > 25, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, or immunocompromised patients, and notes that risk factors for progression are changing as the epidemic evolves with new variants, vaccination, and previous infection rates.

### Navigating coronavirus disease 2019 in immunocompromised populations: evolving risk factors, treatment, and outcomes [^114ebczy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted immunocompromised hosts, leading to higher morbidity and mortality. The clinical outcomes have varied based on the degree of immunosuppression, treatment availability, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants, and vaccination status. This review discusses the evolving epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention strategies for COVID-19 in immunocompromised populations, including patients living with human immunodeficiency virus, solid organ transplant, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

Eligibility Criteria

Eligible patients had primary or secondary immunosuppression with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The intervention investigated was transfusion with COVID-19 convalescent plasma of any dosage. The control group was treated with standard of care according to local treatment guidelines, with or without a placebo. Eligible studies reported information on patients' clinical outcomes after transfusion with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. To perform a comprehensive analysis, the retrieved literature was grouped into 3 different strata, according to information characteristics: (1) controlled trials underwent a quantitative analysis (meta-analysis); (2) large case series with aggregated data underwent a descriptive analysis; and (3) case reports and case series with individual patient data underwent a single patient analysis.

Selected and Data Abstraction Processes

The data collection process was performed using a reciprocally blind evaluation by 2 reviewers (J.W.S. and M.F.), and disagreements were resolved by a third senior reviewer (D.F.). Further information on the selection process is presented in Figure 1. Data abstraction was performed using a standardized data abstraction form. Abstracted data, as available, included: patient's sex and age, the underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiency, the 11-point WHO COVID-19 disease severity score, the need for mechanical ventilation, survival at the end of follow-up, the number of COVID-19 convalescent plasma units transfused, the volume of each COVID-19 convalescent plasma unit, the total COVID-19 convalescent plasma volume transfused, the antibody level (either neutralizing antibodies titer or anti-spike IgG levels) and the antibody test used, time from admission to COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion, time from symptom onset to COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion, rapid clinical improvement (defined as a reduction in supplemental oxygen requirements within 5 days of COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion), duration of follow-up (days), need for admission to intensive care unit (ICU), ICU length of stay (days; total and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion), concomitant COVID-19 antiviral treatments (intravenous immunoglobulins, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies), and specific immunosuppressive drugs (anti–CD20 monoclonal antibodies).

### COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts: what we know so far [^113FrJhc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality for patients and stressed healthcare systems worldwide. The clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 among immunosuppressed patients, who are at presumed risk of more severe disease but who may also have decreased detrimental inflammatory responses, are not well characterized. We review the existing literature on COVID-19 among immunocompromised populations ranging from patients with cancer and solid-organ transplant recipients to patients with HIV and those receiving immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease. Patients with malignancy and solid-organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death, whereas for those with other types of immunocompromise, current evidence is less clear. Overall, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine the attributable risk of immunocompromising conditions and therapies on COVID-19 disease prognosis.
