## Question

indications for allopurinol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for allopurinol, including labeled uses, guideline-based indications, dosing principles, and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and limitations. Then, I should verify the guideline-based indications for gout and how they expand beyond the label. Next, I will examine dosing principles, including low-start and titration strategies, especially in CKD. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios, including malignancy-associated hyperuricemia, nephrolithiasis, and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary and ensure internal consistency with the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indications, because I need to anchor the foundation before layering guideline nuances. Allopurinol is indicated for the management of adults with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout, including acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis, and uric acid nephropathy, which I should double-check aligns with the current prescribing information and recent FDA summaries [^116AK8PU] [^113YnDzz]. It is also indicated for the management of hyperuricemia in adult and pediatric patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors who are receiving cancer therapy causing elevations of serum and urinary uric acid, with IV allopurinol reserved for those who cannot tolerate oral therapy, which I should verify against both oral and injectable labels [^116AK8PU] [^111QuEK4]. Additionally, it is indicated for recurrent calcium oxalate calculi in patients with hyperuricosuria, typically 24-hour uric acid excretion exceeding 800 mg/day in men or 750 mg/day in women despite lifestyle changes, which I will cross-check against the AUA and ACR guidance shortly [^116AK8PU] [^113aEa6E].

> Wait, let me verify the explicit limitations, because missing these would misframe practice. The FDA labeling explicitly states that allopurinol is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia, which is a key boundary condition I must keep in mind as I interpret guidelines that might seem more permissive at first glance [^116AK8PU] [^115ytto4].

> Next, I should review guideline-based indications for gout and ensure they align with or extend beyond labeling. The 2020 ACR guideline strongly recommends initiating urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage attributable to gout, or frequent flares, and strongly recommends allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT for all patients, including those with CKD stage 3 or higher, which is more specific than the label and reflects evolving evidence on safety and titration in CKD [^11323pWu] [^114pVPNt]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of these recommendations; they are graded as strong in the ACR publication set, underscoring their clinical weight [^114XNW5a] [^115C6rnR].

> I will now examine the treat-to-target strategy and dosing principles, since indication without titration is insufficient. ACR 2020 strongly recommends starting at a low dose of allopurinol, typically 100 mg/day or lower in CKD, and titrating to achieve serum urate less than 6 mg/dL, with concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months to mitigate mobilization flares, which I should confirm against the ACR dosing and prophylaxis sections [^114mYfJc] [^114XNW5a] [^112LeKpG]. Let me consider renal impairment more carefully; I initially thought maximum doses must be capped in CKD, but wait, the 2020 ACR and subsequent commentaries support cautious upward titration to reach target in CKD, with a very low starting dose and slow increments to mitigate hypersensitivity risk, which I should reconcile with older renally adjusted schemas [^113BoToL] [^1145XqoH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives before confirming allopurinol's first-line status and comparative safety. ACR's preference for allopurinol over febuxostat is driven by cost and cardiovascular safety concerns, particularly the signal of increased cardiovascular death with febuxostat observed in the CARES program and reflected in FDA warnings, so I should anchor this to both ACR and FDA sources to avoid overstatement [^113bRHCX] [^11222BMs] [^114gH7Sj]. I should double-check comparative effectiveness data; contemporary trials show allopurinol and febuxostat can achieve similar serum urate targets, with allopurinol noninferior for flare control, which supports choosing allopurinol first in most patients [^111oMWri].

> Let me think about special populations and dosing in CKD, because this is where practice often diverges from legacy rules. ACR supports dose escalation above 300 mg/day in CKD when needed to reach target, contradicting older maximum-dose restrictions, while emphasizing very low starts and slow titration; this is echoed by KDIGO commentary that cautions against capping maintenance doses and details a conservative-start approach tailored to eGFR, which I should integrate into practical dosing advice [^113BoToL] [^1145XqoH]. I need to ensure I also flag AHS risk, which is higher in CKD and with higher starting doses; starting low and going slow reduces risk, and in high-risk ancestries, HLA-B✱5801 screening is reasonable, although the strongest evidence is in Asian populations [^112PCith] [^1168EXpt].

> Next, I should review malignancy-associated hyperuricemia, since tumor lysis prophylaxis is a distinct labeled use. For prevention of chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia, oral allopurinol is typically initiated 24–48 hours before cytoreductive therapy and continued for several days, with aggressive hydration and alkalinization to maintain high urine output; IV allopurinol is reserved for patients who cannot take oral therapy, and I should confirm these details against both oral and injectable labels and DailyMed summaries [^116AK8PU] [^116BJWtr] [^111QuEK4] [^112XSWcD]. But wait, what if the oncology setting prefers rasburicase in high-risk TLS; that is correct, yet the question is about allopurinol indications, so I will keep the focus on allopurinol's role while acknowledging that rasburicase is often preferred in high-burden settings [^notfound].

> I will now examine nephrolithiasis, because this is easy to conflate with uric acid stones. Let me first confirm that allopurinol is not first-line for uric acid stones; urine alkalinization with potassium citrate is preferred because unduly acidic urine is the key driver, so I should correct any initial impulse to use allopurinol first in pure uric acid stone formers [^115kZGcy]. Allopurinol is indicated to reduce recurrence of calcium oxalate stones in patients with hyperuricosuria and normal urinary calcium, with guideline support from AUA and ACR, and a typical dose around 200–300 mg/day adjusted to urinary uric acid response, which I should verify against both urology guidelines and FDA dosing for this indication [^1142eNrD] [^112toZph] [^116bN1rS] [^113aEa6E]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered listing uric acid stones under allopurinol indications, but that would have been misleading; the correct nuance is that allopurinol is for calcium oxalate stone formers with hyperuricosuria, not for first-line management of uric acid stones, which require alkalinization instead [^115kZGcy].

> Let me consider asymptomatic hyperuricemia explicitly, because guidelines sometimes create confusion here. I should confirm that pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy, including allopurinol, is not recommended for asymptomatic hyperuricemia in the absence of gout manifestations, despite earlier musings that some guidelines might imply otherwise; the ACR 2020 guideline makes this explicit, and the FDA label likewise states allopurinol is not recommended for asymptomatic hyperuricemia, so I need to ensure I do not overextend indications [^115ytto4] [^116AK8PU]. Hold on, I should verify that ACR does not soften this stance in any conditional recommendations; it does not, reinforcing that treatment should be reserved for symptomatic gout or other defined indications like hyperuricosuria with calcium oxalate stones [^115ytto4].

> Next, I should review management of allopurinol failure and desensitization, since indications also encompass what to do when allopurinol is not tolerated. ACR conditionally recommends allopurinol desensitization for patients with prior allergic responses who cannot use other oral ULT, recognizing the evidence is limited and clinician experience varies, which I should note as a niche but important indication pathway [^113oFsaU] [^116eiQw9]. Let me reconsider alternatives briefly. Febuxostat is indicated when allopurinol is not tolerated or inadequate at maximal titration, but given the CV death signal, it should be used cautiously in patients with established cardiovascular disease after shared decision-making, which I should make clear to avoid overgeneralization [^1116WZ28] [^11222BMs].

> I should double-check that my synthesis remains internally consistent with the hierarchy of evidence. The labeled uses anchor the minimum scope, ACR 2020 refines indications and first-line choice for gout across CKD stages, and urology guidelines define the stone indication narrowly for calcium oxalate formers with hyperuricosuria, all of which align with the points above and are supported by the cited sources [^116AK8PU] [^11323pWu] [^1142eNrD]. Hold on, I should verify that I did not omit the treat-to-target prophylaxis recommendation; yes, I included the 3–6 month anti-inflammatory prophylaxis with ULT initiation, which is a strong ACR recommendation and is crucial to safe induction [^114XNW5a].

> Final clinical synthesis: Allopurinol is indicated for chronic gout management in adults with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout, as the preferred first-line urate-lowering therapy and especially in patients with CKD when dosed low and titrated carefully. For prevention of chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia in malignancy, including via IV formulation when oral therapy is not feasible. And for recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in the setting of hyperuricosuria with normal urinary calcium, with all uses following treat-to-target urate lowering and with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis during initiation to reduce flare risk, while avoiding use in asymptomatic hyperuricemia [^116AK8PU] [^11323pWu] [^114XNW5a] [^111QuEK4] [^1142eNrD] [^115ytto4].

## References

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Therapeutic advances in gout [^116xcbwS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent developments in the management of gout.

Recent Findings

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gout from EULAR, quality of care indicators, and outcome measures for clinical trials have been published. The standards of gout diagnosis and management are very low. Allopurinol remains the mainstay for serum uric acid lowering therapy. In an important percentage of patients receiving allopurinol, serum uric acid levels are insufficient to promote crystal dissolution. Febuxostat, a new serum uric acid lowering drug, has shown good results. Information on uricase continues to appear. For treatment of gouty inflammation, etoricoxib (a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor) has been shown to be as effective as indomethacin. Finally, the association of gout with the metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities, and the newly described association of gout with myocardial infarction, bring lifestyle and dietary modifications to the front in the management of gout.

Summary

Proper gout management requires changes to the physician's attitude towards the disease; essentially: (1) an unequivocal diagnosis based in urate crystal identification, (2) a clearly settled aim of the treatment: crystal elimination from the joints and elsewhere, and (3) proper use of the available therapeutic alternatives. Promoting a proper lifestyle appears to be especially important.

### Factors influencing allopurinol initiation in primary care [^1166diiG]. Annals of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Despite guidance on appropriate initiation, urate-lowering therapy is prescribed for only a minority of patients with gout. Electronic health records for 8,142 patients with gout were used to investigate the effect of age, sex, comorbidities, number of consultations, and meeting internationally agreed eligibility criteria on time to allopurinol initiation. Time to first prescription was modeled using multilevel Cox proportional hazards regression. Allopurinol initiation was positively associated with meeting eligibility criteria at diagnosis of gout, but negatively associated with becoming eligible after diagnosis. Managing gout as a chronic disease, with regular reviews to discuss allopurinol treatment, may reduce barriers to treatment.

### Allopurinol is the most common cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Europe and Israel [^116CGVJT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions.

Objectives

We sought to update knowledge on the causes of SJS or TEN with a focus on the rate of allopurinol-associated cases and to identify risk factors for allopurinol-associated SJS or TEN.

Methods

We conducted a multinational case-control study.

Results

In all, 379 patients with severe cutaneous adverse reactions validated as SJS or TEN and 1505 matched hospitalized control subjects were enrolled. Allopurinol was the drug most frequently associated with SJS or TEN, with 66 exposed patients (17.4%) and 28 exposed control subjects (1.9%) (adjusted odds ratio = 18, 95% confidence interval: 11–32). Allopurinol use was greater than in a previous case-control European study. Daily doses equal to or greater than 200 mg were associated with a higher risk (adjusted odds ratio = 36, 95% confidence interval: 17–76) than lower doses (adjusted odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1–8.4). The risk was restricted to short-term use (≤ 8 weeks). The use of comedications did not increase the risk.

Limitations

Nonsystematic recording of the indications for allopurinol use was a limitation.

Conclusions

Results of this multinational study (EuroSCAR) revealed that allopurinol is the drug most commonly associated with SJS or TEN. The incidence of allopurinol-associated SJS or TEN has increased possibly because of increased use and dosages of this drug.

### Uricosuric medications for chronic gout [^116dvUsj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Uricosuric agents have long been used in the treatment of gout but there is little evidence regarding their benefit and safety in this condition.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of uricosuric medications in the treatment of chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 4, 2013), Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE for studies to the 13 May 2013. We also searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism abstracts. WE considered black box warnings and searched drug safety databases to identify and describe rare adverse events.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) that compared uricosuric medications (benzbromarone, probenecid or sulphinpyrazone) alone or in combination with another therapy (placebo or other active uric acid-lowering medication, or non-pharmacological treatment) in adults with chronic gout for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and performed a risk of bias assessment. Main outcomes were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events, total adverse events, pain reduction, function and tophus regression.

Main Results

The search identified four RCTs and one CCT that evaluated the benefit and safety of uricosurics for gout. One study (65 participants) compared benzbromarone with allopurinol for a duration of four months; one compared benzbromarone with allopurinol (36 participants) for a duration of nine to 24 months; one study (62 participants) compared benzbromarone with probenecid for two months and one study (74 participants) compared benzbromarone with probenecid. One study (37 participants) compared allopurinol with probenecid. No study was completely free from bias. Low-quality evidence from one study (55 participants) comparing benzbromarone with allopurinol indicated uncertain effects in terms of frequency of acute gout attacks (4% with benzbromarone versus 0% with allopurinol; risk ratio (RR) 3.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 84.13), while moderate-quality evidence from two studies (101 participants; treated for four to nine months) indicated similar proportions of participants achieving serum urate normalisation (73.9% with benzbromarone versus 60% with allopurinol; pooled RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.79). Low-quality evidence indicated uncertain differences in withdrawals due to adverse events (7.1% with benzbromarone versus 6.1% with allopurinol; pooled RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.28 to 5.62), and total adverse events (20% with benzbromarone versus 6.7% with allopurinol; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 14.16). The study did not measure pain reduction, function and tophus regression. When comparing benzbromarone with probenecid, there was moderate-quality evidence based on one study (62 participants) that participants taking benzbromarone were more likely to achieve serum urate normalisation after two months (81.5% with benzbromarone versus 57.1% with probenecid; RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.00). This indicated that when compared with probenecid, five participants needed to be treated with benzbromarone in order to have one additional person achieve serum urate normalisation (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5). However, the second study reported no difference in the absolute decrease in serum urate between these groups after 12 weeks. Low-quality evidence from two studies (129 participants) indicated uncertain differences between treatments in the frequency of acute gout attacks (6.3% with benzbromarone versus 10.6% with probenecid; pooled RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.83); fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with benzbromarone (2% with benzbromarone versus 17% with probenecid; pooled RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.79, NNTB 7) and fewer total adverse events (21% with benzbromarone versus 47% with probenecid; pooled RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74; NNTB 4). The studies did not measure pain reduction, function and tophus regression. Low-quality evidence based on one small CCT (37 participants) indicated uncertainty around the difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks between probenecid and allopurinol after 18 to 20 months' treatment (53% with probenecid versus 55% with allopurinol; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.75). The study did not measure or report the proportion achieving serum urate normalisation, pain reduction, function, tophus regression, withdrawal due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There was moderate-quality evidence that there is probably no important difference between benzbromarone and allopurinol at achieving serum urate normalisation, but that benzbromarone is probably more successful than probenecid at achieving serum urate normalisation in people with gout. There is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, based on low-quality evidence from only one or two trials, on the number of acute gout attacks, the number of withdrawals due to adverse events or the total number of participants experiencing adverse events when comparing benzbromarone with allopurinol. However, when compared with probenecid, benzbromarone resulted in fewer withdrawals due to adverse events and fewer participants experiencing adverse events. Low-quality evidence from one small study indicated uncertain effects in the incidence of acute gout attacks when comparing probenecid with allopurinol therapy. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of performance and other biases and imprecision.

### Febuxostat (Uloric) [^115mh2Qy]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with ULORIC had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the ULORIC group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). ULORIC was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, ULORIC should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of ULORIC when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on ULORIC. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2	Gout Flares

After initiation of ULORIC, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when ULORIC is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^112Enj59]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gout, more specifically with respect to indications for switching urate-lowering agents, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to switch allopurinol to febuxostat or a uricosuric or combined with a uricosuric, if the serum urate target cannot be reached by an appropriate dose of allopurinol or when allopurinol is not tolerated.

### Allopurinol [^11417bTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Gout: state of the art after a decade of developments [^117SUop2]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^111dUatd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

Gout — choice of initial ULT — treatment with allopurinol as the preferred first-line agent, over all other ULTs, is strongly recommended for all patients, including those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (stage ≥ 3); dosing efficacy is noted when dosed appropriately, often requiring > 300 mg/day up to the maximum FDA-approved dose of 800 mg/day. In patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (stage ≥ 3), the choice of either allopurinol or febuxostat over probenecid is strongly recommended, and the choice of pegloticase as a first-line therapy is strongly recommended against.

### Safety and efficacy of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease [^1174e49s]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence surrounding the use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and discuss safety and efficacy considerations of such use.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted through MEDLINE (1950-July 2013), PubMed (1965-July 2013), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2013) using the search terms allopurinol and kidney or renal. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Gout management with allopurinol in patients with CKD can be challenging because of the risk of adverse events and uncertain efficacy. Not all gout treatment guidelines provide recommendations for allopurinol use specifically in patients with CKD. Literature regarding the safety and efficacy of dosing allopurinol in CKD has shown inconsistent results and is based primarily on retrospective, case cohort or observational data. Some trials have demonstrated an increased risk of allopurinol-induced adverse reactions in patients with CKD, whereas others have not confirmed renal insufficiency as a risk factor. More CKD patients achieved a target uric acid level in studies where the allopurinol dose was titrated to effect as compared with those studies in which patients were given renally adjusted or untitrated allopurinol doses.

Conclusions

Studies evaluating allopurinol use in patients with CKD have reported inconsistent findings relative to safety and efficacy. Providers should be aware of the potential risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome as well as the need for reducing the initiation dose and gradual titration of allopurinol to safely achieve a target serum urate level in this population.

### Safety of urate-lowering therapies: managing the risks to gain the benefits [^117TDXoV]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a metabolic disorder of purine metabolism and uric acid elimination. Over time, acute gout can develop into a chronic, disabling arthropathy, often associated with multiple comorbidities. Gout patients have often been undertreated, partly because of the clinician's perceived risks of a therapy outweighing its potential benefits. The approval of new therapies to treat hyperuricemia in gout has led to a new understanding of gout management and medication safety regarding new and old therapies. This review focuses on potential safety issues of currently available urate-lowering therapies and outlines strategies to minimize risks so their benefits can be reached.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^116WTQcK]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This Consensus Statement highlights where knowledge regarding the management of gout in people with CKD remains incomplete, and proposes a research agenda to address the most important areas of uncertainty, which includes a better understanding of the natural history of gout in people with CKD. A greater knowledge of the safety of treatments used for the management of gout flares, as well as the requirement for flare prophylaxis in this population, is also needed. Additional investigation is required to determine the safe dosing of allopurinol in people with CKD, as well the prediction and management of AHS. Further research is also required to help determine whether febuxostat is associated with increased cardiovascular risk or is in fact risk-neutral, and whether febuxostat is safer to use than allopurinol in people with gout and CKD. The safety and efficacy of uricosuric medications at different levels of renal function is another area where further research would be of benefit. Evidence regarding the use of pegloticase in people with gout and CKD is limited. From the standpoint of treating or preventing gout flares, the knowledge gaps are also substantial and revolve around the safe use and dosing of colchicine, the safety and efficacy of IL-1 inhibitors and the absolute indication for prophylactic therapy in all patients in whom ULT is being initiated.

In order to resolve these issues, it is important that researchers include patients with all stages of CKD in clinical trials of gout management wherever possible, and undertake pre-specified analyses of safety and efficacy according to renal function, using standardized outcome measures.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^111JghgA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

Recent Findings

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^114XNW5a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^115qVvr2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

Allopurinol dosing in CKD — safety and titration guidance highlight that "The most concerning adverse effect is allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS), which usually occurs within 6–8 weeks after initiation and has been associated with CKD, initial allopurinol dose, and the presence of the HLA*B5801 allele". A conservative-start approach is described: "starting with allopurinol at 100 mg for eGFR 45–60 mL/min and at 50 mg (half of a 100 mg tablet) per day in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min". If tolerated, "the dose can be increased to 200 mg or 100 mg, respectively", with further titration "based on target uric acid levels of ≤ 6 mg/dL", and the page cautions that "Restricting the maintenance dose of allopurinol… results in failure to reach target uric acid concentrations".

### Allopurinol dosing in renal impairment: walking the tightrope between adequate urate lowering and adverse events [^113wEiii]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Allopurinol is the mainstay of urate-lowering therapy for patients with gout and impaired renal function. Although rare, a life-threatening hypersensitivity syndrome may occur with this drug. The risk of this allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is increased in renal impairment. The recognition that AHS may be because of delayed-type hypersensitivity to oxypurinol, the main metabolite of allopurinol, and that oxypurinol concentrations are frequently elevated in patients with renal impairment prescribed standard doses of allopurinol has led to the widespread adoption of allopurinol-dosing guidelines. These guidelines advocate allopurinol dose reduction according to creatinine clearance in patients with renal impairment. However, recent studies have challenged the role of these guidelines, suggesting that AHS may occur even at low doses of allopurinol, and that these guidelines lead to under-treatment of hyperuricemia, a key therapeutic target in gout. Based on current data, we advocate gradual introduction of allopurinol according to current treatment guidelines, with close monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations. In patients with severe disease and persistent hyperuricemia, allopurinol dose escalation above those recommended by the guidelines should be considered, with careful evaluation of the benefits and risks of therapy. Further work is needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of allopurinol dose escalation, particularly in patients with renal impairment.

### How to prevent allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions? [^112PCith]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a severe and sometimes life-threatening adverse drug reaction. Although AHS is rare, the number of patients with gout requiring allopurinol is high, and there are sufficient overall cases of AHS to warrant consideration of preventive measures. Most cases occur within 8–9 weeks of commencing allopurinol, and good patient education at initiation may lead to rapid drug cessation at onset of symptoms. Pretreatment testing for HLA-B✱5801 and avoidance of allopurinol when positive reduces the risk of AHS and is cost-effective in some ethnic groups. A low starting allopurinol dose may reduce AHS risk, but the relationship between maintenance dose and AHS is more controversial. Chronic kidney disease increases AHS risk, but slowly increasing the allopurinol dose in chronic kidney disease has not been associated with AHS. Alternative newer treatments are available for patients at risk of AHS, but similar adverse reactions can also occur with these.

### Febuxostat tablets 40 mg (febuxostat) [^115AKjQD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in allopurinol group (56 of 3,092;). febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2 Gout Flares

After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

Urate-lowering therapies

The appropriate use of ULT in people with gout and CKD is one of the most controversial areas of gout management. For example, the latest guidelines issued by the ACR, EULAR and the British Society for Rheumatology differ in important areas, such as allopurinol dosing in people with CKD. For drugs used as ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, benzbromarone, lesinurad and pegloticase), efficacy outcomes, as endorsed by most rheumatology professional society management guidelines, include achieving a target serum urate concentration (that is, < 6 mg/dl or < 5 mg/dl), resolution of tophi, reduction or elimination of gout flares over time, improvement in quality of life indicators, and radiographic changes. For this G-CAN Consensus Statement, safety outcomes for each drug were individualized. The general issues identified as well as specific issues with individual drugs are discussed below and the G-CAN proposed research priorities are outlined in Box 4.

### Allopurinol [^11713uhJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Gout

The initial recommended dosage for the management of gout is 100 mg orally daily, with weekly increments of 100 mg, until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. Initiating treatment with lower dosages of allopurinol tablets and titrating slowly, decreases the risk of gout flares and drug induced serious adverse reactions.

In patients with renal impairment the initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily with lower dose increases until serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The minimal effective dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Doses in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. Monitor patients' kidney function during the early stages of administration of allopurinol tablets and decrease the dosage or withdraw the drug if persistent abnormalities in kidney function occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

The dosage of allopurinol tablets to achieve control of gout varies with the severity of the disease. In general, gout control is achieved with 200 mg to 300 mg daily in patients with mild gout, and with 400 mg to 600 mg daily in patients with moderate to severe tophaceous gout. Gout attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^116Luks7]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Allopurinol versus usual care in UK patients with ischaemic heart disease (ALL-HEART): a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial [^114Yj7nn]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study ALL-HEART was published by Isla S Mackenzie and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease. In the ALL-HEART study, the trial question was: what is the role of allopurinol in patients with ischemic heart disease? In the ALL-HEART study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ALL-HEART study, the population was: 5721 patients (1400 female, 4321 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout. The key exclusion criteria were history of gout; moderate-severe renal impairment; moderate-to-severe HF; significant hepatic disease; severe adverse skin reaction to any drug or significant malignancy within the past 5 years. In the ALL-HEART study, the interventions were: n = 2853 allopurinol (up-titration to an oral dose of 600 mg/day, 300 mg/day in moderate renal impairment) n = 2868 standard care (continuation of usual care). In the ALL-HEART study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death (11% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.82 to 1.12). In the ALL-HEART study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause (10.1% vs. 10.6%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15) No significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (5.5% vs. 6%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (3.9% vs. 3.8%; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.43). In the ALL-HEART study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant difference in new rash during the previous 12 months (13.1% vs. 9.1%). In the ALL-HEART study, the conclusion was: in patients aged ≥ 60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout, allopurinol was not superior to standard care with respect to nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^1168EXpt]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

### Debates in gout management [^116e6oAj]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the findings of recently published translational research studies that have the potential to directly impact on the management of gout patients.

Recent Findings

Recent research suggests that treat-to-target urate-lowering treatment (ULT) alongside individualized education about gout, and shared decision making results in excellent adherence with ULT and prevents gout flares in the long term. Such interventions should preferentially be delivered face-to-face rather than remotely. The recently published CARES study raises the possibility that febuxostat increases the risk of death in people with preexisting major cardiovascular diseases, and, allopurinol should remain the first-choice ULT. There is paucity of data on the dosing of ULT for managing hyperuricaemia in gout patients with chronic kidney disease. However, recent research suggests that the dose of allopurinol can be gradually increased to above the conventional renal dose in people with chronic kidney disease without allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. However, additional larger studies are needed in this field.

Summary

In summary, long-term treat-to-target ULT prevents gout flares and improves quality of life. Given the recent safety concerns, gradually up-titrated allopurinol remains the first-line urate-lowering drug.

### Allopurinol [^116BJWtr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If a dose of allopurinol tablets is missed, there is no need to double the dose at the next scheduled time. Allopurinol tablets is generally better tolerated if taken following meals. A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters and the maintenance of a neutral or preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable.

Inform patients of the possibility of gout flares [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Instruct them to remain on allopurinol tablets if this occurs and to increase fluid intake during therapy to prevent kidney stones.

Concurrent Use of Uricosuric Agents

Some patients, may benefit using uricosuric agents concurrently, to reduce serum uric acid to target levels.

When transferring a patient from a uricosuric agent to allopurinol tablets, reduce the dose of the uricosuric agent over a period of several weeks and increase the dose of allopurinol tablets gradually to the required dose needed to maintain target serum uric acid level.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy

Initiate therapy with allopurinol tablets 24 hours to 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy known to cause tumor cell lysis. Administer fluids sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters in adults (at least 100 mL/m2/hour in pediatric patients) with a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine.

The recommended dosage of allopurinol tablets is:

Adult patients – 300 mg to 800 mg orally daily
Pediatric patients - 100 mg/m2orally every 8 hours to 12 hours (10 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day). In patients with body surface area < 0.5 m2, consider using an alternative allopurinol formulation.

The dosage of allopurinol tablets to maintain normal or near-normal serum uric acid varies with the severity of the disease. Monitor serum uric acid levels at least daily and administer allopurinol tablets at a dose and frequency to maintain the serum uric acid within the normal range. Discontinue allopurinol tablets when the risk of tumor lysis has abated (2 days to 3 days from start of chemotherapy). For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

2.1	Recommended Dosage

Initiate therapy with Allopurinol Sodium for Injection 24 to 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy known to cause tumor cell lysis. Additionally, administer fluids sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least two liters in adults with a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine.

The recommended daily dose of Allopurinol Sodium for Injection is shown in Table 1. Administer the daily dose as single infusion or in equally divided infusions at 6-, 8-, or 12-hour intervals at a rate appropriate for the volume of infusate.

The dosage of Allopurinol Sodium for Injection to lower serum uric acid to normal or near-normal varies with the severity of the disease. Monitor serum uric acid levels at least daily and administer Allopurinol Sodium for Injection at a dose and frequency to maintain the serum uric acid within the normal range. Discontinue Allopurinol Sodium for Injection when the patient is able to take oral therapy or when the risk of tumor lysis has abated.

2.2	Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment

Reduce the dose of Allopurinol Sodium for Injection in patients with impaired renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended dosage reductions of Allopurinol Sodium for Injection in adult patients with renal impairment are shown in Table 2.

Treatment with Allopurinol Sodium for Injection has not been studied in pediatric patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis. For pediatric patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis, consider the risks and potential benefits before initiating treatment with Allopurinol Sodium for Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Febuxostat [^11222BMs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2 Gout Flares

After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.6 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

The recommended initial dosages of allopurinol tablets in adult patients with renal impairment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with Gout

The recommended initial dosages in adult patients with gout with impaired kidney function are shown in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Initiate treatment with a lower dose of allopurinol tablets and increase the dose gradually in 50 mg/day increments every 2 weeks to 4 weeks in patients with renal impairment to decrease the risk of drug induced serious adverse reactions. Use the lowest dose possible to achieve the desired effect on serum and/or urine uric acid. Monitor kidney function in gout patients with chronic kidney disease closely when initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets and decrease or withdraw the drug if increased abnormalities in kidney function appear and persist.

The maximum dosage that should be used in patients with various levels of renal impairment is not defined at different eGFR levels.

Patients with Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi

Data are insufficient to provide dosage recommendations for the treatment of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi in patients with renal impairment. Allopurinol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney, and accumulation of the drug can occur in renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), adjusted to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid (SUA) of < 6 mg/dl, remains the standard of care for the chronic management of gout. New urate-lowering medications are important options; however, these agents should be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or cannot achieve SUA < 6 mg/dl on allopurinol. The result of oxypurinol monitoring to guide allopurinol therapy suggests that allopurinol should still be considered first-line ULT for gout.

### New developments in gout [^116kwExV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. This review summarizes the most recent studies on newer therapeutics, disease management strategies and treatment recommendations.

Recent Findings

There are several new therapeutic agents being investigated both for the management of the acute gout symptoms, targeting interleukin-1β, as well as urate-lowering therapies including uricase and inhibitors of renal urate transporter proteins. Interventions led by pharmacists and nurses, which include patient education, lifestyle advice, monitoring and titration of urate-lowering medications have been implemented to improve gout management. Recently, the American College of Rheumatology has published guidelines for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches for hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis.

Summary

New therapeutic agents targeting the mechanism of inflammation (IL-1β) are under investigation. In addition, new urate-lowering medications to be used alone or in combination with allopurinol are undergoing rigorous evaluation to use for patients not responding to or unable to take current therapies. There is also increasing interest in redesigning clinical care to improve patient education, self-management training and urate-lowering medication titration. Although we await results of these investigations, the American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines provide a framework for clinicians in order to provide optimal gout care.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^1142eNrD]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — allopurinol for recurrent calcium oxalate stones states that clinicians should offer allopurinol to patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones who have hyperuricosuria and normal urinary calcium (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). A prospective randomized controlled trial demonstrated that allopurinol reduced the risk of recurrent calcium oxalate stones in the setting of hyperuricosuria (urinary uric acid excretion > 800 mg/day) and normocalciuria, while noting that whether the drug is effective in patients with hypercalciuria has not been established and that hyperuricosuria is not a required criterion for allopurinol therapy.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^115sedX8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Allopurinol for chronic gout [^1172BLY4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here. Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function. Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period. Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^114a6Ujq]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi Data are insufficient to provide dosage recommendations for the treatment of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi in patients with renal impairment. Allopurinol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney, and accumulation of the drug can occur in renal failure. Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy The recommended dosage of allopurinol tablets for the management of hyperuricemia associated with cancer therapy in adult patients with renal impairment is shown in Table 2. Table
2. Recommended Dosage of Allopurinol Tablets in Adult Patients for Management of Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy with Renal Impairment. Treatment with allopurinol tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis.

There is insufficient information to establish dosing for allopurinol tablets in pediatric patients with renal impairment. In these patients, consider the risks and potential benefits before initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets. Allopurinol tablets, USP have functional scoring and are available in the following strengths: Allopurinol tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to allopurinol or to any of the ingredients of allopurinol tablets. Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported in patients taking allopurinol. These reactions occur in approximately 5 in 10, 000 patients taking allopurinol.

Other serious hypersensitivity reactions that have been reported include exfoliative, urticarial and purpuric lesions, generalized vasculitis, and irreversible hepatotoxicity. Discontinue allopurinol permanently at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs which may indicate a hypersensitivity reaction. Consider screening for HLA-B5801 before starting treatment with allopurinol in patients from populations in which the prevalence of this HLA-B5801 allele is known to be high. Screening is generally not recommended in patients from populations in which the prevalence of HLA-B58: 01 is low, or in current allopurinol users, as the risk of SJS/TEN/DRESS is largely confined to the first few months of therapy, regardless of HLA- B58: 01 status. Discontinue allopurinol immediately if a skin rash develops. Instruct patients to stop taking allopurinol immediately and seek medical attention promptly if they develop a rash.

Gout flares have been reported during initiation of treatment with allopurinol, even when normal or subnormal serum uric acid levels have been attained due to the mobilization of urates from tissue deposits. Even with adequate therapy with allopurinol, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently to achieve control of the flares. The flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy. In order to prevent gout flares when treatment with allopurinol is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with colchicine or an anti-inflammatory agent is recommended. Advise patients to continue allopurinol and prophylactic treatment even if gout flares occur, as it may take months to achieve control of gout flares. Treatment with allopurinol may result in acute kidney injury due to formation of xanthine calculi or due to precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^114TwUVG]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Phase 1: specification of the scope

The scope of the DA was to facilitate a shared decision whether or not to (re)start ULT in a clinical encounter between a physician and a gout patient who has an indication to (re)start ULT. In line with the SDM paradigm, a patient can decline participation in the SDM process and rely on the physicians' decision. To enhance usability in daily practice, the content of the DA was aligned to the national and international recommendations. On that line, experts agreed that lifestyle changes should be positioned as integral part of gout management and flare prophylaxis before initiating ULT should be emphasised. Also, the potential of sUA target in management should be mentioned, and a distinction should be made between first-line and second-line ULT (first-line allopurinol and second-line febuxostat and benzbromaron). Rasburicase was not included as it is not registered for chronic urate lowering. Lesinurad was finally not included as by the time of the pilot testing, the European Medicines Agency withdrawn lesinurad on request of the market. Within these boundaries, patients can choose between available ULTs.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^116Xneop]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature for people who have gout. Gout flares affect just about every aspect of life including physical, psychological, social and family life. Prevention of gout flares is therefore a key goal of management for both health care providers and people with gout. Despite this, the majority of studies of urate‐lowering therapies have used serum urate (SU) as a "surrogate" measure for gout flares. However, the burden of gout flares is multifaceted and includes the number of flares as well as the severity of each individual flare. Defining the overall flare burden for people with gout has been challenging because of variable reporting and lack of a validated flares severity definition.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Flare prevention and treatment are critical aspects of gout management.
As gout flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient.
Most people commencing allopurinol are able to achieve gout flare patient‐acceptable symptom state or low disease activity in the second six months of treatment.

### What is allopurinol failure and what should we Do about It? [^111UKkfy]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol is the most widely used urate-lowering medication worldwide. However, allopurinol failure is frequently observed in clinical practice. In this review, we provide a framework for assessing allopurinol failure, which includes failure of allopurinol to control serum urate concentrations, failure of allopurinol to control clinical symptoms, and failure of allopurinol due to an adverse drug reaction. Understanding the causes of allopurinol failure underpins the approach required to turn failure into success in gout management.

### Management of gout by UK rheumatologists: a British Society for Rheumatology national audit [^117HnXyK]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the concordance of gout management by UK rheumatologists with evidence-based best-practice recommendations.

Methods

Data were collected on patients newly referred to UK rheumatology out-patient departments over an 8-week period. Baseline data included demographics, method of diagnosis, clinical features, comorbidities, urate-lowering therapy (ULT), prophylaxis and blood tests. Twelve months later, the most recent serum uric acid level was collected. Management was compared with audit standards derived from the 2006 EULAR recommendations, 2007 British Society for Rheumatology/British Health Professionals in Rheumatology guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence febuxostat technology appraisal.

Results

Data were collected for 434 patients from 91 rheumatology departments (mean age 59.8 years, 82% male). Diagnosis was crystal-proven in 13%. Of 106 taking a diuretic, this was reduced/stopped in 29%. ULT was continued/initiated in 76% of those with one or more indication for ULT. One hundred and fifty-eight patients started allopurinol: the starting dose was most commonly 100 mg daily (82%); in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min the highest starting dose was 100 mg daily. Of 199 who started ULT, prophylaxis was co-prescribed for 94%. Fifty patients started a uricosuric or febuxostat: 84% had taken allopurinol previously. Of 44 commenced on febuxostat, 18% had a history of heart disease. By 12 months, serum uric acid levels ≤ 360 and < 300 μmol/l were achieved by 45 and 25%, respectively.

Conclusion

Gout management by UK rheumatologists concords well with guidelines for most audit standards. However, fewer than half of patients achieved a target serum uric level over 12 months. Rheumatologists should help ensure that ULT is optimized to achieve target serum uric acid levels to benefit patients.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^113KNquS]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Impact of comorbidities on urate-lowering treatment

Comorbidities also interfere with the use of ULD to treat gout. The increased risk of premature death and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities with disease duration have contributed to the recommendation by the EULAR to consider ULD indication early after a definite diagnosis of gout. According to the EULAR and ACR, CKD should prompt the indication for ULDs.

Patients with heart failure are often prescribed furosemide, which has been found to decrease the hypouricaemic effect of allopurinol while increasing the blood concentration of oxypurinol. This paradox appears to rely on a recently described additional mode of action of allopurinol, reducing XO expression in vitro, a mechanism that is abolished by furosemide. Cardiovascular diseases, and not diuretics, might increase the rate of serious cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) to allopurinol. Indeed, a recent nationwide study in Taiwan found that cardiovascular (and renal) diseases increased the risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity, with no association seen with diuretic use.

The dose of allopurinol for CKD patients is debated between European and US gout experts. Most country agencies have reduced the maximum approved dose of allopurinol according to creatinine clearance following a report of high doses of allopurinol being associated with SCARs in CKD patients. This dose reduction translates into a frequent inability to reach the desired uricaemia. When designing their recommendations, ACR experts were confident in the risk minimisation obtained with slow increases of allopurinol dosage as observed in a retrospective case–control study and recommended titrating allopurinol above the authorised dose, if necessary, to reach the uricaemia target. The EULAR committee had a more conservative approach, taking into account the rarity of SCARs, which leads to great uncertainties in defining risk factors, a recent report of increased severity of skin reactions in CKD patients with sustained oxypurinol levels, and the availability of alternative drugs such as febuxostat, which was approved without dosing changes for mild and moderate renal failure. The EULAR recommendations retained the limitation of the maximum daily dose in CKD patients according to creatinine clearance. If the limited dose did not allow reaching of the target, the EULAR recommended a shift to alternative drugs such as febuxostat.

### The challenges of approaching and managing gout [^117MghQL]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite many effective treatments for gout, its management remains a challenge internationally. Options for optimizing gout management may differ in different practice sizes and settings. Gout incidence is rising and it continues to be associated with increased mortality. Education of patients and medical providers is essential, and newer gout medications need to be used in the most appropriate ways for cost-effective therapy. Special consideration needs to be given to such populations as the elderly and those with renal and cardiovascular disease in gout management. New agents are in development, which may add to the armamentarium for gout management.

### Comparative effectiveness of allopurinol and febuxostat in gout management [^111oMWri]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The relative efficacy and safety of allopurinol and febuxostat when used according to current guidelines for the treatment of hyperuricemia are unknown. This double-blind noninferiority trial examined these issues.

Methods

Participants with gout and hyperuricemia (with at least 33% having stage 3 chronic kidney disease) were randomly assigned to allopurinol or febuxostat in this 72-week trial, with doses titrated to target serum urate. The trial had three phases: titration (weeks 0 to 24), maintenance (weeks 25 to 48), and observation (weeks 49 to 72). Allopurinol and febuxostat were initiated at daily doses of 100 and 40 mg, with maximum titration to 800 and 120 mg, respectively. Antiinflammatory prophylaxis was given during phases 1 and 2. The primary end point was the proportion of patients experiencing one or more flares during phase 3, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of less than 8 percentage points between allopurinol and febuxostat. Secondary end points included efficacy in patients with chronic kidney disease, proportion achieving target serum urate levels, and serious adverse events.

Results

This study included 940 participants; 20.1% withdrew, with similar proportions in treatment arms. During phase 3, 36.5% of allopurinol-treated participants had one flare or more compared with 43.5% of febuxostat-treated participants (P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Overall, 80% of participants achieved mean target urates during phase 2 with no differences by treatment. There were no treatment differences (including cardiovascular events) in serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Allopurinol and febuxostat achieved serum urate goals in patients with gout; allopurinol was noninferior to febuxostat in controlling flares. Similar outcomes were noted in participants with stage 3 chronic kidney disease.

### Cardiovascular safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in patients with gout and cardiovascular comorbidities [^111GtWDu]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Comprehensive safety evaluation of new drugs for noncardiac indications is needed in the area of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, particularly in populations with high CV risk such as gout. Febuxostat is a potent nonpurine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase approved for the treatment of gout. Long-term CV safety of febuxostat is being established in a randomized, allopurinol-controlled clinical study in patients with gout who have increased CV risk using an analytical approach that provides 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (HR) (febuxostat relative to allopurinol). The primary CV end point for this trial is a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and unstable angina requiring urgent coronary revascularization. Approximately 7,500 men and women with gout and CV disease are being recruited and will be followed up for up to 5 years postrandomization. The statistical plan for the trial uses a design that evaluates the HR of febuxostat to allopurinol based on the primary CV composite end point when there are a maximum of 624 CV events. Interim analyses will be conducted when approximately 25%, 50%, and 75% of events have occurred. At each analysis, if the upper 1-sided confidence limit of the HR is < 1.3, the study will be stopped, and the noninferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to CV risk will be declared. The CARES trial will define the CV safety profile of febuxostat and allopurinol in gout patients at high risk for CV events.
