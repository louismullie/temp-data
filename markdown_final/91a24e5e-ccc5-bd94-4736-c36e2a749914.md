## Question

What antibiotics should I prescribe for penumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what antibiotics to prescribe for pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of pneumonia. Then, I should verify patient-specific risk factors and severity. Next, I will consider outpatient versus inpatient management and the role of diagnostic testing. After that, I will select empiric antibiotic regimens by scenario, including special populations and stewardship considerations. Finally, I should confirm duration, de-escalation, and follow-up plans, and I will double-check any conflicting recommendations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification, because treatment hinges on whether this is community-acquired pneumonia versus hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, and whether the patient is an adult or child, as guidelines and pathogens differ substantially. I should also distinguish severe from non-severe CAP using validated tools like CURB-65 or PSI to guide site of care and intensity of therapy, and I need to remember that the 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline explicitly abandoned the HCAP category, so I should not use HCAP to justify broader empiric coverage in CAP patients [^112DXJyG] [^115U4hGg].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors that modify empiric choices, especially risks for MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, because these drive whether to add vancomycin, linezolid, or antipseudomonal agents. Prior respiratory isolation of MRSA or Pseudomonas, recent hospitalization with parenteral antibiotics, and structural lung disease are key risks, and I need to check local antibiograms to validate these risks and avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy [^115bxj19] [^115WEwym].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient therapy. I should confirm whether the patient has comorbidities or recent antibiotics, because that changes the regimen. For healthy adult outpatients without comorbidities, amoxicillin 1 g three times daily is a strong first-line option, with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as an alternative. Macrolide monotherapy is only reasonable if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25%, which is rarely the case in the U.S., so I should be cautious there [^117DmiBG] [^116R7qqa].

> Wait, let me verify the outpatient regimen for patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotics. In that scenario, I should broaden coverage to include atypicals and more resistant pneumococci, so a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefuroxime plus a macrolide, or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, are appropriate. I need to ensure I balance efficacy with stewardship, and I should avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to adverse effects and resistance promotion [^113g1GAS] [^115ZzQTE].

> I will now examine inpatient nonsevere CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk. The preferred regimens are a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with the caveat that beta-lactam monotherapy is not routinely recommended for inpatients. If macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, a beta-lactam plus doxycycline is a conditional alternative, and I should confirm that I am not inadvertently omitting atypical coverage in this setting [^111VxjWa] [^111VxjWa].

> For severe CAP, I should confirm that combination therapy is indicated. The guideline strongly recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and it advises against fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline for severe disease. Observational data suggest mortality benefit with macrolide-containing regimens, though I need to acknowledge this is largely observational and not from randomized trials [^111VxjWa] [^112LnUKE].

> But wait, what if the patient has risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas? In that case, I should add MRSA-active therapy such as vancomycin or linezolid and antipseudomonal coverage such as piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or a carbapenem, ideally guided by prior cultures and local epidemiology. I should also obtain blood and sputum cultures before antibiotics when feasible and plan to de-escalate at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving [^115WEwym] [^115hg7iB].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, amoxicillin is first-line for nonsevere CAP, with 3 days sufficient for fast-breathing pneumonia and 5 days for chest-indrawing disease. In severe cases, parenteral ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin is reasonable, and I should avoid routine macrolides unless pertussis or atypical pathogens are suspected. For COVID-19 with suspected bacterial co-infection, I should be restrictive, obtain cultures when possible, and stop antibiotics within 48–72 hours if no bacterial evidence emerges and the patient stabilizes [^114J7VCE] [^113cecd2] [^115L1gPn].

> I need to ensure I address diagnostic testing because it shapes de-escalation. Routine sputum cultures are not needed for outpatients, but in severe CAP or when MRSA or Pseudomonas is suspected, I should obtain sputum and blood cultures before antibiotics. Urinary antigen testing for pneumococcus and Legionella is reserved for severe cases or outbreaks, and I should not rely on procalcitonin to decide whether to start antibiotics in CAP, though serial procalcitonin may help shorten duration in some inpatient contexts [^115hg7iB] [^111Zef8a] [^1129tjB2].

> Next, I should review duration and the principle of clinical stability. For most CAP, a minimum of 5 days is sufficient once the patient achieves clinical stability for 48–72 hours, whereas MRSA or Pseudomonas pneumonia should be treated for 7 days. I should double-check that I am not extending therapy unnecessarily, as prolonged courses increase adverse events and resistance without benefit when stability is achieved early [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to nonresponders. If there is no improvement by 48–72 hours, I need to reconsider the diagnosis, look for complications like empyema or abscess, reassess for resistant pathogens including MRSA or Pseudomonas, and verify drug delivery and dosing. Escalation should be targeted based on new data rather than reflexively broadening spectrum, and I should keep in mind that bactericidal versus bacteriostatic distinctions rarely explain failure in CAP [^11737JPS].

> I should confirm stewardship touchpoints throughout. Avoid unnecessary macrolide monotherapy where resistance is high, prefer narrower agents when appropriate, obtain cultures to enable de-escalation, and use the shortest effective duration. Recent randomized data show that real-time CPOE prompts reducing empiric extended-spectrum therapy in low-risk inpatients decreased broad-spectrum days without harming safety outcomes, reinforcing the value of risk-stratified prescribing [^116NEoCU] [^1177EUQF].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and prevention are addressed. Routine repeat chest imaging is not needed for most CAP patients unless there is clinical deterioration or concern for underlying malignancy, and I should reinforce pneumococcal and influenza vaccination, smoking cessation, and chronic disease optimization to reduce recurrence and severity [^114VuhzV] [^114anNs8].

For pneumonia, **empiric therapy should match severity and risk factors** [^112DXJyG]. In **outpatients without comorbidities**, use amoxicillin or doxycycline; if local macrolide resistance is low (< 25%), a macrolide is acceptable [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa]. In **outpatients with comorbidities**, use amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) [^117DmiBG]. For **hospitalized patients**, use a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus a macrolide, or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone; add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors are present [^117DLH1Y] [^115WEwym]. Treat for a minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before stopping [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

## Outpatient antibiotic therapy

### Outpatients without comorbidities

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) [^113g1GAS].
- **Alternative therapy**: Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence) [^113g1GAS].
- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin or clarithromycin only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is < 25% (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa].

---

### Outpatients with comorbidities

Comorbidities include chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia. For these patients, **recommended regimens** include:

| **Regimen** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg orally twice daily | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence |
| Respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence |
| Combination therapy: beta-lactam (cefpodoxime or cefuroxime) plus macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) | Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence |

---

## Inpatient antibiotic therapy

### Non-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

For non-severe CAP, **preferred regimens** include a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) alone [^117DLH1Y]. If macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, a beta-lactam plus doxycycline is an option (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence) [^117DLH1Y].

---

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

For severe CAP, **recommended regimens** include a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) [^111VxjWa] [^112LnUKE]. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy and beta-lactam plus doxycycline are not recommended for severe CAP [^111VxjWa].

---

## Special considerations

- **MRSA coverage**: Add vancomycin or linezolid if risk factors are present (e.g. prior respiratory isolation of MRSA, recent hospitalization, or recent parenteral antibiotic use) [^115WEwym].
- **Pseudomonas coverage**: Add antipseudomonal therapy (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or carbapenem) if risk factors are present (e.g. structural lung disease, recent hospitalization, or recent parenteral antibiotic use) [^115WEwym].
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Standard empiric therapy covers anaerobes; additional anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended [^117DmiBG].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days**, ensuring clinical stability (normalizing vital signs, ability to eat, normal mentation) for 48–72 hours before discontinuation [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF]. For MRSA or Pseudomonas pneumonia, extend therapy to 7 days [^11422hz5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Outpatient, no comorbidities | - Amoxicillin <br/> - Or doxycycline <br/> - Or macrolide (if resistance < 25%) [^113g1GAS] |
| Outpatient, comorbidities | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone <br/> - Or beta-lactam + macrolide [^notfound] |
| Inpatient, non-severe CAP | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone [^117DLH1Y] |
| Inpatient, severe CAP | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Or beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^111VxjWa] [^112LnUKE] |
| MRSA risk factors | Add vancomycin or linezolid [^115WEwym] |
| Pseudomonas risk factors | Add antipseudomonal therapy [^115WEwym] |

---

Empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia should be **individualized based on severity, comorbidities, and risk factors**, with a minimum of 5 days of therapy once clinical stability is achieved.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP? [^111Z9J6W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diagnoses encountered in clinical practice and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines is inconsistent and the erroneous diagnosis of CAP and misuse of antibiotics is prevalent in both inpatients and outpatients. This review summarizes interventions that may be promoted by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve outcomes for patients with CAP.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### New guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116nZujz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We highlight the recent advances in the guidelines for treating patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP).

Recent Findings

sCAP is a significant cause of hospital admissions. We performed an extensive review of the literature, covering studies from the last several years, to summarise the most important points in the diagnosis and treatment of patients hospitalised with sCAP.

Summary

sCAP is associated with a high clinical burden. Therefore, deep knowledge is necessary for its management. In general, diagnosis, treatment and management are based on many published guidelines. However, the mortality rate is still unacceptably high, indicating the need for clear recommendations in the management of patients with sCAP. The choice of empirical antibiotic therapy for sCAP depends on multiple factors, such as national and local antimicrobial susceptibility data and the characteristics of the patients, including their risk factors for acquiring infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Currently, there are several published international guidelines. The aim of this review is to explore the areas that require further knowledge and new recommendations for current clinical practice.

### Recommendations for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: review of recent international guidelines [^1119yGN8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^11737JPS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Management of pneumonia in critically ill patients [^117CFqhd]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe pneumonia is associated with high mortality (short and long term), as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Appropriate diagnosis and early initiation of adequate antimicrobial treatment for severe pneumonia are crucial in improving survival among critically ill patients. Identifying the underlying causative pathogen is also critical for antimicrobial stewardship. However, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging in most patients, especially in those with chronic underlying disease; those who received previous antibiotic treatment; and those treated with mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, as antimicrobial therapy must be empiric, national and international guidelines recommend initial antimicrobial treatment according to the location's epidemiology; for patients admitted to the intensive care unit, specific recommendations on disease management are available. Adherence to pneumonia guidelines is associated with better outcomes in severe pneumonia. Yet, the continuing and necessary research on severe pneumonia is expansive, inviting different perspectives on host immunological responses, assessment of illness severity, microbial causes, risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic options.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116xUUHf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) outpatient antibiotic evidence — "RCTs of antibiotic treatment regimens for adults with CAP provide little evidence of either superiority or equivalence of one antibiotic regimen over another", partly due to comparators no longer available, and "We identified 16 relevant RCTs comparing two antibiotic regimens for the treatment of outpatient CAP… Meta-analyses of each of these groups of studies revealed no differences in relevant outcomes between any of the compared regimens".

### Choosing antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^113HbCQx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is known as a major worldwide health concern considering it has been shown to account for 78% of infection-related deaths in the USA. It is a common cause for hospitalization with a continued incidence rise in the elderly, high mortality rate and long-term sequelae in critically ill patients. Severe CAP (sCAP) is an accepted terminology used to describe ICU admitted patients with CAP. The aim of this review is to further report on the major advances in treatment for patients with sCAP including new antibiotic treatments despite macrolide resistance as seen in the ICU, and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship interventions that may lead to the reduction broad-spectrum antibiotic use in CAP.

Recent Findings

We aim to examine the most recent findings in order to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic choices, timing regimens and evidence for clinical effectiveness. This will be addressed by focusing on the use combination therapies, the usefulness of severity scores and the difficulty to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens, including gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Relevant reports referenced within included randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews and international guidelines where applicable.

Summary

New antibiotics have been recently launched with direct agent-specific properties that have been shown to avoid the overuse of previous broad-spectrum antibiotics when treating patients sCAP. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are now recommended and imperative in improving a patients' prognosis, there are also some considerations when prescribing antibiotics that are beyond the spectrum. There is a need to implement effective policies of de-escalation to avoid antibiotic resistance and the risk for developing subsequent infections by combining informed clinical judgement and the application of biomarkers. Reaching clinical stability and avoidance of treatment failure are the most important pillars in treatment success.

### Antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze [^114QGHBL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of death amongst children under five years of age, and accounts for approximately two million deaths annually. Pneumonia can be classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Classification includes assessment of certain clinical signs and symptoms, and the severity of the disease. Treatment is then tailored according to the classification. For non-severe pneumonia, the WHO recommends treatment with oral antibiotics. We used the 2014 WHO definition of non-severe pneumonia for this review: an acute episode of cough, or difficulty in breathing, combined with fast breathing and chest indrawing. The WHO recommends treating non-severe pneumonia with oral antibiotics. Pneumonia is more commonly caused by viruses that do not require antibiotic treatment, but pneumonia caused by bacteria needs management with antibiotics to avoid complications. There is no clear way to quickly distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia. It is considered safe to give antibiotics, however, this may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, and thus, limit their use in future infections. Therefore, it is essential to explore the efficacy of antibiotics for children with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers (December 2020).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children, aged 2 to 59 months, with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze. We defined non-severe pneumonia as 'a cough or difficulty in breathing, with rapid breathing (a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute or more for children aged 2 to 12 months, or a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute or more for children aged 12 to 59 months), chest indrawing and wheeze'. We excluded trials involving children with severe or very severe pneumonia, and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our primary outcomes were clinical cure and treatment failure; secondary outcomes were relapse, mortality, and treatment harms. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Two review authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. We contacted the authors of two included trials and the author of the trial awaiting classification to obtain missing numerical outcome data.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 3256 children aged between 2 to 59 months, who exhibited features of non-severe pneumonia with wheeze. The included trials were multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials carried out in Malawi, Pakistan, and India. The children were treated with a three-day course of amoxicillin or placebo, and were followed up for a total of two weeks. We assessed the included trials at overall low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition bias, and selective reporting. Only one trial was assessed to be at high risk for blinding of outcome assessors. One trial is awaiting classification Antibiotic therapy may result in a reduction of treatment failure by 20% (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.94; three trials; 3222 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic therapy probably results in little or no difference to clinical cure (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; one trial; 456 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and in little or no difference to relapse (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34; three trials; 2795 participants; low-certainty evidence), and treatment harms (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.09; three trials, 3253 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials (2112 participants) reported on mortality; no deaths occurred in either group. One trial reported cases of hospitalisation, diarrhoea (with and without dehydration), rash (without itch), tremors, mild nausea and vomiting.

Authors' Conclusions

We do not currently have enough evidence to support or challenge the continued use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia. There is a clear need for RCTs to address this question in children aged 2 to 59 months with 2014 WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

### Antibiotic-resistant community-acquired bacterial pneumonia [^115muTF9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern, and prudent use of antibiotics is essential to preserve the current armamentarium of effective drugs. Acute respiratory tract infection is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. In particular, community-acquired pneumonia poses a significant health challenge and economic burden globally, especially in the current landscape of a dense and aging population. By updating the knowledge on the common antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in community-acquired respiratory tract infections, their prevalence, and resistance may pave the way to enhancing appropriate antibiotic use in the ambulatory and health care setting.

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^112iEELC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia in hospitalized patients despite clinical signs within the reference range?

Findings

In this cohort study of 12 273 patients treated for possible pneumonia in 4 hospitals, all cardinal signs for pneumonia were within reference ranges in 18.6% of patients with possible community-acquired pneumonia and 13.5% of patients with possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotics were continued for 3 days or longer after all clinical signs were normal in 34.8% of patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia and 38.4% treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Meaning

Findings of this study suggest that antibiotics are prescribed frequently for suspected pneumonia in patients with clinical signs within reference ranges and continued for 3 days or longer after clinical signs normalize; these findings suggest potential targets to improve prescribing.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Recommendations for antibacterial therapy in adults with COVID-19-an evidence based guideline [^115L1gPn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy constituted a multidisciplinary expert committee to provide evidence-based recommendation for the use of antibacterial therapy in hospitalized adults with a respiratory infection and suspected or proven 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Questions Addressed By The Guideline and Recommendations

We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers. Larger, prospective studies about the epidemiology of bacterial infections in COVID-19 are urgently needed to confirm our conclusions and ultimately prevent unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: a systematic survey [^113rYJne]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of recommendations

Of the 63 recommendations that pertain to antibiotic use, 49 (78%) focused on general antibiotic use, whereas 14 (22%) specifically addressed azithromycin use in the context of COVID-19. Healthcare setting varied across recommendations; all patients (n = 22, 35%); hospitalised (n = 19, 30%); ICU only (n = 13, 21%); outpatient (n = 5, 8%); inpatient non-ICU (n = 3, 5%), and outpatient and inpatient non-ICU (n = 1, 2%). Guidelines focused on adult patients (n = 40, 63%), both adults and children or not specified (n = 22, 35%), or children only (n = 1, 2%).

Recommendations were most likely to address antibiotic initiation (n = 52, 83%) and less commonly antibiotic selection (n = 13, 21%), and duration of therapy (n = 15, 24%). The full list of guidelines and recommendations is available in Supplementary Table S1.

Of recommendations focusing on empiric antibiotic use in COVID-19, 6/43 (14%) suggest empiric antibiotic therapy regardless of evidence of bacterial infection. All but one of these recommendations apply to critically ill patients with COVID-19. A single guideline recommended "usual antimicrobial treatment" for pneumonia for all patients with COVID-19 (e.g. with and without radiographic abnormalities, in all levels of severity). Five of the above six recommendations suggest bacteriological microbiological sampling in order to rule out co-infection. Similarly, four of the six guidelines recommend de-escalating or discontinuing antimicrobial on the basis of additional (e.g. microbiological) findings.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is a revision of the 2009 "Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Adult Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Community-Acquired Pneumonia". A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, what clinical decision aids can inform the determination of patient disposition? (2) In the adult emergency department patient with community-acquired pneumonia, what biomarkers can be used to direct initial antimicrobial therapy? (3) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, does a single dose of parenteral antibiotics in the emergency department followed by oral treatment versus oral treatment alone improve outcomes? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^111Zef8a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Routine treatment of CAP with macrolide monotherapy is no longer recommended unless local resistance is low. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are preferred in low-risk patients.
- Five-day treatment courses are recommended for all patients with CAP, with reassessment following treatment. From the AFP Editors. Diagnostic Testing BLOOD AND SPUTUM CULTURES Routine blood and sputum cultures have not been shown to improve patient outcomes in CAP. Sputum cultures are recommended before treatment initiation only if the patient has severe CAP, and particularly if he or she is intubated; if the patient has a history of methicillin-resistant. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has severe CAP; was previously or is currently being treated empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, particularly respiratory infections; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days.

The yield of blood cultures is low in adults without severe CAP, and empiric therapy is rarely changed based on these results. URINARY ANTIGEN TESTING Urinary antigen testing for Legionella or pneumococcus has not been shown to improve outcomes. Based on low-quality evidence, the ATS/IDSA guideline suggests that routine urine testing for pneumococcal antigen be performed only in severe cases of CAP and that urine testing for Legionella antigen be performed only in cases of severe CAP, exposure to a Legionella outbreak, or travel to an endemic area. CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY Corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed for patients with CAP or severe influenzal pneumonia. Although two studies showed significant improvements in outcomes when corticosteroids were prescribed for CAP, these results are questionable because of study flaws, and subsequent studies have not shown improvement in clinically relevant outcomes.

Antiviral agents should be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, regardless of the duration of illness before diagnosis or the treatment setting. Although the benefits are greatest when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, there is evidence supporting later initiation of therapy.

### Antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia [^112hrKSv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, complicating the medical course of approximately 10% of mechanically-ventilated patients, with an estimated attributable mortality of 13%. To treat VAP empirically, the American Thoracic Society currently recommends antibiotic therapy based on the patients' risk of colonisation by an organism with multidrug resistance. The selection of initial antibiotic therapy in VAP is important, as inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While guidelines exist for the antibiotic treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) from the American Thoracic Society and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, there are many limitations in the quality of available evidence. This systematic review aimed to summarise the results of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare empirical antibiotic regimens for VAP.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the effect of different empirical antimicrobial therapies on the survival and clinical cure of adult patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Secondary objectives included reporting the incidence of adverse events, new superinfections, length of hospital stay, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay associated with these therapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL and Web of Science to December 2015; we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to September 2016.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently assessed RCTs comparing empirical antibiotic treatments of VAP in adult patients, where VAP was defined as new-onset pneumonia that developed more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. Physicians and researchers were not required to be blinded for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study data. We pooled studies and analysed them in two ways. We examined monotherapy, or a single experimental antimicrobial drug, versus combination therapy, or multiple experimental antimicrobial drugs. We also examined carbapenem therapy versus non-carbapenem therapy.

Main Results

We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), length of stay in ICU (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.23) or adverse events (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison. We determined clinical cure for this comparison to be of very low-quality evidence. For our second comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives only one meta-analysis could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic regimens. Two studies compared tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (N = 2; OR tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.84). Of importance, this effect was due to a single study. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between carbapenem and non-carbapenem therapies (N = 1; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.19) or adverse events (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09), but we found that carbapenems are associated with a statistically significant increase in the clinical cure (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12 for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and N = 2; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.43 for clinically evaluable patients analysis). For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable populations) to moderate. We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events to be low.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of people with VAP. Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP. Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic choice for VAP, but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotics.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^114Z9RM5]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background to childhood pneumonia guidelines

Childhood pneumonia continues to rank as the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children globally. The current Kenyan guidelines (Table 1) for antibiotic treatment of community-acquired childhood pneumonia are adapted from those of WHO and recommend classification of children into one of 3 clinical categories of severity to guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Key treatment recommendations for children without HIV infection are largely unchanged since their first launch over twenty years ago and concerns have been expressed over their current and future appropriateness. Perhaps linked to such concerns there is evidence of poor guideline adherence revealing possible preferences for 'stronger' (broader spectrum, non-beta-lactam) antibiotics.

GRADE, GRADE-lite or an inability to make the GRADE?

When resources are limited compromises are made. We illustrate such compromises here both to indicate where sharing resources, capacity and prior work may be helpful and because they raise the question of whether or not what we describe, as an illustration of what may be possible in low income settings, is a 'GRADE-compliant' process.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: review of recent statements and position papers [^114Zrbnc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^1135HPLU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major public health problem all over the world. The increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a matter of concern for physicians when choosing antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. This review focuses on the current recommendations of antibiotic treatment, recent information concerning antibiotic resistance of pathogens, and the advances in antibiotic therapy in the field of CAP.

Recent Findings

A significant increase in the frequency of resistance to the antibiotics commonly used against causative pathogens of CAP, such as β-lactams or macrolides, has been reported in recent years. At present, the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae remains low. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been reported as causes of severe CAP. Several newly-developed antibiotics, including cepholosporins, ketolides and quinolones, present marked activity in vitro against the main causative pathogens of CAP. Many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the newer antibiotics compared with conventional antimicrobial therapy in mild-to-moderate CAP.

Summary

An increase of resistance to the antibiotics used in CAP has been documented over the years. Several new antibiotics have been developed for treating CAP, with promising results. However, data regarding their efficacy and safety in patients with severe CAP are lacking.

### Systematic review on antibiotic therapy for pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age [^113cecd2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a force to reckon with, as it accounts for 1.1 million of all deaths in children less than 5 years of age globally, with disproportionately higher mortality occurring in the low and middle income-countries (LMICs) of Southeast Asia and Africa. Existing strategies to curb pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality have not effectively translated into meaningful control of pneumonia-related burden. In the present systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of trials conducted in LMICs to determine the most suitable antibiotic therapy for treating pneumonia (very severe, severe and non-severe). While previous reviews, including the most recent review by Lodha et al, have focused either on single modality of antibiotic therapy (such as choice of antibiotic) or children under the age of 16 years, the current review updates evidence on the choice of drug, duration, route and combination of antibiotics in children specifically between 2 and 59 months of age. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the route, dose, combination and duration of antibiotics in the management of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP. Study participants included children between 2 and 59 months of age with CAP. All available titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by two review authors independently. All data was entered and analysed using Review Manager 5 software. The review identified 8122 studies on initial search, of which 22 studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. Evidence from these trials showed a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin to be effective for managing very severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age, and oral amoxicillin to be equally efficacious, as other parenteral antibiotics for managing severe pneumonia in children of this particular age group. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia as well. The review further found a short 3 day course of antibiotics to be equally beneficial as 5 day course for managing non-severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age. This review updates evidence on the general spectrum of antibiotic recommendation for CAP in children between 2 and 59 months of age, which is an age group that warrants special focus owing to its high disease and mortality burden. Evidence derived from the review found oral amoxicillin to be equally effective as parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in the 2–59 month age group, which holds important implications for LMICs where parenteral drug administration is an issue. Also, the review's finding that 3 day course of antibiotic is equally effective as 5 day course for non-severe pneumonia for 2–59 months of age is again beneficial for LMICs, as a shorter therapy will be associated with a lower cost. The review addresses some research gaps in antibiotic treatment for CAP as well, and this crucial information is presented with the aim of providing a targeted cure for the middle and low income setting.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^1131ADAR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment and CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side-effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Sanofi, and Yamanouchi. No language restrictions were applied in any of the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one or more antibiotics were tested for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory adolescent or adult patients. Studies testing one or more antibiotic and reporting the diagnostic criteria used in selecting patients as well as the clinical outcomes achieved were included. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and study reports assessed by two independent reviewers (LMB and TJMV). Authors of studies were contacted as needed to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. The data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2.2 Software. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 622 patients aged 12 years and older diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included. The quality of the studies and of the reporting was variable. A variety of clinical, radiological and bacteriological diagnostic criteria and outcomes were reported. Overall there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics under study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in ambulatory patients. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations.

### Clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the emergency department [^112bZTuo]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical policy represents an approach that emphasizes key clinical information to determine the severity of CAP. By using this approach, a determination of whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or inpatient may be made. Recommendations about the utility of ancillary studies and the use of antibiotics are also given. As more of the questions are answered through controlled studies, an evidence-based approach to this problem will become increasingly important in improving the outcome of patients with CAP.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — core pathogen coverage: In patients with suspected VAP, we recommend including coverage for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli in all empiric regimens (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Values and preferences note these recommendations balance providing early appropriate antibiotic coverage with avoiding superfluous treatment that may lead to adverse drug effects, C. difficile infections, antibiotic resistance, and increased cost.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric gram-negative coverage and number of anti-Pseudomonas agents: The evidence indicated that approximately 35% of HAP cases are caused by gram-negative bacilli, and the panel agreed this dictates that all empiric regimens target P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli; the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Regarding whether to use one or 2 antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa, the panel concluded that HAP patients with factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, including Pseudomonas, or increased risk for mortality should receive antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas patients without these factors should receive only one such antibiotic. A high risk for mortality was defined as requiring ventilatory support due to pneumonia and having septic shock.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^115wCJ11]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

### Does empirical therapy with a fluoroquinolone or the combination of a β-lactam plus a macrolide result in better outcomes for patients admitted to the general ward? [^114NHZbY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide, in particular among older patients and those with significant comorbid conditions. Current guidelines recommend therapy with a fluoroquinolone or a β-lactam plus a macrolide for the treatment of hospitalized adults with CAP who do not require admission to an intensive care unit. This article provides a brief summary and overview of the existing literature on this topic categorized by the main results; the potential implications for future clinical practice and research are discussed.

### Treatment guidelines and outcomes of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia [^114j8hK1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia is the second most frequent nosocomial infection and the first in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost. In recent years, international societies and, most recently, the American Thoracic Society jointly with the Infectious Disease Society of America, have developed guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-associated pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. These guidelines include recommendations for risk stratification, initial and definitive antibiotic treatment, and prevention. The validation of these guidelines is important because it confirms that they can be used in clinical practice, as quality indicators, and as a standard of care. Several processes can be validated and are included in the guidelines, such as the accuracy of the prediction of microorganisms according to stratification criteria and the impact of guidelines on outcomes, including length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, complications, and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Clinical studies have shown that the accuracy of predicting microorganisms according to risk stratification is reliable (approximately 80% and approximately 90%). Three studies suggest that the implementation of guidelines, with a special emphasis on antibiotic treatment, improves several parameters of outcome. Only one study, using a before-and-after design, showed a decrease in 14-day mortality after guidelines implementation. A key issue for these studies is to modify recommendations according to local patterns of microbiology and drug resistance. In summary, implementation of guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia decreases the rate of initial inappropriate antibiotic treatment and decreased 14-day mortality in a study. More clinical studies to validate the influence of guidelines on outcome are warranted.

### Update of the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU [^1178faRV]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

In accordance with the recommendations of, amongst others, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the recently published European treatment guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), in the event of a patient with such infections, empirical antibiotic treatment must be appropriate and administered as early as possible. The aim of this manuscript is to update treatment protocols by reviewing recently published studies on the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill patients that require invasive respiratory support and patients with HAP from hospital wards that require invasive mechanical ventilation. An interdisciplinary group of experts, comprising specialists in anaesthesia and resuscitation and in intensive care medicine, updated the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance and established clinical management priorities based on patients' risk factors. Implementation of rapid diagnostic microbiological techniques available and the new antibiotics recently added to the therapeutic arsenal has been reviewed and updated. After analysis of the categories outlined, some recommendations were suggested, and an algorithm to update empirical and targeted treatment in critically ill patients has also been designed. These aspects are key to improve VAP outcomes because of the severity of patients and possible acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — 2016 executive summary states that the term HAP "denotes an episode of pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation", and that patients with HAP and VAP "belong to 2 distinct groups". Compared with 2005, changes include use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, removal of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and "the recommendation that each hospital generate antibiograms to guide healthcare professionals with respect to the optimal choice of antibiotics". To minimize unnecessary antibiotics and resistance, the panel states "we recommend that the antibiogram data be utilized to decrease the unnecessary use of dual gram-negative and empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) antibiotic treatment", and "We also recommend short-course antibiotic therapy for most patients with HAP or VAP independent of microbial etiology, as well as antibiotic de-escalation".

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115WEwym]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are reviewed.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^115xQSYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^116ch7Ln]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians focuses on critical issues concerning the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED)with community-acquired pneumonia. It is an update of the 2001 clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of adult patients presenting to the ED with community-acquired pneumonia. A subcommittee reviewed the current literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help answer the following questions: (1) Are routine blood cultures indicated in patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia? (2) In adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia without severe sepsis, is there a benefit in mortality or morbidity from the administration of antibiotics within aspecific time course? The evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of evidence.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for pneumonia: the INSPIRE randomized clinical trial [^1177EUQF]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pneumonia is the most common infection requiring hospitalization and is a major reason for overuse of extended-spectrum antibiotics. Despite low risk of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection, clinical uncertainty often drives initial antibiotic selection. Strategies to limit empiric antibiotic overuse for patients with pneumonia are needed.

Objective

To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts providing patient- and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for non-critically ill patients admitted with pneumonia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cluster-randomized trial in 59 US community hospitals comparing the effect of a CPOE stewardship bundle (education, feedback, and real-time MDRO risk-based CPOE prompts; n = 29 hospitals) vs routine stewardship (n = 30 hospitals) on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in non-critically ill adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized with pneumonia. There was an 18-month baseline period from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018, and a 15-month intervention period from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020.

Intervention

CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period who have low estimated absolute risk (< 10%) of MDRO pneumonia, coupled with feedback and education.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was empiric (first 3 days of hospitalization) extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included empiric vancomycin and antipseudomonal days of therapy and safety outcomes included days to intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies.

Results

Among 59 hospitals with 96 451 (51 671 in the baseline period and 44 780 in the intervention period) adult patients admitted with pneumonia, the mean (SD) age of patients was 68.1 (17.0) years, 48.1% were men, and the median (IQR) Elixhauser comorbidity count was 4 (2–6). Compared with routine stewardship, the group using CPOE prompts had a 28.4% reduction in empiric extended-spectrum days of therapy (rate ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.66–0.78]; P < .001). Safety outcomes of mean days to ICU transfer (6.5 vs 7.1 days) and hospital length of stay (6.8 vs 7.1 days) did not differ significantly between the routine and CPOE intervention groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic use was significantly lower among adults admitted with pneumonia to non-ICU settings in hospitals using education, feedback, and CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics for patients at low risk of MDRO infection, compared with routine stewardship practices. Hospital length of stay and days to ICU transfer were unchanged.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1174pxsj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113tR9LR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized trial [^11585mQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 d. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications.

Objective

To assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In a randomized intervention trial, 302 consecutive patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were included. Data were assessed at baseline, after 4, 6, and 8 d, and after 6 wk. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. In the procalcitonin group (n = 151), antibiotic treatment was based on serum procalcitonin concentrations as follows: strongly discouraged, less than 0.1 microg/L; discouraged, less than 0.25 microg/L; encouraged, greater than 0.25 microg/L; strongly encouraged, greater than 0.5 microg/L. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use; secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcome.

Results

At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 d; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. After adjustment for Pneumonia Severity Index, the hazard ratio of antibiotic discontinuation was higher in the procalcitonin group than in the control group (3.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 4.2). Outcome was similar in both groups, with an overall success rate of 83%.

Conclusions

Procalcitonin guidance substantially reduces antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia. These findings may have important clinical and public health implications.

### Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia: guidelines [^111FaZF8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Two recent major guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recommend consideration of local antibiotic resistance patterns and individual patient risks for resistant pathogens when formulating an initial empiric antibiotic regimen. One recommends against invasive diagnostic techniques with quantitative cultures to determine the cause of VAP; the other recommends either invasive or noninvasive techniques. Both guidelines recommend short-course therapy be used for most patients with VAP. Although neither guideline recommends use of procalcitonin as an adjunct to clinical judgment when diagnosing VAP, they differ with respect to use of serial procalcitonin to shorten the length of antibiotic treatment.

### Amoxicillin for 3 or 5 days for chest-indrawing pneumonia in Malawian children [^114J7VCE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 920,000 children die before age 5 from pneumonia annually. There is a critical need to provide greater access to appropriate and effective treatment. Treatment of bacterial pneumonia requires an effective antibiotic used in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. Determining optimal duration of antibiotic therapy is key to ensuring effective treatment while maximizing adherence and minimizing adverse drug effects, costs, and antimicrobial resistance.

A 5-day course of oral amoxicillin at least 40mg/kg/dose twice-daily (80mg/kg/day) is recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment for chestindrawing pneumonia among immune-competent children < 5 years old. However, it is unclear whether a 5-day course of amoxicillin is necessary or if a shorter duration of treatment would be as effective. Based on studies of 3-versus 5-day oral antibiotics for fast-breathing pneumonia, WHO recommends a 3-day course of oral amoxicillin for treatment of fast-breathing pneumonia among immune-competent children < 5 years old.- A Cochrane review found no qualifying randomized controlled trials comparing 2-3versus 5-day intravenous antibiotics for chest-indrawing or more severe pneumonia. Few data exist to inform optimal duration of treatment for pneumonia, and no study has looked at 3-versus 5-day oral antibiotics for chest-indrawing pneumonia. International and national pneumonia treatment guidelines rely on expert opinion and limited and weak evidence. In light of the global threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance, evidence-based recommendations are needed for the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. Given the paucity of African data, African-specific research in malaria-endemic settings is critical to establish optimal management of children with chest-indrawing pneumonia.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^113u4pih]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) versus methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) coverage is guided by on-admission risk factors and mortality risk. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known), or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA; when empiric coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, and oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for the treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for empiric coverage of HAP if one of the above agents is used (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA was chosen in an effort to balance the need for effective initial antibiotic therapy against the risks of excessive antibiotic use; when implementing these recommendations, individual units may elect to modify this threshold.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^115RN9BE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

The NICE Guideline contains 27 recommendations, of which 3 relate to hospital acquired pneumonia, one to lower respiratory tract infections including CAP and 23 specifically to CAP. The BTS Guideline contains 137 recommendations, all relating specifically to CAP. Of these 137 recommendations, 36 overlapped with NICE Guideline recommendations. Major differences with the NICE Guideline were considered to exist for only five BTS recommendations (see table 1).

Table 1
BTS Guideline recommendations that overlap with NICE Guideline recommendations where major differences exist

In particular, no major differences were noted in the recommendations pertaining to the key aspects of the management of CAP: severity assessment, antibiotic choice and timeliness of treatment. Both guidelines recommend the use of:
clinical judgement in conjunction with the CURB-65 score (CRB65 score for primary care) to assess illness severity,
a single antibiotic as initial empirical therapy in patients with low severity CAP,
dual combination antibiotics comprising amoxicillin and a macrolide for patients with moderate severity CAP, and
dual combination antibiotics comprising a β-lactamase stable β-lactam (such as co-amoxiclav) and a macrolide for patients with high severity CAP.

In addition, both guidelines recommend that processes are be put in place to allow the radiological diagnosis and treatment of patients with CAP within 4 h of presentation to hospital.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^115H89mJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

### Impact of antibiotic restrictions: the physician's perspective [^11363Q43]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

In recent years, there have been worldwide efforts to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. This has mainly been in response to mounting concerns about the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Surprisingly, there has been little systematic investigation of the impact of antibiotic restrictions on the complications of infection. It is difficult to address this question using randomised clinical trials in light of the often limited numbers of patients that can be included, who are also often atypical of the broad population of patients receiving antibiotic therapy. Observational data from the UK indicate an association between recent reductions in antibiotic prescribing for lower respiratory tract infection in general practice and an increase in pneumonia mortality. These studies suggest a need for further investigations examining the changing patterns of antibiotic prescribing and their effects on patient outcomes in other countries and in other common infectious diseases. Such studies may provide a useful comparison with the changes observed in lower respiratory tract infection in the UK, and could help to improve antibiotic prescribing practices worldwide. It is also important to study whether associated worse outcomes are limited to certain at-risk groups who should be targeted for care.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — antipseudomonal strategy and agents to avoid: We suggest prescribing 2 antipseudomonal antibiotics from different classes for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP only in patients with any of the following: a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance (Table 2), patients in units where > 10% of gram-negative isolates are resistant to an agent being considered for monotherapy, and patients in an ICU where local antimicrobial susceptibility rates are not available (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest prescribing one antibiotic active against P. aeruginosa for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP in patients without risk factors for antimicrobial resistance who are being treated in ICUs where < 10% of gram-negative isolates are resistant to the agent being considered for monotherapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with suspected VAP, we suggest avoiding aminoglycosides if alternative agents with adequate gram-negative activity are available (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we suggest avoiding colistin if alternative agents with adequate gram-negative activity are available (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

### The controversy of combination vs monotherapy in the treatment of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^111U9tfC]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients (about 80%) will be treated as outpatients, because therapy with a single agent will work. For the remaining 20% of patients requiring hospitalization, there is some growing debate regarding the efficacy of different management approaches. For hospitalized patients, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone agent seems to be gaining popularity, but dual therapy combining a beta-lactam and an advanced macrolide still represents a good choice. Indeed, this regimen was recommended for all of the inpatient categories in the latest Infectious Disease Society of America CAP guidelines in 2003.

Aim

The purpose of this review was to examine the current clinical evidence to support one option or the other by gathering all of the available published literature. We will review the existing controversies in terms of microbiology, immunology, and clinical outcomes comparing dual therapy (ie, with any combination of beta-lactams, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones) with monotherapy in the treatment of CAP.

Results

For the vast majority of patients with CAP (ie, outpatients and inpatients on medical wards), the type of antibiotic regimen prescribed does not have any significant impact. For patients with severe pneumonia, for which there is no accepted definition so far, the controversy remains alive. Mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia has been reduced over the last decades, but despite improved medical care, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is still as lethal as ever, probably because of the aging population, the greater number of immunocompromised patients, and the number of patients with frequent comorbid conditions. Worldwide, the increasing rates of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics are also a serious concern, and the clinical implications are not always obvious. Although limited in number, the four studies showing the importance of adding a macrolide to a beta-lactam regimen for the treatment of bacteremic S pneumoniae pneumonia are retrospective and nonblinded, the findings are consistent, and they point to a trend that has to be explored more thoroughly. Studies published in the last few years suggest that combination therapy may be superior for bacteremic S pneumoniae pneumonia.

Conclusion

In the meantime, for practical purposes, patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe CAP may benefit from a dual antibiotic therapy combining a third-generation cephalosporin and a macrolide. For the majority of hospitalized patients with CAP who are not severely ill, fluoroquinolone monotherapy remains an approved, tested, and reliable option. Indeed, the time for more aggressive outpatient fluoroquinolone therapy may reduce the number of patients who are hospitalized with CAP. Independent prospective studies comparing combination therapy with standard monotherapy are urgently required for hospitalized patients with severe CAP.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

Diagnostic testing and antibiotics are not routinely recommended for young children with community-acquired pneumonia. In a national sample of > 6 million outpatient 1- to 6-year-olds with community-acquired pneumonia between 2008 and 2015, a complete blood count was obtained for 8.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1%-11.1%), radiography was performed for 43% (95% CI, 36%-50%), and antibiotics were given for 73.9% (95% CI, 67.1%-80.7%). There were no changes in testing or antibiotic use over time.

### Childhood community-acquired pneumonia: a review of etiology-and antimicrobial treatment studies [^115CpSnP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity worldwide. Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^117V1x89]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — S. aureus coverage and MRSA/MSSA selection is as follows: For patients being treated empirically for HAP, we recommend prescribing an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have either a risk factor for MRSA infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, or the prevalence of MRSA is not known, or who are at high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MRSA (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. For patients with HAP who require empiric coverage for MRSA, we recommend vancomycin or linezolid rather than an alternative antibiotic (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality, we suggest prescribing an antibiotic with activity against MSSA, and when empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem.

### Antibiotic treatment for pneumonia complicating stroke: recommendations from the pneumonia in stroke consensus (PISCES) group [^113gptdE]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The microbiological aetiology of pneumonia complicating stroke is poorly characterised. In this second Pneumonia in Stroke ConsEnsuS statement, we propose a standardised approach to empirical antibiotic therapy in pneumonia complicating stroke, based on likely microbiological aetiology, to improve antibiotic stewardship.

Methods

Systematic literature searches of multiple databases were undertaken. An evidence review and a round of consensus consultation were completed prior to a final multi-disciplinary consensus meeting in September 2017, held in Barcelona, Spain. Consensus was approached using a modified Delphi technique and defined a priori as 75% agreement between the consensus group members. Findings: No randomised trials to guide antibiotic treatment of pneumonia complicating stroke were identified. Consensus was reached for the following: (1) Stroke-associated pneumonia may be caused by organisms associated with either community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia; (2) Treatment for early stroke-associated pneumonia (< 72 h of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms; (3) Treatment for late stroke-associated pneumonia (≥ 72 h and within seven days of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms plus coliforms ± Pseudomonas spp. if risk factors; (4) No additional antimicrobial cover is required for patients with dysphagia or aspiration; (5) Pneumonia occurring after seven days from stroke onset should be treated as for hospital-acquired pneumonia; (6) Treatment should continue for at least seven days for each of these scenarios.

Discussion

Consensus recommendations for antibiotic treatment of the spectrum of pneumonia complicating stroke are proposed. However, there was limited evidence available to formulate consensus on choice of specific antibiotic class for pneumonia complicating stroke.

Conclusion

Further studies are required to inform evidence-based treatment of stroke-associated pneumonia including randomised trials of antibiotics and validation of candidate biomarkers.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.
