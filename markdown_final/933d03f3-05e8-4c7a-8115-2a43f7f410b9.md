## Question

I have 5% body fat and I've never struggled with snoring before, but I am now taking testosterone and Benadryl and trazodone to sleep. What would the next step in my work up and treatment be

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next steps in evaluation and management are for new-onset snoring after starting testosterone, diphenhydramine, and trazodone in a person with very low body fat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which medication(s) plausibly precipitate or exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing, with a special focus on testosterone's known effects. Then, I should verify immediate medication changes that reduce respiratory risk at night. Next, I will screen and objectively evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea, while considering central events. After that, I need to examine the implications of extremely low body fat on airway tone and overall endocrine status. Finally, I will address testosterone management, outline evidence-based sleep treatment, coordinate referrals, and set up a monitoring timeline, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and labeling where possible [^112SrdSh] [^113jun74].

> Let me first confirm the primary concern and temporal association. New-onset snoring arising after initiation of testosterone, diphenhydramine, and trazodone raises the possibility of medication-exacerbated sleep-disordered breathing, and importantly, FDA labeling for multiple testosterone products warns that treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea, so I should flag testosterone as a high-priority contributor until proven otherwise [^112SrdSh] [^114LyxL1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sleep medicines as "harmless aids" for this case. I initially thought that continuing trazodone could be reasonable for insomnia because it is commonly used off-label; wait, let me verify guideline direction here because off-label use does not equal best practice, and the VA/DoD 2025 guideline explicitly recommends avoiding trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder, which means I should not rely on it in this patient with suspected sleep-disordered breathing and new snoring, and I should also be cautious about diphenhydramine's sedative and anticholinergic effects that may reduce upper airway muscle tone at night and worsen next-day function, particularly when safer, evidence-based options exist [^1115Mv1c].

> I need to ensure we screen for obstructive sleep apnea systematically rather than rely only on symptom impressions. The VA/DoD guideline advises considering OSA screening in patients with sleep complaints, and I should use validated instruments such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for daytime sleepiness and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to profile sleep quality and disturbances, while also querying for witnessed apneas, gasping, nocturnal choking, and morning headaches before proceeding to diagnostic testing [^113jun74] [^1151WAYn] [^112o12Vg].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup logic and avoid over-reliance on screening alone. Objective testing with a home sleep apnea test or in-laboratory polysomnography is needed to confirm presence and severity, and to differentiate obstructive from potential central events given the medication context; concurrently, I need to check labs pertinent to testosterone therapy monitoring and cardiometabolic risk, including serum testosterone and hematocrit, because TRT programs recommend serial monitoring for safety and efficacy, which fits here as we link symptoms to therapy timing [^113jun74] [^117KbkG9].

> But wait, what if the very low body fat is a clue beyond cardiometabolic status. Five percent body fat is at the borderline of essential fat for men and may reflect overtraining, energy deficiency, or other endocrine or nutritional issues that could reduce upper airway muscle bulk and tone, paradoxically facilitating collapsibility; I should confirm with nutritional assessment and endocrine evaluation, and counsel within a shared decision-making framework about broader health goals while we simultaneously address sleep-disordered breathing and therapy risks [^117ApyTm].

> I will now examine testosterone therapy itself, and I must not stop it abruptly without context. I should confirm the indication and dosing, then consider switching to a preparation that allows finer titration if adverse effects emerge; gels are recommended by the EAU for initial treatment to allow easier adjustment or discontinuation when treatment-related adverse effects occur, and I should explicitly educate that testosterone can potentiate sleep apnea and therefore requires active monitoring of sleep symptoms and objective sleep data if OSA is suspected or confirmed [^113W9sZx] [^112SrdSh].

> Let me think about evidence-based sleep treatment contingent on diagnostic confirmation. If OSA is confirmed, positive airway pressure therapy remains the standard first-line approach with adjuncts such as positional therapy for supine-predominant disease, while I avoid sedatives that can further depress upper airway tone; in parallel, if nocturia or related symptoms are present, referral for CPAP assessment is aligned with urological guidance that recognizes OSA contributions to nocturnal symptoms [^113jun74] [^112zJqzv].

> If insomnia persists after effective OSA treatment and adequate PAP adherence, I should double-check that I am not reflexively reaching for sedatives; CBT-I is the first-line therapy per VA/DoD guidance, and if a hypnotic is ever considered, I need to re-evaluate for co-morbid conditions and respiratory status because several FDA-labeled hypnotics caution to assess for underlying medical contributors and to be vigilant for complex sleep behaviors and respiratory considerations in vulnerable patients [^113jun74] [^112fPUQR] [^113bygcR] [^111ZLjss].

> Next, I should review appropriate referrals since this is clearly multidisciplinary. Sleep medicine should guide testing and PAP titration, endocrinology should co-manage TRT and evaluate the low body fat and any endocrine contributors, nutrition should address energy balance and body composition targets safely, and mental health should be engaged if screening suggests disordered eating or body image concerns, all within a shared decision-making framework that integrates risks, benefits, and patient preferences [^113jun74] [^117ApyTm].

> Finally, I need to ensure a concrete monitoring and follow-up plan that I can defend. Short term, I would reassess sleep symptoms after stopping trazodone and diphenhydramine and after completing screening within 4–6 weeks; medium term, I would review sleep study results, PAP adherence, and symptom response by about three months; long term, I would monitor body composition, TRT parameters including serum testosterone and hematocrit, and sleep quality metrics every 6–12 months in alignment with TRT monitoring recommendations and sleep guidelines, adjusting testosterone dosing or formulation if OSA status or adverse effects dictate [^117KbkG9] [^113jun74].

The next step is to **stop Benadryl and trazodone immediately** [^1115Mv1c] because they can cause or worsen snoring and sleep apnea by relaxing upper airway muscles and depressing respiration [^115hZBWp]. Then, **order a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) or polysomnography** to assess for obstructive sleep apnea, which can be triggered or unmasked by testosterone therapy even in lean patients [^112SrdSh]. If OSA is confirmed, initiate CPAP therapy [^113jun74] and reassess testosterone use [^113W9sZx]; if OSA is not present, consider alternative non-sedating sleep aids or behavioral strategies [^1115Mv1c].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic workup

### Step 1: immediate medication review and adjustment

During the immediate medication review, **discontinue Benadryl and trazodone** [^1115Mv1c], as both can cause or worsen snoring and sleep apnea by relaxing upper airway muscles and depressing respiratory drive [^115hZBWp]. Consider **alternative sleep aids** such as melatonin or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).

---

### Step 2: clinical assessment and screening

Obtain a **detailed sleep history** — including the onset, duration, and severity of snoring; daytime sleepiness; and witnessed apneas — and use **validated questionnaires** [^113jun74] such as STOP-Bang or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

---

### Step 3: objective sleep testing

For objective testing, a **home sleep apnea test (HSAT)** is appropriate to evaluate for OSA given the recent-onset snoring and testosterone use; if HSAT results are inconclusive or central sleep apnea is suspected, proceed with in-laboratory **polysomnography (PSG)**.

---

## Potential mechanisms linking testosterone therapy to snoring

Testosterone therapy can contribute to **snoring and sleep-disordered breathing** via several mechanisms [^112SrdSh]:

- **Upper airway muscle relaxation**: Testosterone may increase upper airway collapsibility, leading to obstruction during sleep.

- **Fluid retention**: Testosterone-induced fluid retention can cause upper airway edema, narrowing the airway and increasing snoring risk [^114LyxL1].

- **Weight gain**: Although the patient currently has low body fat, testosterone therapy can lead to increased muscle mass and potential weight gain, further contributing to airway obstruction [^117KbkG9].

---

## Management strategies

### Step 4: management of confirmed obstructive sleep apnea

If **OSA is confirmed** on objective testing, implement the following management strategies:

- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**: CPAP therapy is the gold standard treatment for OSA and should be initiated promptly.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Encourage weight maintenance, regular exercise, and avoidance of alcohol or sedating medications before bedtime [^115hZBWp].

- **Reevaluation of testosterone therapy**: Consider adjusting or discontinuing testosterone therapy if it significantly contributes to OSA severity [^113W9sZx].

---

### Step 5: follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, schedule **regular follow-up** appointments to monitor sleep quality, adherence to CPAP therapy, and testosterone levels [^117KbkG9]. Provide **patient education** about the potential risks associated with testosterone therapy and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan [^117ApyTm].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Discontinue Benadryl and trazodone | Medications can exacerbate snoring and sleep apnea [^115hZBWp] |
| 2 | Conduct clinical assessment and screening | Identify risk factors and symptoms of OSA [^113jun74] |
| 3 | Perform HSAT or PSG | Objective diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing [^115CMkHn] |
| 4 | Initiate CPAP therapy if OSA confirmed | Gold standard treatment for OSA [^113jun74] |
| 5 | Reevaluate testosterone therapy | Adjust or discontinue if contributing to OSA [^112SrdSh] |
| 6 | Regular follow-up and monitoring | Ensure adherence and monitor treatment effectiveness [^117KbkG9] |

---

The next step in the evaluation and treatment of new-onset snoring in a patient with 5% body fat taking testosterone, Benadryl, and trazodone is to **discontinue Benadryl and trazodone**, conduct a clinical assessment, and **perform objective sleep testing** to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea [^115CMkHn]. If OSA is confirmed, initiate CPAP therapy and reevaluate testosterone therapy [^112SrdSh].

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^113K9yBF]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the recognition of children with OSDB needing treatment: Two expert recommendations published in 2023 identify a group of children with a history and clinical examination consistent with OSDB who can be treated without the need for overnight recording.

A French consensus focused on recommendations for children with "OSDB type 1", defined as occurring in young, non-obese children with no associated comorbidities, where OSDB is generally due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The experts conclude that significant OSDB-1 is suspected when several nighttime respiratory symptoms related to upper airway obstruction are present in the clinical history. They emphasize that "the diagnosis is above all clinical and OSA severity should also be evaluated on the basis of all the clinical signs". A specialized otolaryngologist examination is considered essential.

They further state that questionnaires can be used to collect clinical history, especially by non-experts. Hence, a score less than 0.3 on the Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder Scale of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire has good predictive value for mild OSA with potential spontaneous normalization, allowing for watchful waiting. Conversely, a score greater than 2.72 on the Spruyt and Gozal Severity Questionnaire indicates a high likelihood of moderate OSA (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 81%) and suggests that treatment should be considered. In addition, it is stated that a sleep study is not mandatory before surgery for a child with OSDB-1 if at least two nighttime symptoms (including snoring) and significant tonsillar hypertrophy are observed.

### Atrial fibrillation and semaglutide effects in obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: STEP-HFpEF program [^116EqHdD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Obesity is a key factor in the development and progression of both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). In the STEP-HFpEF program, comprising the STEP-HFpEF (Research Study to Investigate How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure and Obesity) and STEP-HFpEF DM (Research Study to Look at How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure, Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes) trials, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg improved HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function, and reduced body weight in patients with obesity-related HFpEF. Whether the effects of semaglutide in this patient group differ in participants with and without AF (and across various AF types) has not been fully examined.

- **Objectives**: The goals of this study were: 1) to evaluate baseline characteristics and clinical features of patients with obesity-related HFpEF with and without a history of AF; and 2) to determine if the efficacy of semaglutide across all key trial outcomes is influenced by the baseline history of AF (and AF types) in the STEP-HFpEF program.

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of pooled data from the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials. Patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m², and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) < 90 points were randomized 1:1 to receive once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo for 52 weeks. Dual primary endpoints included change in KCCQ-CSS and percent change in body weight.

### The whimsical nature of airway obstruction during drug-induced sleep endoscopy [^111nDWy5]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old male patient diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) sought alternatives to positive airway pressure, prompting evaluation with drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). He underwent a specialized DISE with nasal airflow and pharyngeal pressure monitoring. During obstructive apneas, airflow and pressure signals demonstrated dynamic, multilevel upper airway collapse, with shifting sites of airflow obstruction as respiratory effort increased. This case report illustrates how quantitative airflow and pressure measurements can complement the standard DISE exam and aid in surgical decision-making.

### Trazodone rescues dysregulated synaptic and mitochondrial nascent proteomes in prion neurodegeneration [^1116RsJk]. Brain (2024). High credibility.

Trazodone treatment restores synapse and mitochondrial numbers and function in prion disease.

- **Scanning electron microscopy analysis**: Representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images from (i) control [normal brain homogenate (NBH)], (ii) prion, and (iii) prion + trazodone mice from CA1 stratum radiatum are shown. Dendrites are pseudo-colored in yellow and axons in green. Synapse number quantification of the hippocampal CA1 neuropil shows a decrease in prion disease (orange bars) and partial but significant restoration with trazodone treatment (green bars).

- **Mitochondrial number and function**: Representative SEM images from (i) control (NBH), (ii) prion, and (iii) prion + trazodone from CA1 pyramidal neuron somata are presented, with mitochondria perimeters colored in pink. The numbers of mitochondria per neuron are reduced in prion disease (orange bars) and restored to wild-type levels with trazodone treatment (green bars). Additionally, the number of mitochondria within synapses increases with trazodone treatment.

- **Protein restoration insights**: Immunoblots and quantification (bar graph, right) of oxidative phosphorylation proteins (I, II, III, IV, and V) demonstrate restoration with trazodone treatment.

- **Mitochondrial stress test results**: A mitochondrial stress test on isolated mitochondria from control (NBH), prion, and prion + trazodone treatment groups at 10 weeks post-inoculation (wpi) was conducted, showing oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) from 0 to 65 minutes. Time points of stressor addition (ADP, oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone + antimycin A, respectively) are labeled. Basal respiration was defined as the (initial) OCR value minus the (rotenone + antimycin A) OCR value; maximal respiratory capacity was defined as the specific OCR value.

### The prevalence of central sleep apnea in new referrals to a sleep surgery clinic [^115W35BM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

As home sleep study testing and referrals to sleep surgery clinics have increased, particularly in older patients since the advent of hypoglossal nerve stimulation, all providers should be aware of the possibility of patients with CSA (i.e. not isolated OSA) being referred. The percentage of such "incorrect" referrals has not been previously studied nor reported. As such, the goal of the present manuscript was to comprehensively evaluate a prospective sample referred to a sleep surgery clinic for the presence of clinically significant CSA, defined as having > 25% central or mixed events, and to assess specific characteristics of these patients.

### Men, testosterone and Covid-19 [^116N6ASD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Men have more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outcomes and higher mortality rates than women, leading to suggestions that testosterone levels might promote severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Covid-19 severity. However, clinical studies have not supported this theory. Studies have consistently shown that serum testosterone concentrations during acute Covid-19 in men are inversely proportional to the inflammatory cytokines and severity of illness. It is likely that lower testosterone concentrations in this setting result from the impact of acute Covid-19 illness on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Clinical trials that attempted to lower testosterone concentrations further or block androgen signaling acutely during Covid-19 in men did not result in improved Covid-19 outcomes. Additionally, pre-existing male hypogonadism, diagnosed before the Covid-19 pandemic, was found to be a risk factor for hospitalization from Covid-19.

In this review, we also discuss the preclinical and mechanistic studies that have evaluated the role of androgens in SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. Finally, the long-term consequences of Covid-19 on male reproductive health are reviewed. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to infiltrate the testis and induce orchitis in men, but it is unclear if Covid-19 leads to an increase in the incidence of male hypogonadism.

### Cobenfy [^1119Hkae]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In clinical studies with Cobenfy, transient increases in liver enzymes with rapid decline occurred, consistent with transient biliary obstruction due to biliary contraction and possible gallstone passage [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cobenfy is not recommended for patients with active biliary disease such as symptomatic gallstones. Assess liver enzymes and bilirubin prior to initiating Cobenfy and as clinically indicated during treatment. The occurrence of symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, or upper abdominal pain should prompt assessment for gallbladder disorders, biliary disorders, and pancreatitis, as clinically indicated.

Discontinue Cobenfy in the presence of signs or symptoms of substantial liver injury such as jaundice, pruritus, or alanine aminotransferase levels more than five times the upper limit of normal or five times baseline values.

- **Decreased gastrointestinal motility**: Cobenfy contains trospium chloride. Trospium chloride, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility. Administer Cobenfy with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Use Cobenfy with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis.

- **Risk of angioedema**: Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with Cobenfy and trospium chloride, a component of Cobenfy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In one case, angioedema occurred after administration.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^117KbkG9]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistently low serum testosterone levels alongside symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk.

After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment should consider patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

### Arakoda [^111h7Ctp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Methemoglobinemia**: Asymptomatic elevations in methemoglobin have been observed in the clinical trials of Arakoda [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Institute appropriate therapy if signs or symptoms of methemoglobinemia occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Carefully monitor individuals with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent methemoglobin reductase deficiency. Advise patients to discontinue Arakoda and seek medical attention if signs of methemoglobinemia occur.

- **Psychiatric effects**: In patients receiving Arakoda in clinical trials, psychiatric adverse reactions included sleep disturbances (2.5%), depression/depressed mood (0.3%), and anxiety (0.2%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Arakoda was discontinued in a subject with an adverse reaction of suicide attempt (0.1%). Subjects with a history of psychiatric disorders were excluded from three of five Arakoda trials in which mefloquine was included as a comparator.

	- Psychosis was reported in three patients with a history of psychosis or schizophrenia who received tafenoquine doses (350 mg to 500 mg single dose, or 400 mg daily for 3 days) different from the approved Arakoda regimen. Safety and effectiveness of Arakoda have not been established at doses or regimens other than the approved regimen; use of Arakoda at doses or regimens other than a 200-mg weekly dose is not approved by the FDA.

	- Arakoda is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychotic disorders or psychotic symptoms [see Contraindication (4)]. If psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, or grossly disorganized thinking) occur, discontinue use immediately.

### Effect of midazolam co-administered with oxycodone on ventilation: A randomised clinical trial in healthy volunteers [^113UEqVu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, although midazolam co-administered with oxycodone did not further decrease hypercapnic ventilation compared with oxycodone alone, it decreased tidal volume, increased ventilatory frequency, and increased resting end-tidal P2 in healthy subjects, which suggests that the combination influences ventilation by inducing relaxation of the respiratory muscles. This is an important foundation for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, additional investigations are necessary to elucidate the potential for upper airway obstruction when benzodiazepines and oxycodone are co-administered, especially in at-risk populations.

### The Pittsburgh sleep quality index: a brief review [^112o12Vg]. Occupational Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19-item self-report questionnaire comprising both fixed-choice and open-ended questions to evaluate several aspects of sleep over the past month. These aspects include perceived sleep quality, sleep habits (e.g. habitual bedtimes and wake times), and sleep disturbances (e.g. difficulty falling asleep, disordered breathing, nightmares, and pain).

Five additional questions, rated by a habitual bed partner, assess aspects of sleep that are difficult to self-report, such as loud snoring, pauses in breathing, legs twitching, and disorientation during sleep. These additional questions may be administered for clinical assessment but are not included in the scoring.

A dedicated scoring procedure, described in the original validation study, yields scores for seven distinct components: (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbances, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. Component scores range from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty), and their sum produces a global score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher values on this scale indicate poorer sleep quality. A PSQI score greater than 5 is considered indicative of poor sleep quality, based on its high sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with sleep complaints.

The appendix of Buysse et al.'s study includes the PSQI item format and scoring sheet. These, along with detailed guidelines on the instrument's use, are also accessible via the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Sleep and Circadian Science website.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^1138Ekyn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of oSDB is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the AHI, which, according to official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is "neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity".

An important publication by Solano-Pérez E et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children. There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypopneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently. This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypopneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long-term consequences of pediatric OSA, such as cardiovascular disease. As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences.

### Dayvigo [^113bygcR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients and their families that Dayvigo may cause sleep paralysis, which is an inability to move or speak for several minutes during sleep-wake transitions, despite being aware of surroundings; hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including vivid and disturbing perceptions; and symptoms similar to mild cataplexy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Complex sleep behaviors**: Instruct patients and their families that Dayvigo may cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex while not being fully awake. Tell patients to discontinue Dayvigo and notify their healthcare provider immediately if they develop any of these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Worsening of depression/suicidal ideation**: Tell patients to report any worsening of depression or suicidal thoughts immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Pregnancy**: Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Dayvigo during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Concomitant medications**: Ask patients about alcohol consumption, medicines they are taking, and drugs they may be taking without a prescription. Advise patients not to consume alcohol in combination with Dayvigo [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Tolerance, abuse, and dependence**: Tell patients not to increase the dose of Dayvigo on their own, and to inform you if they believe the drug "does not work" [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^113Vndc1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

From the perspective of medications and sleep, it should be recognized that narcolepsy therapy with stimulants may cause insomnia or difficulty sleeping, and some oxybate medications may require patients to wake from sleep in the early morning for repeat dosing. Both sodium oxybate and low-sodium oxybate require awakening from sleep for the second dose, disrupting sleep in people whose disorder is associated with sleep disruption. In this context, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved a single-dose, extended-release sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy; this medication has high sodium content similar to conventional, twice-nightly sodium oxybate. However, the single dose has the advantage of not requiring a second awakening. People with narcolepsy treated with oxybate have been reported to experience approximately 42 to 53 arousals and 9 to 38 awakenings each night. Although no studies have directly compared the effects of twice-nightly sodium oxybate or low-sodium oxybate with extended-release sodium oxybate, clinical trial data from the individual clinical development programs demonstrate that once-nightly and twice-nightly oxybate regimens are associated with similar improvements in sleep architecture, stage shifts, arousals or awakenings, and patient-reported sleep quality.

Clinicians should evaluate for and treat comorbid risk factors and conditions in collaboration with primary care, cardiology, endocrinology, and other relevant specialties. An interdisciplinary approach to reducing cardiovascular risk could include non-sleep specialists.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^113Lx4nn]. APA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for posttraumatic stress disorder, more specifically with respect to other medications, APA 2025 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against hypnotics (such as eszopiclone), MAOIs (such as brofaromine, phenelzine), norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (such as bupropion), serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (such as nefazodone), ganaxolone, nepicastat, orvepitant, or augmentation with D-cycloserine or eszopiclone in patients with PTSD.

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111yP91x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This guideline was developed to inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders regarding the management of persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) focusing on questions that address significant management issues. As the first guideline for children with persistent OSA, it also highlights known gaps in the literature to encourage further research in this area. These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care but to provide the basis for rational decisions in the management of persistent OSA in children.

Clinicians, patients, third-party payers, institutional review committees, and other stakeholders should not view these recommendations as dictates. No guidelines and recommendations can take into account all of the often-compelling unique individual clinical circumstances. Therefore, no one charged with evaluating clinicians' actions should attempt to apply the recommendations from these guidelines by rote or in a blanket fashion. Statements about the underlying values and preferences, as well as qualifying remarks accompanying each recommendation, are integral parts and serve to facilitate more accurate interpretation. They should never be omitted when quoting or translating recommendations from these guidelines.

It is debatable whether a single parameter can determine the severity of OSA. Nevertheless, obstructive apnea hypopnea index (oAHI) cutoffs from in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) are often used to dictate care. The oAHI corresponds to the sum of obstructive apneas, mixed apneas, and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time.

### Pre-morbid sleep disturbance and its association with stroke severity: Results from the international INTERSTROKE study [^113rGqMX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The INTERSTROKE study was a large case-control study that recruited participants with acute stroke and age/sex-matched controls from 32 countries between 2007 and 2015. Eligible stroke patients were those admitted to the hospital with a clinical diagnosis of first acute stroke, as defined by the World Health Organization, with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging available or planned within one week of presentation. Participants were recruited within 72 hours of hospital admission. A standardized questionnaire was administered by trained research staff, with clinical measurements (e.g. vital signs, anthropometric measurements) recorded at the time of interview and/or from the participant's notes. A valid proxy respondent (spouse or first-degree relative living in the same home or aware of the participant's medical history and therapies) was used for those unable to complete the questionnaire due to severe stroke and/or aphasia. For the analysis, a subset of participants (stroke cases) who completed a supplementary questionnaire that incorporated questions about sleep practices (n = 2361) was included. This questionnaire was introduced in July 2012 to consecutive participants at participating centers.

Participants (or a proxy respondent) were administered a series of standardized questions about sleep in the month prior to stroke, which have been described previously. In brief, information on nocturnal sleep duration, self-reported sleep quality, nocturnal awakening, sleep onset latency (SOL), and daytime sleeping habits was ascertained.

### Firmagon [^112yfwtP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Based on findings in animals and the mechanism of action, degarelix may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Firmagon, 82% were age 65 and over, while 42% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

- **Renal impairment**: No pharmacokinetic studies in renally impaired patients have been conducted. At least 20–30% of a given dose of degarelix is excreted unchanged in the urine. A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from the randomized study demonstrated that there is no significant effect of mild renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCL) 50–80 mL/min] on either the degarelix concentration or testosterone concentration. Data on patients with moderate or severe renal impairment are limited and therefore degarelix should be used with caution in patients with CrCL < 50 mL/min.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from the randomized trial. A single dose of 1 mg degarelix administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour was studied in 16 non-prostate cancer patients with either mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment compared to non-prostate cancer patients with normal hepatic function.

### Association between the triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and diabetes mellitus likelihood in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113BMHjK]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Trained physicians conducted in-person interviews using standardized questionnaires. The comprehensive assessment encompassed participants' demographics, socioeconomic status, dietary patterns, lifestyle factors, personal and family medical histories, substance use, physical activity, sleep characteristics, financial backgrounds, and educational histories. However, the dataset utilized in this secondary analysis lacked detailed information on these variables, representing a limitation of the available data source. All data collection procedures adhered to rigorous protocols and were executed by a team of specially trained healthcare professionals.

Anthropometric measurements, including height and weight, were recorded with participants in light clothing, barefoot, and without head coverings. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer, while weight was assessed to the nearest 0.1 kg with calibrated platform scales. Blood pressure was measured with a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer while participants were seated; two readings were taken, and the average of these readings was utilized for analysis. Smoking status was classified as 'never smokers' versus 'ever smokers' (or former). Alcohol intake was categorized as 'never drinkers' versus 'ever drinkers' (or former). Education level was stratified into two categories: middle school or below (≤ 9 years).

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115CMkHn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in medically hospitalized adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statement**: The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of hospitalized adults with sleep-disordered breathing: For medically hospitalized adults with an established diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing and on active treatment, existing treatment should be continued rather than withheld, unless contraindicated.

- **Recommendations**: The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in managing medically hospitalized adults with OSA. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("Strong" or "Conditional"). A "Strong" recommendation (i.e. "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "Conditional" recommendation…

### Vitrakvi [^1166h8Cw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dizziness occurred in 22% of patients, and Grade 3 dizziness occurred in 0.9% of patients. Among the 96 patients who experienced dizziness, 6% required a dose modification, and 5% required dose interruption.

Sleep disturbances occurred in 12% of patients, including insomnia (9%), somnolence (3.4%), and sleep disorder (0.5%). Grade 3 sleep disturbances occurred in 0.2% of patients. Among the 54 patients who experienced sleep disturbances, no patient required a dose modification, and 3.7% required dose interruption.

Advise patients and caretakers of these risks with Vitrakvi. Recommend that patients do not drive or operate hazardous machinery if experiencing neurologic adverse reactions. Withhold or permanently discontinue Vitrakvi based on severity. If withheld, modify the Vitrakvi dosage when resumed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Skeletal fractures**: Skeletal fractures can occur in patients taking Vitrakvi. Among 444 patients who received Vitrakvi across clinical trials, fractures occurred in 7% of patients; 6% of 290 adult patients and 10% of 154 pediatric patients. The median time to the first fracture was 13 months (range 27 days to 73 months) in patients followed for fractures. The most common fractures were of the rib (1.4%), fibula, foot, or wrist (0.7% each). Most fractures were associated with minimal or moderate trauma. Some were associated with radiologic abnormalities suggestive of local tumor involvement. Vitrakvi treatment was interrupted due to fracture in 1.4% of patients.

Promptly evaluate patients with significant symptoms.

### Orgovyx [^114vpRZP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Relugolix is a nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby reducing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and consequently testosterone.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Relugolix reduced LH, FSH [Figure 1], and testosterone concentrations after oral administration of the recommended loading dose of 360 mg and a 120 mg dose once daily. Out of 622 patients, 56% had testosterone concentrations at castrate levels (280 ng/dL) or baseline at 90 days was 55% [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (open-label moxifloxacin), parallel-group thorough QT/QTc study, no increase in mean QTc interval > 10 ms was identified after administration of a single 60 mg or 360 mg (0.2 or 1 times the recommended loading dose, respectively) relugolix dose.

### Prevalence and clinical aspects of obstructive sleep apnea in Parkinson disease: A meta-analysis [^116MfEUF]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common clinical features of Parkinson disease (PD), affecting nearly half of the patients and are linked to more severe PD clinical phenotypes such as cognitive dysfunctions, more severe neuropsychiatric manifestations, and reduced quality of life (QoL). Of these, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea, irregular breathing, sleep-related hypoventilation, and hypoxemia, frequently occur in PD, probably due to centrally mediated respiratory problems and upper airway dysfunction.

The overall prevalence of OSA in the general population ranges from 9% to 38% and is associated with older age, male sex, and a higher body mass index (BMI). Its occurrence has been related to detrimental clinical consequences such as impaired cognition and increased risk of cardiovascular events, which increase morbidity and mortality.

However, the prevalence of OSA in PD may be affected by its clinical onset, because it may precede PD diagnosis due to causative factors such as overweight and older age, or, in contrast, OSA may develop and worsen throughout the course of the disease due to PD-related factors and shared pathogenetic mechanisms. OSA presentation was found to be more frequent in PD patients with more severe motor disabilities that can also affect the upper airway musculature. Nevertheless, some evidence showed a possible protective role of dopaminergic therapy through the increase of nocturnal mobility that enables patients to reduce the supine sleep position.

### AmbienCR [^11121PYd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Need to evaluate for comorbid diagnoses**: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only following a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem.

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the throat, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug.

- **Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes**: Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative/hypnotics, including Ambien CR. Some of these changes included decreased inhibition (e.g. aggressiveness and extroversion) that seemed out of character.

### Diagnosis and management in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: First international consensus statement [^116Me7w4]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Hearing - **Otolaryngology and anaesthesiology**: The typical facial characteristics in individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RTS) include a small chin and small oral cavity, which can result in airway difficulties and, together with gastro-oesophageal reflux, can lead to complications like middle ear infections. Conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing loss may result. Regular auditory evaluation is therefore recommended.

- **Sleep**: Abnormal facial anatomy and increased collapsibility of the laryngeal walls predispose individuals with RTS to higher rates of sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep disorders are frequent in children and occur in 62% of adults. OSA is typically characterized by snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness and affects 25% of adults with RTS. If present in children, the facial anatomy is often markedly abnormal and accompanied by obesity, hypotonia, and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. As with the general population, management should consider the various causal factors as well as potential difficulties in treating both children and adults with RTS.

Assessment of sleep patterns using a validated questionnaire, such as the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children, may provide information on both sleep patterns and response to therapy. Prior to major surgical intervention, polysomnography should be considered. Management of sleep disorders is aimed at implementing healthy sleep practices, particularly the position during sleep, behavioral strategies, and the use of and education on pharmacological treatments.

### Incidence of skin sensitivity following Dermabond application in pediatric orthopedic surgery [^117DLqrc]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Low credibility.

Dermabond (Dermabond; Ethicon, Sommerville, NJ) is a skin adhesive commonly utilized in pediatric orthopedic surgery for postoperative wound care. Few studies have examined outcomes of Dermabond exposure in children. The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of skin reactions following Dermabond exposure in pediatric orthopedic surgery and investigate potential risk factors associated with Dermabond sensitivity.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of a level-one pediatric trauma center. All orthopedic surgeries in 2019 were screened for Dermabond application. Three surgeons with the highest rates of Dermabond application defined our cohort. Out of 2,990 surgeries in 2019, the three surgeons performed 234 surgeries with Dermabond. Postoperative reactions and repeat Dermabond exposures were collected for these 234 patients. Subjects with known allergies to Dermabond were excluded. Reactions were defined as discoloration, irritation, and wound dehiscence. Significant differences between patients with repeat Dermabond exposures and those without were determined using χ² analysis. Associations between patient characteristics and sensitivity were determined using logistic regression analysis. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

- **Results**: In all, 234 patients were included for analysis. The mean age at surgery was 12.5 years (SD 6.1), and 39% (92/234) of the cohort was male. Thirty-two patients (14%) experienced skin reactions during the study period (95% CI = 7%-19%). Reactions most frequently included erythema (10/32; 31%) and itching.

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including Quazepam tablets. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with Quazepam tablets should not be rechallenged with the drug.

- **Abnormal thinking and behavior changes**: Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, including Quazepam tablets. Some of these changes include decreased inhibition (e.g. aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have also been reported. Amnesia and other neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur. Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, and sleep disturbances may occur unpredictably. Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e. driving while not fully awake, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with use of sedative-hypnotics. These behaviors can occur with initial treatment or in patients previously tolerant of Quazepam tablets or other sedative-hypnotics. Although these behaviors can occur with use at therapeutic doses, the risk…

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11247AmX]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically in the management of exacerbations in a primary care setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a brief focused history, performing a relevant physical examination, and obtaining objective measurements concurrently with the prompt initiation of therapy in patients presenting with asthma exacerbation to primary care.

- **History**:
	- Timing of onset and cause (if known) of the present exacerbation.
	- Severity of asthma symptoms, including any limiting exercise or disturbing sleep.
	- Any symptoms of anaphylaxis.
	- Any risk factors for asthma-related death.
	- All reliever and maintenance medications, including doses and devices prescribed, adherence patterns, any recent dose changes, and response to therapy.

- **Physical examination**:
	- Signs of exacerbation severity and vital signs, including level of consciousness, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, ability to complete sentences, use of accessory muscles, and wheezing.
	- Complicating factors, such as anaphylaxis, pneumonia, or pneumothorax.
	- Signs of alternative conditions explaining acute breathlessness, such as cardiac failure, inducible laryngeal obstruction, inhaled foreign body, or pulmonary embolism.

- **Objective measurements**:
	- Pulse oximetry saturation levels.
	- Peak expiratory flow in patients over 5 years old.

### Novel perspective of 'poor sleep' in public health: A narrative review [^115PFzv8]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

The criteria that may be considered for the identification of poor sleepers in primary care are shown in figure 2B, and the possible detection tools and their characteristics are reported in figure 2C. Ideally, the tool used for the detection of poor sleepers should combine the ability to capture subjective measures, such as a patient's perception of the sleep experience, and objective parameters, such as sleep quantity. Additionally, it should be open-ended, short, and adaptable to self-assessment use.

Self-assessment methods could be helpful to encourage poor sleepers to seek medical care; however, it should be noted that the correlation between self-reported and objectively measured sleep is moderately biased, and only healthcare providers can diagnose poor sleep.

- **Self-rated questionnaires**: Five self-rated questionnaires are of interest because they focus on sleep quality and quality of life and may be helpful in assessing poor sleepers:
	- The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index assesses sleep quality and disturbances.
	- The Mini-Sleep Questionnaire investigates both sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.
	- The Jenkins Sleep Scale evaluates the most common symptoms in the general population, such as trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night with/without trouble falling back asleep, and feeling tired after sleep.
	- The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire assesses sleep onset, quality of sleep, awakening from sleep, and behavior following wakefulness.
	- The National Institutes of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System is a validated questionnaire associated with these assessments.

### Effect of midazolam co-administered with oxycodone on ventilation: A randomised clinical trial in healthy volunteers [^113zZPw1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines can exacerbate opioid-induced respiratory depression by further decreasing central respiratory drive and causing loss of upper airway patency, potentially leading to airway obstruction. This study aimed to determine if the co-administration of benzodiazepines and opioids significantly decreases hypercapnic ventilation compared with opioids alone.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, four-period crossover trial in 20 healthy participants to assess whether intravenous midazolam (0.0375 mg/kg in the first five participants; 0.075 mg/kg in 15 participants) plus oral oxycodone (10 mg), compared with oxycodone alone, decreases minute ventilation at an end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pco2) of 7.3 kPa using modified Read rebreathing methodology.

- **Results**: Midazolam administered with oxycodone, compared with oxycodone alone, did not significantly decrease minute ventilation at an end-tidal Pco2 of 7.3 kPa (23.5 vs. 25.2 L/min; mean difference -1.7 L/min, one-sided 95% confidence interval -∞ to 1.6; P = 0.21). However, midazolam plus oxycodone increased resting end-tidal Pco2 compared with oxycodone alone (5.8 vs. 5.6 kPa; mean difference 0.2 kPa, 95% confidence interval 0.0–0.4). Nine of 15 (60%) participants fell asleep or snored on midazolam plus oxycodone, compared with 0 of 15 (0%) on oxycodone alone.

- **Conclusions**: Midazolam co-administered with oxycodone did not decrease hypercapnic ventilation compared with oxycodone alone but did affect tidal volume, ventilatory frequency, and resting end-tidal Pco2. These findings support the need for careful monitoring of patients receiving this drug combination.

### Airway and airway obstruction site segmentation study using U-Net with drug-induced sleep endoscopy images [^116EVS2Q]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by a decrease or cessation of breathing due to repetitive closure of the upper airway during sleep, leading to a decrease in blood oxygen saturation. In this study, employing a U-Net model, we utilized drug-induced sleep endoscopy images to segment the major causes of airway obstruction, including the epiglottis, oropharynx lateral walls, and tongue base. The evaluation metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Dice score, with airway sensitivity at 0.93 (± 0.06), specificity at 0.96 (± 0.01), accuracy at 0.95 (± 0.01), and Dice score at 0.84 (± 0.03), indicating overall high performance. The results indicate the potential for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automatic interpretation of sleep disorder diagnosis, with implications for standardizing medical procedures and improving healthcare services. The study suggests that advancements in AI technology hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy in sleep and respiratory disorders, fostering competitiveness in the medical AI market.

### Mitigo [^111bUL2V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants**: Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Mitigo® with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g. non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Use of neuroleptics in conjunction with neuraxial morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect a similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^117Lyxm6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In an evaluation of a patient with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, a clinician should always ask questions about sleep. Instruments useful for this purpose include the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire or the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA). Sleep-related symptoms may be hallmarks of certain neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, or sleep disorders may adversely impact overall function in any individual, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Addressing sleep problems through lifestyle interventions improves general health. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, with loss of REM-associated atonia resulting in acting out of dreams, often violently, has a strong association with Lewy body dementia (LBD). Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorders are even more likely to be under-reported by informants and, almost never, by patients. REM sleep behavioral disturbances may precede by many years what ultimately evolves to become dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's-related dementia. In cognitively unimpaired persons, reduced slow-wave sleep activity and low sleep efficiency are both associated with an accelerated rate of cortical amyloid beta plaque deposition, and hence accumulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neuropathological change.

Sleep disorders have multiple relationships with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is deleterious to optimal brain function and health. It is common in MCI and can exacerbate impairments in cognition, mood/behavior, and/or function. Treatment of OSA may reverse cognitive and behavioral decline in some patients.

### Sex differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing [^112pGT7U]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Looking at the different groups of sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, and sleep-related movement disorders, there are consistent findings on sex differences for these sleep disorders in terms of prevalence, symptom presentation, and, in some cases, treatment outcomes. Increasing attention is being paid to sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) syndromes, and obesity-related hypoventilation. This difference is partly explained by differences in upper airway collapsibility, respiratory control, and comorbidities, but for the most part, it is incompletely understood and often insufficiently systematically investigated, particularly in SDB other than OSA. In addition, there are sex differences in the consequences of sleep disorders, particularly the cardiovascular and metabolic consequences. However, women are generally underrepresented in most randomized controlled intervention studies on SDB, which makes it difficult to assess potential differences in treatment outcomes. This review briefly highlights known sex differences in sleep and control of ventilation, and then discusses the evidence base and recent findings on sex differences in SDB.

### Sleep disruption and atrial fibrillation: Evidence, mechanisms and clinical implications [^116UTWZz]. Circulation Research (2025). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies have highlighted a link between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, and various arrhythmias. There is heterogeneity in the prevalence and incidence of OSA due to the different metrics used to test for it. However, the absolute and causative link between sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation (AF) is likely influenced by the patient's overall cardiovascular health, which determines the substrate for AF.

Over the past 50 years, the prevalence of AF has increased threefold. The Global Burden of Disease project estimated the worldwide prevalence of AF at around 46.3 million individuals in 2016. In the United States, between three to six million individuals have AF, with projections suggesting an increase to between six and sixteen million by 2050. Hospitalizations, repeat hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization are on the rise due to prolonged hospital stays and the associated costs.

OSA is frequently observed in patients with AF. Patients diagnosed with OSA have a two-to-four-fold higher risk of developing AF compared to those without OSA. Similarly, individuals with AF have an increased prevalence of OSA, ranging from 10% to 60%, depending on testing methods. The comparison of causation and association between OSA and AF remains unclear due to nonuniform definitions and varied screening and diagnostic tests. The prevalence of OSA, defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of 5 or greater, is reported to be between 43% to 85% among patients undergoing diagnostic testing, whether at home or in a dedicated sleep laboratory.

### Results of the solriamfetol's effect on cognitive health in apnea participants during a randomized placebo-controlled study (SHARP): A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures crossover phase IV clinical trial of the effect of the wake-promoting agent solriamfetol on cognitive function in OSA with excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment [^1146d7Yh]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

The SHARP study, published in 2025 in the journal Chest, focuses on diseases including obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. The trial aimed to determine the role of solriamfetol, an NDRI, in managing cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness. This multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 59 patients (21 female, 38 male) meeting the inclusion criteria of cognitive impairment related to obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients with usual bedtime later than 1:00 am, shift workers, individuals using medications affecting excessive daytime sleepiness, contraindications for solriamfetol, users of positive airway pressure machines without downloadable adherence data, those with sleep disorders other than obstructive sleep apnea, excessive caffeine use, and individuals with clinically relevant medical, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders associated with impaired cognitive function.

- **Interventions**:
	- **N = 30**: Solriamfetol (75 mg daily for 3 days, then 150 mg daily for 2 weeks).
	- **N = 29**: Placebo (matching placebo each morning for 2 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: A significant improvement was noted in postdose average scores on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Solriamfetol users improved by 6.49 points compared to 4.74 points in the placebo group (mean difference 1.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.04).

### Restoril [^112dGQgF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Restoril improved sleep parameters in clinical studies, with residual medication effects ("hangover") essentially absent. Early morning awakening, a particular problem in geriatric patients, was significantly reduced.

Patients with chronic insomnia were evaluated in two-week, placebo-controlled sleep laboratory studies with Restoril at doses of 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg, given 30 minutes prior to bedtime. There was a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency, with significant drug-placebo differences at two weeks occurring only for total sleep time at the two higher doses, and for sleep latency only at the highest dose.

In these sleep laboratory studies, REM sleep was essentially unchanged and slow wave sleep was decreased. No measurable effects on daytime alertness or performance occurred following Restoril treatment or during the withdrawal period, even though a transient sleep disturbance in some sleep parameters was observed following withdrawal of the higher doses. There was no evidence of tolerance development in the sleep laboratory parameters when patients were given Restoril nightly for at least two weeks.

In addition, normal subjects with transient insomnia associated with first-night adaptation to the sleep laboratory were evaluated in 24-hour, placebo-controlled sleep laboratory studies with Restoril at doses of 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg, given 30 minutes prior to bedtime. There was a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time, sleep latency, and number of awakenings.

### Fezolinetant treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: Effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in two phase 3 studies (SKYLIGHT 1 and 2) [^116Ni8mq]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

- **Extrinsic assessments**: The extrinsic factors investigated in this study, which relate to the external parameters influencing the individual, included lifestyle factors and geographical location. These encompassed smoking status (and former/never), alcohol history (and former/never), caffeine use at baseline (0 cups of caffeinated beverage intake per day and > 0 cups of caffeinated beverage intake per day), and region (Europe and North America). Additionally, extrinsic medical history factors were evaluated, such as sleep disturbance (< 1st quartile, ≥ 1st quartile to < median, ≥ median to < 3rd quartile, and ≥ 3rd quartile), medical history of hypertension (yes and no), oophorectomy history (yes and no), hysterectomy history (yes and no), and hysterectomy/oophorectomy history (hysterectomy without oophorectomy and hysterectomy with oophorectomy). The study also examined the use of medication, specifically previous HT treatment (yes and no), reasons for stopping HT (lack of symptomatic improvement and other), and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; yes and no).

- **Safety assessments**: The overall safety of fezolinetant and placebo was investigated using the TEAE data obtained for the entire pooled population over the initial 12-week treatment period.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^113W9sZx]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for male hypogonadism, specifically in relation to testosterone therapy and choice of preparation, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering testosterone gels rather than long-acting depot administration when starting initial treatment. This approach allows for adjustment or discontinuation of therapy in the event of treatment-related adverse effects.

### Belsomra [^112fPUQR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Patients with compromised respiratory function**: The effect of BELSOMRA on respiratory function should be considered if prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function. BELSOMRA has not been studied in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses**: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder and can emerge during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs such as BELSOMRA.

### Quviviq [^111ZLjss]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses**: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a medical and/or psychiatric disorder, treatment of insomnia should be initiated only following a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or medical disorder and can emerge during the course of treatment with sleep-promoting drugs such as Quviviq.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^115hZBWp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Concomitant use of central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. The use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants is particularly concerning. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

- **Debilitation and comorbid considerations**: Higher risk adult and pediatric surgical patients, elderly patients, and debilitated adult and pediatric patients require lower dosages, whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered. Adult or pediatric patients with COPD are unusually sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of midazolam hydrochloride. Pediatric and adult patients undergoing procedures involving the upper airway, such as upper endoscopy or dental care, are particularly vulnerable to episodes of desaturation and hypoventilation due to partial airway obstruction. Adult and pediatric patients with chronic renal failure and patients with congestive heart failure eliminate midazolam more slowly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Because elderly patients frequently have inefficient function of one or more organ systems and because dosage requirements have been shown to decrease with age, a reduced initial dosage of midazolam hydrochloride is recommended. The possibility of profound and/or prolonged effect should be considered.

Injectable midazolam should not be administered to adult or pediatric patients in shock or coma, or in acute alcohol intoxication with respiratory depression.

### Treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder with trazodone: report of 3 cases [^113wWiqK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a sleep disturbance characterized by the absence of regular paralysis during rapid eye movement sleep, accompanied by dream enactment behavior. The available pharmacotherapy options for treating rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are limited, and the utilization of antidepressants has yielded mixed results. We report three cases of isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder improved with trazodone. Doses of 50–100mg of trazodone at bedtime over 4–6 months resulted in significant clinical improvement. These cases highlight that trazodone could serve as a treatment for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder that does not respond to traditional treatments at submaximal dosages.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^111xj47E]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

The British Thoracic Society Guidelines recommend that a score of at least 0.33 on the Sleep-Related Breathing Disordered Scale of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire can be used to diagnose moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep disordered breathing (oSDB) in children aged at least 2 years with no comorbidities, if consistent with clinical features. They note, however, that the questionnaire has low specificity; therefore, if the results do not match the clinical picture, additional tests such as pulse oximetry, cardiorespiratory polygraphy, or full overnight polysomnography (PSG) are recommended to aid in the decision.

Pulse oximetry is suggested as a first-line diagnostic test for children older than 2 years suspected of having oSDB. The analysis focuses on mean saturation (< 95%), the number of desaturations below 90%, the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) — the number of decreases in oxygen saturation (SatO₂) of 3% or 4% per hour, with an ODI 3 greater than 7 or an ODI 4 greater than 4 per hour being considered abnormal — and the presence of clusters of desaturations.

In addition, they state that clinicians can use video and audio recordings in a similar way to clinical observation to support intervention to treat oSDB. If pulse oximetry results do not fit the clinical picture, a higher level of investigation, such as a cardiorespiratory sleep study or full overnight PSG, may be required depending on test availability. These tests allow for computing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Importantly, however, they emphasize that clinicians are cautioned about using AHI alone to guide decision-making.

In summary, the new recommendations from the French consensus of experts and the British Thoracic Society provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing oSDB in children.

### Eszopiclone [^115eydHu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Need to evaluate for comorbid diagnoses**: Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only following a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including eszopiclone. Because some of the important adverse effects of eszopiclone appear to be dose related, it is important to use the lowest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions**: Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including eszopiclone. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with eszopiclone should not be rechallenged with the drug.

### Cobenfy [^115KYHva]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk of use in patients with biliary disease**: Inform patients that Cobenfy can increase liver enzymes and about the need for specific monitoring, including liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Inform patients to report symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, or upper abdominal pain to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Decreased gastrointestinal motility**: Inform patients that Cobenfy can delay or slow the emptying of food in their stomach. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider about the presence of or symptoms of gastrointestinal obstructive disorders and conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Risk of angioedema**: Advise patients that hypersensitivity reactions to Cobenfy could occur and may result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. If these symptoms occur, discontinue Cobenfy and seek immediate medical attention.

- **Risk of use in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma**: Inform patients that pupillary dilation may occur with Cobenfy use and, in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
