## Question

What are the specific situations in which chest X-rays are recommended for latent tuberculosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when chest X-rays are recommended for latent tuberculosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that active TB must be excluded before treating LTBI. Then, I should verify the universal recommendation to obtain a chest radiograph after a positive TST or IGRA. Next, I will examine special high-risk populations where CXR is emphasized, including children under 5, people with HIV, and those starting immunosuppression. After that, I should consider contact investigations and occupational health scenarios. Finally, I will review exceptions, alternatives like CT, and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: active TB must be excluded before initiating LTBI therapy because TST/IGRA cannot distinguish latent from active disease, and treating active TB with a single drug risks resistance and undertreatment. This is why guidelines uniformly recommend a chest radiograph as part of the evaluation after a positive immunologic test or when symptoms are present [^11183sTw].

> I should confirm the universal recommendation. After any positive TST or IGRA, obtain a chest radiograph to exclude active pulmonary TB; if the chest radiograph is abnormal, proceed with sputum studies and clinical assessment before starting LTBI treatment, whereas a normal chest radiograph in an asymptomatic person supports LTBI and allows preventive therapy to proceed once other exclusions are met [^11183sTw] [^1126tdg9] [^11592vQU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check special high-risk populations where CXR is particularly emphasized. In children under 5 years, especially household contacts, guidelines recommend a medical evaluation including a chest radiograph and TST, with treatment for presumed LTBI if the TST is positive or if the child is high risk even with a negative initial test, because progression risk is high and radiography helps detect early disease or atypical patterns in this age group [^116X81fH] [^112eFzcz].

> Next, I should review people with HIV. Wait, let me verify the nuance here. While some guidelines frame CXR broadly for PLHIV, WHO's 2024 update specifically recommends considering CXR to screen for TB in adult and adolescent patients living with HIV, reflecting the higher burden and atypical radiographic presentations; thus, CXR is appropriate both for screening and for evaluating positive immunologic tests in this group [^111XQpoq] [^11183sTw].

> I will now examine immunosuppression and biologic therapy. Before initiating anti-TNF therapy, organ transplantation, dialysis, or other high-risk immunosuppression, guidelines recommend systematic LTBI testing with CXR to exclude active TB, given the markedly increased risk of reactivation; this is a strong indication for routine CXR even in the absence of symptoms [^113qfKJb] [^11183sTw] [^114CHPsC].

> Let me consider contact investigations. Close contacts of infectious TB cases should undergo evaluation that includes symptom screening and chest radiography to detect early disease; in children under 5, this is accompanied by TST and treatment for presumed LTBI if indicated, aligning with the high risk of progression in recent exposures [^116X81fH] [^11183sTw].

> I should double-check occupational health scenarios. Healthcare personnel with a positive TST or IGRA should have a baseline chest radiograph to exclude active TB; repeat CXR is not routinely required unless symptoms develop or treatment for LTBI is being initiated, in which case a repeat CXR may be needed to document baseline status or reassess risk [^112vqaMK].

> But wait, what if the chest radiograph is nonrevealing and suspicion remains high? The ACR Appropriateness Criteria suggest chest CT when CXR is nonrevealing or nondiagnostic, particularly when active disease is suspected or the patient is high risk; this is not for routine LTBI evaluation but for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty after CXR [^115atxPC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CXR might be universally required for all LTBI evaluations regardless of symptoms, but I should correct that. In truly asymptomatic, immunocompetent adults with a positive TST/IGRA and no known high-risk features, a normal CXR generally suffices to exclude active TB and permit LTBI therapy; however, in high-risk groups or when symptoms are present, CXR is mandatory, and further diagnostic steps are warranted if abnormalities are found [^11183sTw] [^1126tdg9].

> Let me synthesize the specific situations succinctly. Chest radiography is recommended for latent TB in the following scenarios: after any positive TST or IGRA to exclude active disease; in children under 5 years, especially household contacts; in people with HIV; before initiating immunosuppressive therapy including anti-TNF agents, transplantation, or dialysis; in close contacts of infectious TB cases; and in occupational health evaluations after a new positive test in healthcare workers. In low-risk, asymptomatic adults with a positive immunologic test, a normal CXR is usually sufficient, whereas abnormal CXR findings require sputum evaluation before LTBI treatment [^11183sTw] [^116X81fH] [^111XQpoq] [^113qfKJb] [^112vqaMK] [^1126tdg9].

Chest X-ray is **not routinely required** for latent TB infection (LTBI) [^11183sTw] but is indicated to exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy in the following situations: a positive TST or IGRA [^1126tdg9]; symptoms or signs suggestive of active TB [^114w9XTg]; immunocompromise (HIV, transplant, biologics, corticosteroids ≥ 15 mg/day) [^112MvpnN]; close contact with infectious TB [^116X81fH]; or prior TB or abnormal CXR [^115rs5ZG]. CXR is **not needed** if the patient is asymptomatic, immunocompetent, and has no prior TB history or abnormal CXR. If CXR is abnormal, obtain sputum smear/culture or NAAT before LTBI treatment [^1126tdg9].

---

## Indications for chest X-ray in LTBI

Chest X-ray is **indicated in LTBI** to exclude active TB before initiating preventive therapy. The following scenarios require CXR:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for chest x-ray** |
|-|-|
| Positive TST or IGRA result | Required to exclude active TB before LTBI treatment [^11183sTw] [^1126tdg9] |
| Symptoms or signs suggestive of active TB (e.g. cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss) | Required to exclude active TB [^114w9XTg] [^1126tdg9] |
| Immunocompromised patients (HIV, transplant recipients, patients on biologics, corticosteroids ≥ 15 mg/day) | Required to exclude active TB [^1158Chf7] [^113qfKJb] |
| Close contacts of infectious TB cases | Required to exclude active TB [^116X81fH] [^11183sTw] |
| History of prior TB or abnormal CXR | Required to exclude active TB [^115rs5ZG] [^11183sTw] |

---

## Situations where chest X-ray is not required

CXR is **not routinely required** in asymptomatic, immunocompetent patients with no prior TB or abnormal CXR, as the likelihood of active disease is low and the yield is minimal [^11183sTw].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ATS/IDSA/CDC guidelines**: CXR is recommended to exclude active TB before LTBI treatment in patients with positive TST/IGRA, symptoms, immunocompromise, close contact, or prior TB/abnormal CXR [^11183sTw] [^1126tdg9].
- **WHO guidelines**: CXR is recommended to exclude active TB in high-risk populations (e.g. HIV, transplant, biologics, close contacts) before preventive therapy [^113qfKJb] [^117UmRkf].
- **CDC**: CXR is not required for asymptomatic, immunocompetent patients with no prior TB or abnormal CXR [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal chest X-ray findings

Abnormal CXR findings (e.g. infiltrates, cavities, nodules) **require further evaluation** to exclude active TB:

- **Sputum smear/culture**: Obtain sputum samples for smear, culture, or NAAT (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) [^115rs5ZG] [^113FGpTX].
- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate symptoms, signs, and risk factors for active TB [^1126tdg9].
- **Delay LTBI treatment**: Do not start LTBI therapy until active TB is excluded [^115rs5ZG].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False negatives**: CXR can miss early or extrapulmonary TB, especially in immunocompromised patients [^112dWfRE].
- **False positives**: CXR abnormalities can be due to other conditions (e.g. pneumonia, malignancy), requiring clinical correlation [^112dWfRE].
- **Resource limitations**: CXR may not be available in resource-limited settings, necessitating alternative strategies [^113TLiZw].

---

Chest X-ray is **indicated in LTBI** to exclude active TB before therapy in patients with positive TST/IGRA, symptoms, immunocompromise, close contact, or prior TB/abnormal CXR. It is not required for asymptomatic, immunocompetent patients without prior TB or abnormal CXR. Abnormal CXR findings require further evaluation before LTBI treatment.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing — IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

Background

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

Methods

A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

Conclusions

These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality for thousands of years. Despite the availability of a vaccine for over 100 years and drugs for over 75 years, TB remains the leading cause of death globally from an infectious disease. TB has a complex natural history and pathogenesis which is still incompletely understood. A minority of people exposed and considered infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) progress to disease. The incubation period is variable, with highly heterogeneous disease presentation and progression pathways. Faced with this complexity, a simplifying framework has value in helping to guide and communicate the public health approach, management, and scientific investigation of TB. Periodically, the nature of the framework inevitably must evolve reflecting new scientific understanding, tools for diagnosis and intervention, and public health priorities.

The development of curative antibiotic treatment from the late 1940s resulted in a radical change in the approach to managing TB and led to a shift in approach to disease classification. Prior to this period, TB was recognised as a dynamic process, with prognostic stratification by disease extent on chest X-ray (CXR) and the precise classification of current disease state (arrested, quiescent, active, etc.). This approach was abandoned and in its place, a simple binary paradigm of latent infection and active disease emerged. The diagnosis of disease increasingly focused on microbiological confirmation as a prerequisite for receiving curative treatment. Infection was inferred from evidence of immune sensitisation to Mtb antigens in the absence of features of disease, with therapy recommended in certain situations to prevent progression to disease. This binomial simplicity facilitated the development and improvement of programmatic management of TB during the 1990s particularly with the DOTS strategy, which emphasised case detection and standardised treatment of symptomatic people with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB. While this approach prevented millions of TB deaths, it had lesser impact on transmission and disease incidence, possibly because millions of individuals with TB do not present to health facilities or receive care.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) management — benefits and risk — notes there are 2 major benefits of treating LTBI, preventing progression to active TB disease and producing public health benefits; patients with LTBI have a 4%–6% lifetime risk of developing TB disease, with approximately half of cases following recent exposure; in a trial of 28 000 individuals with LTBI and radiographic evidence of healed tuberculosis, isoniazid for 52 weeks reduced subsequent TB disease from 14.3% to 3.6%; overall, studies provide high-quality evidence of benefit in high-risk populations and only moderate-quality evidence for low or intermediate risk populations.

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^1118WXxe]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this study offer several important insights about mass screening and tuberculosis risk. First, after active screening, partnered interventions may be guided by the different types of abnormal imaging results for high-risk populations. For individuals exhibiting signs of active tuberculosis, uncertain signs, or those with cavities, strengthening pathogen detection based on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sampling, fully utilizing the sensitivity and timeliness advantages of molecular diagnostic technologies to achieve early diagnosis and prompt treatment. For clinical diagnoses without supporting pathogen evidence, standardized evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis treatment should be conducted to support clinical diagnosis and improve treatment completion rates. These recommendations need further validation in different regions and populations across China. Second, preventive interventions — such as preventive treatment or a full disease treatment regimen — among persons without microbiologically-positive tuberculosis but suggestive X-rays should be further explored. In China and most other settings, this population is not prioritized likely due a lack of empirical evidence regarding effective interventional approaches.

Diagnostic approach for suspected LTBI — principles — states that no definitive diagnostic test for LTBI exists; recommendations for diagnostic testing are based upon the likelihood of infection with Mtb and the likelihood of progression to TB disease if infected; and, given the lack of randomized or observational studies directly comparing diagnostic approaches with clinical outcomes, recommendations are based on evidence about test accuracy combined with evidence that treatment of LTBI improves clinical outcomes.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^115rs5ZG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Drug-susceptible tuberculosis — diagnostic evaluation and initial management: CDC recommends the use of a rapid molecular test on at least one specimen from each patient with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, and in a compatible clinical syndrome a positive AFB smear provides strong inferential evidence for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, after which the regimen is continued to complete a standard course of therapy when confirmed by isolation of M. tuberculosis, a positive rapid molecular test, or clinical/radiographic response. In smear-positive but rapid molecular test–negative cases, polymerase chain reaction inhibitors are reported in 2%–5% of M. tuberculosis; if empiric therapy is given yet cultures remain negative without clinical response and IGRA or PPD–TST is positive, latent tuberculosis infection options are: stop treatment if RIF and PZA were included in initial 4-drug therapy administered for at least 2 months; continue RIF with or without INH for a total of 4 months; give 12 weekly doses of INH/RPT by DOT; or continue INH for a total of 9 months. In patients with low suspicion for active tuberculosis who were not initially treated, if cultures remain negative, the IGRA or PPD–TST is positive (≥ 5 mm), and the abnormal chest radiograph is unchanged after 2 months, treatment for latent tuberculosis infection is indicated, and if not previously treated these patients have case rates 2.5–19 times higher than those with normal chest radiographs. When suspicion is low, treatment may begin with combination chemotherapy or be deferred until additional data clarify the situation (usually within 2 months), and an advantage of early combination chemotherapy is that the patient will have completed 2 months of combination treatment that can be applied to the total duration of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection; however, treatment for latent tuberculosis infection with a single drug is not initiated until active tuberculosis has been excluded, usually by negative cultures. For complicated diagnostic or management situations, consultation with local and state health departments is advised.

### CT in the detection of latent tuberculosis: a systematic review [^117ECWup]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the use of computed tomography (CT) and low-dose CT in the detection of latent tuberculosis (TB).

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of literature in adherence with the PRISMA guidelines was carried out. Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted.

Results

The search strategy identified a total of 4,621 studies. Sixteen studies were considered eligible and included in the review. There was high heterogeneity among all studies. CT was identified as much more sensitive for the detection of latent TB in all studies despite chest radiography often being recommended in guidelines to assess patients for latent TB. Low-dose CT showed promising results in four of the studies; however, these results were limited due to small sample sizes.

Conclusion

CT is much superior to chest radiography consistently identifying additional cases of latent TB. There are limited high-quality publications available using low-dose CT but findings thus far suggest low-dose CT could be used as an alternative to standard-dose CT for the detection of latent TB. It is recommended that a randomised controlled trial investigating low-dose CT should be carried out.

### Clinical overview of latent tuberculosis infection… [^112MvpnN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

People with latent TB infection:

- Have a small number of TB bacteria in their body that are alive but inactive Cannotspread TB bacteria to others
- Do notfeel sick, but may become sick if the bacteria in their bodies become active
- Usually have a positiveTB blood test or TB skin test results indicating TB infection
- Have typically normalchest radiographs
- Have negativesputum smears and cultures
- Should consider treatment for latent TB infection to prevent TB disease
- Do notrequire respiratory isolation.
- Lymph nodes,
- Lungs,
- Kidneys,
- Brain, and
- Bone. Within 2 to 8 weeks, special immune cells called macrophages ingest and surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a barrier shell called a granuloma that keeps the bacilli contained and under control. This condition is known as latent TB infection.
- People with HIV
- Children younger than 5 years of age
- People recently infected with TB bacteria
- People with a history of untreated or inadequately treated TB disease
- People who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, systemic corticosteroids equivalent to/greater than 15 mg of prednisone per day, or immunosuppressive drug therapy following organ transplantation.
- QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus
- T-SPOT®. TB test. Health care providers are encouraged to use newer TB blood tests to detect latent TB infection. TB skin tests are an acceptable alternative in situations where a TB blood test is not available, is too costly, or is too burdensome. The bacille Calmette-Guérin TB vaccine can cause a false positive TB skin test result. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by BCG vaccination. Routine testing with both TB blood and skin tests is not recommended.

Consider these factors when determining which test to use. A diagnosis of latent TB infection is made if a person has a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result and a medical exam does not indicate TB disease. The diagnosis is based on information gathered from:

- Medical history,
- TB blood test or TB skin test,
- Chest radiograph,
- Physical examination, and
- Sputum examination.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — two-step strategy considerations are described: Performing a second diagnostic test when the initial test is negative is a strategy to increase sensitivity. This may reduce specificity, but the panel decided that this is an acceptable trade-off in situations in which the consequences of missing LTBI (ie, not treating individuals who may benefit from therapy) exceed the consequences of inappropriate therapy (ie, hepatotoxicity). Performing a confirmatory test following an initial positive result is based upon both the evidence that false-positive results are common among individuals who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the committee's presumption that performing a second test on those patients whose initial test was positive will help identify initial false-positive results.

Discussion

TB is an infectious disease that occurs in all ages, with high incidence and prevalence worldwide. It can directly affect children under the age of five, contacts of patients with pulmonary TB, causing the risk of becoming infected and developing the disease throughout life. For this reason, this age group requires special attention and vigilance for an early diagnosis to provide timely preventive treatment and prevents the progression to disease immediately or in subsequent years. In developing countries like Colombia, access barriers to health care services are high, and basic diagnostic tools such as chest radiography are needed to make an accurate diagnosis. It has a direct impact on the diagnostic process of this disease, by contributing to the classification of latent or active TB after the infection has been confirmed.

The population group studied was characterized by being mostly from Medellín, having a predominance of males, an average age of 31 months, belonging to low socioeconomic strata and a significant percentage living in crowded and displaced conditions. The majority were infected at the beginning with positive TST (cut-off point 5 mm). Furthermore, the global interpretation of the initial chest X-ray concluded that the majority were normal but evidenced suspicion of active TB in a significant percentage (6.7%), demonstrating the direct link of the disease with difficult economic situations. Guarda and Kreft claim that to achieve the diagnosis in children, a chest X-ray is required, which is a fundamental tool for the diagnostic support of these patients. What's more, they clarify that a normal chest X-ray does not rule out the presence of lung disease; therefore, the reading of the radiograph must be carried out in a very detailed way, thus considering any finding as suspicious of the disease.

### Identification and management of latent tuberculosis infection [^113tS7CL]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a condition in which a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but does not currently have active tuberculosis disease. An estimated 10 to 15 million persons in the United States have LTBI. Because 5 to 10 percent of persons with LTBI are at risk of progressing to active disease, identification and treatment of LTBI are essential for the elimination of tuberculosis. Screening is recommended for high-risk persons, including immigrants; residents and employees of congregate living facilities; and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Targeted tuberculin skin testing remains the most acceptable method of LTBI screening. New tests are being developed, the most promising of which are in vitro interferon-gamma release assays. All screened persons found to have LTBI should be offered treatment, regardless of age. Before initiating treatment, active tuberculosis must be ruled out by patient history, physical examination, and chest radiography. The treatment of choice for LTBI is isoniazid for nine months. Hepatotoxicity is the most severe adverse effect. Isoniazid should be discontinued if transaminase levels are greater than three times the upper limit of normal in symptomatic patients or five times the upper limit of normal in asymptomatic patients.

Conclusion

For patients without drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions, short-course (3–4 months) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course (6–9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

### Tuberculosis: common questions and answers [^11592vQU]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year, there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease and up to 13 million people were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in health care professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed and, in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum collected for diagnosis. Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local or state health departments. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert is necessary if there is suspicion or confirmation of drug-resistant TB.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spectrum and latent tuberculosis infection definitions: Persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have a broad array of presentations, ranging from those with clinical, radiographic, and microbiological evidence of tuberculosis (TB disease) to those who are infected with Mtb but have no clinical evidence of TB disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Individuals with LTBI who have been recently exposed have an increased risk of developing TB, whereas those with remote exposure have less risk over time unless they develop a condition that impairs immunity. Operationally, recent exposure can be defined either epidemiologically (ie, as might occur in the setting of the household of an infectious case or occupational exposure) or immunologically (ie, conversion of a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] from negative to positive).

### Reproducibility of a protocol for standardized reading of chest X-rays of children household contact of patients with tuberculosis [^115SDB4p]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which is present throughout the world. It is the ninth leading cause of death, with a predominance in developing countries; where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high and resources are insufficient for disease identification and treatment.

Approximately 10 million people became ill with TB in 2019, 12% were children under the age of 15. Geographically, the majority were in regions of Southeast Asia (44%), East Africa (8.2%), America (2.9%) and Europe (2.5%); furthermore, only 54 countries had a low incidence of TB (less than 10 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year). Of the 1.3 million household contacts with TB who should access preventive treatment in 2019, only 538,396 (33%) received it, and 81% of them were children under the age of 5.

The strategy to reduce the incidence of active TB in childhood is only efficient when adequate and timely treatment is given for latent TB. Additionally, the diagnosis of TB in pediatrics is difficult, since the symptoms and radiographic changes are less specific at this age. The grouping of factors such as: paucibacillary characteristic of the infection, the laborious collection of respiratory samples, the variable symptoms and the severity of the disease exacerbated by other childhood infections such as pneumonia, malnutrition and HIV; limit the diagnostic approach, resulting in unreliable statistics due to insufficient recognition of the disease.

The notion of TB diagnosis in children under the age of 5 household contacts with TB patients, is based on the risk of developing active TB, for having contact with the infection at home, for which is necessary to intervene on time to prevent progression to disease. Laboratory tests showing infection are required initially, in addition to a chest X-ray. Having a positive immunological test in the absence of clinical manifestations and a normal chest X-ray, guides the diagnosis of latent TB; which requires treatment to prevent the disease.

Latent Mtb infection (LTBI) — natural history and risk of progression indicates that, in the absence of treatment, approximately 4%–6% of individuals who acquire LTBI will develop active tuberculosis during their lifetime, with the greatest risk of progression during the first 2 years following exposure; risk is increased among young (< 4 years) children and those receiving corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, and persons with latent infection who acquire HIV infection will develop TB disease at an approximate rate of 5%–10% per year when not receiving effective HIV treatment.

### The health impact of identifying a person with tuberculosis through systematic screening [^111AX8To]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Screening populations at high risk for tuberculosis might improve clinical outcomes and reduce transmission, but the value and cost-effectiveness of population-based screening depend on the uncertain health impact of early tuberculosis detection. In this Personal View, we propose a framework for estimating the incremental health impact of systematic screening, including effects on tuberculosis morbidity, mortality, sequelae, and transmission. Our framework accounts for the timing of screening, relative to when routine diagnosis might occur and when health effects become inevitable. We also account for the heterogeneous duration of tuberculosis, as people with longer disease courses (associated with lower mortality but more transmission) are more likely to be detected by screening. Finally, we use this framework to estimate that population-based chest x-ray screening interventions might avert 2.4 disability-adjusted life-years per person (95% uncertainty interval 0.8–7.4) found to have tuberculosis through screening-well within the cost-effectiveness thresholds for many programmes with published costs.

Benefits and harms of interpreting minimal CT/PET abnormalities as active/latent disease in asymptomatic close contacts

CT — computed tomography; PET — positron emission tomography; TB — tuberculosis; LTBI — latent tuberculosis infection

† A recent LTBI guideline recommends 3- to 4-month rifamycin or rifampin-based regimens instead of 6- to 9-month isoniazid monotherapy

‡ The risk may vary depending on the follow-up interval and preventive measures such as mask-wearing

‡† The use of isoniazid and rifampicin in LTBI treatment did not significantly increase the chance of acquired resistance to the corresponding drugs in meta-analyses

‡‡ X-ray examinations or computed tomographic imaging can be used to assess radiologic changes

Potential role of CT and PET imaging in TB contact investigations as continuum disease

A potential advantage of CT and 18 F-FDG PET imaging in TB contact investigations is that these modalities may enable earlier detection of active TB (i.e. before it becomes full-blown) in patients with normal radiographs requiring anti-TB medication and further stratification of contacts with recent LTBI who are at the higher risk for developing active TB (minimal abnormalities) from those who are less likely to develop (no abnormalities) (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Potential role of chest CT scans in TB contact investigation

The recommended US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment regimens for drug-sensitive LTBIs include 3-month once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4-month daily rifampin, and 3-month isoniazid plus rifampin with alternative options of daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months. All three regimens showed odd ratios of 0.25–0.36 against developing active TB compared to no treatment. Multidrug-resistant LTBI treatment also provides a relative risk reduction against developing active TB by 90%, although the LTBI treatment regimen has not been standardized.

### Tuberculosis: a focused review for the emergency medicine clinician [^1149E8Fc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a common disease worldwide, affecting nearly one-third of the world's population. While TB has decreased in frequency in the United States, it remains an important infection to diagnose and treat.

Objective

This narrative review discusses the evaluation and management of tuberculosis, with an emphasis on those factors most relevant for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is highly communicable through aerosolized particles. A minority of patients will develop symptomatic, primary disease. Most patients will overcome the initial infection or develop a latent infection, which can reactivate. Immunocompromised states increase the risk of primary and reactivation TB. Symptoms include fever, prolonged cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis. Initial diagnosis often includes a chest X-ray, followed by serial sputum cultures. If the patient has a normal immune system and a normal X-ray, active TB can be excluded. Newer tests, including nucleic acid amplification testing, can rapidly diagnose active TB with high sensitivity. Treatment for primary and reactivation TB differs from latent TB. Extrapulmonary forms can occur in a significant proportion of patients and involve a range of different organ systems. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus are high-risk and require specific considerations.

Conclusions

TB is a disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The emergency clinician must consider TB in the appropriate setting, based on history and examination. Accurate diagnosis and rapid therapy can improve patient outcomes and reduce the spread of this communicable disease.

The statement replaces and is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on LTBI screening, which recommended screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

While concerns about the applicability of findings to the review questions are generally low, the applicability of the review results in helping screening programmes choose a screening method requires additional considerations. Empirical studies suggest that various screening tests can reduce prevalence in settings with a high tuberculosis burden when applied at regular intervals (Corbett 2010a; Marks 2019). For further guidance on the choice of screening methods we refer to the WHO guidelines (WHO 2021a).

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^111NwvCK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis is amongst the leading infectious disease killers globally. In 2022, there was an estimated 10.6 million new tuberculosis patients worldwide. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to substantial reduction in tuberculosis case detection in 2020 and 2021. These impacts have led to calls for additional supplementary interventions, such as mass active case finding among high-risk populations, to improve case detection in settings with a high burden of tuberculosis.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in mass tuberculosis screening as both an intervention to increase case detection and prevent subsequent Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission –. The World Health Organization recommends systematic screening among certain at-risk populations including people with human immunodeficiency virus and exposed persons. A systematic tuberculosis screening strategy using chest X-ray as an initial screening test, followed by diagnostic assessment for those with abnormal findings, aims to detect tuberculosis early and initiate prompt treatment. Recent surveys in Vietnam found a reduction in community tuberculosis prevalence after multiple rounds of systematic screening. There remain several unanswered questions about the utility of mass tuberculosis screening.

In China, a large proportion of identified tuberculosis, up to 40% in some areas, are among the elderly. Whether targeting this group for mass tuberculosis screening has public health impact has not been investigated. Additionally, whether mass tuberculosis screenings should include follow-up for persons at especially high-risk of tuberculosis progression has not been thoroughly explored. The historical literature suggests that persons with abnormal chest X-rays may have as much as 10% risk of incident tuberculosis, suggesting prioritizing them for preventive interventions may be useful. In the past 50 years, few large-scale, population-level mass screening interventions have been implemented and reported to assess populations at high-risk to develop tuberculosis after mass screening interventions.

To further investigate these questions, we conducted a large mass tuberculosis screening among elderly residents aged 65 and older in a rural, high-incidence area of eastern China. Participants were stratified based on distinct chest X-ray features and a cohort was established for follow-up to identify subsequent active tuberculosis patients. Our primary aim of this study was to assess whether there was an increased tuberculosis risk among those with distinct chest X-ray abnormalities, and to evaluate factors that might influence the development of tuberculosis across distinct chest X-ray classifications during the screening period and over the subsequent two years of follow-up. This study provides data to support policymaking for tuberculosis screening and control measures in high-risk populations.

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^111UFfAZ]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and recommendations

Our findings are strikingly similar to those of the 1940s study in Europe; that mass radiography can be used to tackle 'fundamental problems of disease in the chest, both of the respiratory system and also of the heart' and 'aid in detection of early and treatable non-TB disease'. Currently, TB screening activities using CXR and CAD software are focused on finding abnormalities consistent with TB. As countries embark on TB ACF activities, they need to be aware that other respiratory and non-respiratory pathologies are likely to be as, or more prevalent, than active TB. Mass screening with CXR therefore offers opportunity to plan for and address multiple important diseases. Even though the algorithms or protocols, for example, in TB prevalence surveys do recommend that any other abnormalities should be referred as appropriate, there is no structured system for the detection and referral of such patients. Clear referral pathways, diagnostics and follow-up plans for non-TB pathology could be incorporated during the planning of TB prevalence surveys and ACF activities. Prospective data collection about non-TB conditions identified during TB screening, characterisation of these patients, exploration of individual and health systems implications of these diseases could assist with further planning. Our findings were consistent with complications of potential underlying NCDs, including chronic respiratory disease in the population. At primary care health facilities, prevention efforts for NCDs could be strengthened including health messaging.

### Interferon γ-release assays for detecting latent tuberculosis infection in patients scheduled for anti-TNF α therapy [^111CAopg]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Screening for, and treatment of, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) before anti- tumour necrosis factor α therapy has been shown to decrease the incidence of active tuberculosis by more than 80% and is recommended before initiation of treatment. In the absence of a 'gold standard' test for LTBI, current screening involves taking a clinical history of risk factors, chest radiograph and tuberculin skin test. Alternative cellular immune-based screening tests have been developed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This paper summarises the current position and advances in the use of newer screening strategies for LTBI.

### The role of chest X-ray in detecting latent tuberculosis among patients with low-risk inflammatory bowel disease before advanced therapy [^116VwET6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients treated with biologics or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have an increased risk of reactivating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). ECCO guidance recommends screening for LTBI by using clinical data, epidemiological factors, chest X-ray (CXR), and either a tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The evidence supporting CXR use is categorised at level 5. We aimed to determine the relation between CXR and IGRA test results in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) before starting immunosuppressive therapy in a low-risk population.

Methods

This retrospective analysis identified adult patients with IBD on biologics or JAK inhibitors and their epidemiological data, CXR, and IGRA results were evaluated.

Results

356 patients diagnosed with IBD were included, 58.7% (n = 209) being male. Most patients had Crohn's disease (66.6%, n = 237), 30.6% (n = 109) had ulcerative colitis, and the remaining 2.8% were classified as IBD-unclassified. The mean age of IBD diagnosis was 30.3 years (SD ± 15.7). None of the patients had any clinical suggestion or exposure to tuberculosis (TB); 93.8% (n = 334) of the IGRA results were negative and 4.2% (n = 15) were indeterminate. Among those with indeterminate results, 66.7% (n = 10) were undergoing corticosteroid treatment. The remaining 2.0% (n = 7) had a positive IGRA test result. None of the CXRs performed revealed any radiological signs of TB disease. None of these patients had TB reactivation after immunosuppresion.

Conclusion

Routinely performing a CXR in individuals with a negative IGRA offers limited benefits, and submits patients to unnecessary radiation.

Recommendation grading and interpretation — Recommendations were rated using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and the strength of a recommendation indicates the committee's certainty that the desirable consequences of the recommended course of action outweigh the undesirable consequences. A strong recommendation is one for which the subcommittee is certain, whereas a conditional recommendation is one for which the subcommittee is uncertain, and uncertainty may exist if the quality of evidence is poor, there is a fine balance between desirable and undesirable consequences, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences depends upon the clinical context, or there is variation about how individuals value the outcomes. A strong recommendation should be interpreted as the right thing to do for the vast majority of patients; a weak recommendation should be interpreted as being the right thing to do for the majority of patients, but maybe not for a sizeable minority of patients.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117V6iDj]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Definitions of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), latent tuberculosis infection or LTBI is an infection with M tuberculosis in which the bacteria are alive but contained by the immune system, persons with LTBI have no apparent symptoms, do not feel sick, cannot spread tuberculosis to others, and usually have a positive tuberculin skin test result or positive tuberculosis blood test reaction, and persons with LTBI may develop tuberculosis disease if they do not receive treatment for LTBI. Active tuberculosis or tuberculosis disease is an illness in which tuberculosis bacteria are multiplying and attacking a part of the body, usually the lungs; tuberculosis disease may be symptomatic (including weakness, weight loss, fever, no appetite, chills, sweating at night, bad cough, pain in the chest, or coughing up blood), and a person with tuberculosis disease may be infectious and spread tuberculosis bacteria to others.

Comparison with earlier version of review

The prevalence surveys already provide us with a considerable amount of data to estimate specificity, and more data will not further increase the certainty of evidence. The uncertainty in the estimates for sensitivity will not be resolved, as the additional studies are small in sample size and tuberculosis cases.

Another important reason for our serious doubt about performing an update is that the tuberculosis field is urgently waiting for the results of this review to be published. Waiting until the update is ready would not be of benefit to the field. The data from the review, as they are now, are included in the WHO 2021a update of the tuberculosis screening guidelines. We think that a more logical moment for an update would be the next update of the guideline (in five to six years). In that way the data from the Cochrane Review and the WHO guideline are the same.

### CT andF-FDG PET abnormalities in contacts with recent tuberculosis infections but negative chest X-ray [^116oRPsC]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of minimal CT or PET abnormalities in current contact investigations

TB is a continuum encompassing LTBI, incipient, subclinical TB, and active TB (Fig. 4), and subclinical TB can have X-ray abnormalities or microbiological evidence of active, viable M. tuberculosis without symptoms suggestive of active TB disease. Minimal CT or PET abnormalities in asymptomatic close contacts without X-ray abnormalities correspond to incipient TB, which slowly and intermittently replicates. In current contact investigations, the minimal CT or PET abnormalities can be interpreted as either foreshadowing active TB or undetermined latent TB. The former interpretation necessitates anti-TB medication, whereas the latter interpretation requires LTBI management. In the latter interpretation, clinical or radiologic changes during follow-up can differentiate progressing active TB from stagnant or regressing latent TB.

Both interpretations have specific benefits and harms (Table 2). Labeling patients as having active TB, followed by anti-TB treatment, can prevent early undetermined cases from progressing to active TB and curtail TB transmission. However, active TB could be over-diagnosed, and LTBI patients may receive unnecessary anti-TB treatment, even though patients may have a chance of spontaneous resolution with LTBI treatment. On the contrary, labeling patients as having latent TB, followed by monitoring, may miss the chance for earlier treatment and blockage of subsequent TB transmission or place contacts at risk of acquiring resistance to LTBI drugs (although the risk is very low), if cases progress to active TB. Classifying these cases as latent TB rather than active TB seems more conventional and consistent with the results of the current contact investigations using X-ray examinations. However, categorizing these cases as active disease may help control TB outbreaks in crowded places such as prisons, military barracks, or quarantine asylums where TB can be transmitted massively in a short period and should be controlled without delay.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in ≥ 5 years old patients meeting the following criteria:

- likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- low or intermediate risk of disease progression

- it has been decided that testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted

- history of BCG vaccination or it is expected that the individual is unlikely to return to have the TST read.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117PdHD8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease in the United States. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active disease is the identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease.

Objective

To issue a current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for LTBI.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including evidence dating from the inception of searched databases.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation).

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^116prykY]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

TB remains the leading adult infectious killer in the world. Despite an estimated nine per cent relative increase in case detection in 2018, there are still three million (30%) people with TB who are undiagnosed or not reported to national TB programmes. In an effort to identify missing people with TB, countries have adopted more sensitive diagnostic tools, including Xpert MTB/RIF, scaled up intensified active case finding (ACF), and adapted their screening and diagnostic algorithms to include chest X-ray (CXR) as a sensitive and efficient high-throughput initial screening test.

Historically, miniature radiography for mass TB screening activities was widely used in high-income countries throughout the 20th century. In lower-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), however, CXR has been used primarily as a complementary tool to support clinical diagnosis of patients who are sputum smear negative. Following the findings from national TB prevalence surveys that have employed CXR for screening, there is a renewed interest in the utility of CXR for TB screening, and to triage people seeking care with symptoms for further TB investigations. In TB prevalence surveys conducted in LMICs, CXR has shown high sensitivity for pulmonary TB (PTB) (94%, 95% CI 88% to 98%) but poor specificity (73%, 95% CI 68% to 77%), necessitating confirmation with a microbiological test. Mathematical modelling of various TB screening algorithms, as well as diagnostic algorithms, shows that CXR followed by Xpert MTB/RIF, though resource intensive, has the lowest number needed to screen to identify a case. Increased digital CXR availability, coupled with the development of computer aided detection (CAD) software for identification of TB, has enabled increasing use of CXR in screening for TB in areas with limited access to radiologists or expert clinicians.

United States TB control guideline structure and essential components — the statement provides comprehensive guidelines structured in eight sections, including detailed recommendations for the core elements of TB control: case detection and management, contact investigations, and targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. Guidelines are provided for conducting a systematic, step-by-step contact investigation, and all jurisdictional TB-control programs are urged to develop written policies and procedures on the basis of these guidelines; recommended procedures include conducting surveillance for such activities, and reports should be made to CDC to help plan. A set of five clinical scenarios is presented in which a diagnosis of TB should be undertaken in primary medical practice, and for targeted testing and treatment for LTBI, persons who are readily accessible and have preexisting access to health care services should receive the highest priority.

### Chest radiograph screening for detecting subclinical tuberculosis in asymptomatic household contacts, Peru [^116SDhez]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Recognizing the key role early detection plays in interrupting further tuberculosis (TB) transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for global investment in that area. In line with that objective, the end TB strategy promotes the use of TB symptom and chest radiograph screening for active case finding.

Chest radiography has been widely used as a diagnostic and screening tool for TB. Currently, the impact of chest radiograph screening largely depends on its ability to detect patients with clinically apparent TB disease. Recent understanding of TB has revealed a heterogeneous period of pathophysiological transition with a spectrum of early TB states, ranging from the time of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the onset of symptomatic active disease. However, asymptomatic early states of TB beyond latent and active disease can be potentially unrecognized using current diagnostic or screening criteria for TB.

Accessing chest radiograph screening in low-resource settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, has been challenging and has hindered early detection of disease. However, WHO recommended chest radiography with computer-aided detection as a screening tool for TB in its 2021 guidelines, holding promise for the early detection and triage of TB.

In this study, we used data from a longitudinal cohort of household contacts of TB patients in Lima, Peru, to examine the frequency of baseline abnormal chest radiographs (defined as the presence of any intrathoracic abnormalities compatible with TB disease) in adult contacts who were initially classified as free from TB disease and in whom incident disease subsequently developed. We further evaluated the association between severity of radiograph abnormalities and time to occurrence of TB disease. Our objective was to assess whether baseline chest radiograph screening can identify early TB states among asymptomatic household contacts beyond active case finding.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for tuberculosis… [^1126tdg9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease, or a positive result from a TB blood test or skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease.
- Latent TB infection is diagnosed if the person has a positive result from a TB blood test or skin test and a medical evaluation does not indicate TB disease.
- TB disease is diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests, including culture.
- If any symptoms of TB disease are present, and if so, for how long,
- If there is a known exposure to a person with TB disease,
- Whether or not the person has been diagnosed with and/or treated for latent TB infection or TB disease in the past,
- If the person has risk factors for exposure to TB bacteria,… Chest radiographs help differentiate between latent TB infection and pulmonary TB disease in people with positive results from a TB blood test or TB skin test.

A posterior-anterior chest radiograph is used to detect chest abnormalities. Lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs and may differ in size, shape, density, and cavities. These abnormalities may suggest TB disease but cannot be used to definitively diagnose TB disease. Normal findings on chest radiography generally can be used to rule out pulmonary TB in a person who has had a positive reaction to a TB blood test or TB skin test and no symptoms of disease. Rare exceptions have been noted in patients with HIV whose immune status has not been restored by anti-viral treatment. Examinations of clinical specimens are of critical diagnostic importance.

### Symptom-and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111XhvVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease, reducing mortality, morbidity and transmission, and improving equity in access to care. Questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have historically been the most widely available tools to screen for tuberculosis disease. Their accuracy is important for the design of tuberculosis screening programmes and determines, in combination with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, the yield of a screening programme and the burden on individuals and the health service.

Objectives

To assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools for detecting bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status who are considered eligible for systematic screening for tuberculosis disease. Second, to investigate sources of heterogeneity, especially in relation to regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

Search Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases using pre-specified search terms and consulted experts for unpublished reports, for the period 1992 to 2018. The search date was 10 December 2018. This search was repeated on 2 July 2021.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if participants were screened for tuberculosis disease using symptom questions, or abnormalities on CXR, or both, and were offered confirmatory testing with a reference standard. We included studies if diagnostic two-by-two tables could be generated for one or more index tests, even if not all participants were subjected to a microbacteriological reference standard. We excluded studies evaluating self-reporting of symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We categorized symptom and CXR index tests according to commonly used definitions. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUADAS-2 instrument. We examined the forest plots and receiver operating characteristic plots visually for heterogeneity. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities (and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for each index test using bivariate random-effects methods. We analyzed potential sources of heterogeneity in a hierarchical mixed-model.

Main Results

The electronic database search identified 9473 titles and abstracts. Through expert consultation, we identified 31 reports on national tuberculosis prevalence surveys as eligible (of which eight were already captured in the search of the electronic databases), and we identified 957 potentially relevant articles through reference checking. After removal of duplicates, we assessed 10,415 titles and abstracts, of which we identified 430 (4%) for full text review, whereafter we excluded 364 articles. In total, 66 articles provided data on 59 studies. We assessed the 2 July 2021 search results; seven studies were potentially eligible but would make no material difference to the review findings or grading of the evidence, and were not added in this edition of the review. We judged most studies at high risk of bias in one or more domains, most commonly because of incorporation bias and verification bias. We judged applicability concerns low in more than 80% of studies in all three domains. The three most common symptom index tests, cough for two or more weeks (41 studies), any cough (21 studies), and any tuberculosis symptom (29 studies), showed a summary sensitivity of 42.1% (95% CI 36.6% to 47.7%), 51.3% (95% CI 42.8% to 59.7%), and 70.6% (95% CI 61.7% to 78.2%, all very low-certainty evidence), and a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 92.6% to 95.8%, high-certainty evidence), 87.6% (95% CI 81.6% to 91.8%, low-certainty evidence), and 65.1% (95% CI 53.3% to 75.4%, low-certainty evidence), respectively. The data on symptom index tests were more heterogenous than those for CXR. The studies on any tuberculosis symptom were the most heterogeneous, but had the lowest number of variables explaining this variation. Symptom index tests also showed regional variation. The summary sensitivity of any CXR abnormality (23 studies) was 94.7% (95% CI 92.2% to 96.4%, very low-certainty evidence) and 84.8% (95% CI 76.7% to 90.4%, low-certainty evidence) for CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis (19 studies), and specificity was 89.1% (95% CI 85.6% to 91.8%, low-certainty evidence) and 95.6% (95% CI 92.6% to 97.4%, high-certainty evidence), respectively. Sensitivity was more heterogenous than specificity, and could be explained by regional variation. The addition of cough for two or more weeks, whether to any (pulmonary) CXR abnormality or to CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis, resulted in a summary sensitivity and specificity of 99.2% (95% CI 96.8% to 99.8%) and 84.9% (95% CI 81.2% to 88.1%) (15 studies; certainty of evidence not assessed).

Authors' Conclusions

The summary estimates of the symptom and CXR index tests may inform the choice of screening and diagnostic algorithms in any given setting or country where screening for tuberculosis is being implemented. The high sensitivity of CXR index tests, with or without symptom questions in parallel, suggests a high yield of persons with tuberculosis disease. However, additional considerations will determine the design of screening and diagnostic algorithms, such as the availability and accessibility of CXR facilities or the resources to fund them, and the need for more or fewer diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis (depending on screening test specificity), which also has resource implications. These review findings should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations in the included studies and regional variation in sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of an index test in a specific setting cannot be predicted with great precision due to heterogeneity. This should be borne in mind when planning for and implementing tuberculosis screening programmes.

### Chest radiograph screening for detecting subclinical tuberculosis in asymptomatic household contacts, Peru [^1151cmLp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization's end TB strategy promotes the use of symptom and chest radiograph screening for tuberculosis (TB) disease. However, asymptomatic early states of TB beyond latent TB infection and active disease can go unrecognized using current screening criteria. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study enrolling household contacts initially free of TB disease and followed them for the occurrence of incident TB over 1 year. Among 1,747 screened contacts, 27 (52%) of the 52 persons in whom TB subsequently developed during follow-up had a baseline abnormal radiograph. Of contacts without TB symptoms, persons with an abnormal radiograph were at higher risk for subsequent TB than persons with an unremarkable radiograph (adjusted hazard ratio 15.62 [95% CI 7.74–31.54]). In young adults, we found a strong linear relationship between radiograph severity and time to TB diagnosis. Our findings suggest chest radiograph screening can extend to detecting early TB states, thereby enabling timely intervention.

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^11463rJf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, in a region of high incidence of TB in eastern China, mass screening by chest X-ray identified 0.01% (174/183,808; 95/100,000) of the elderly populations with active TB and identified 0.71% (381/27,549; 711/100,000) of future TB patients in which TB could have been possibly prevented with preventive chemotherapy. In addition, persons with abnormal chest X-ray findings at baseline were multifold times more likely to progress to tuberculosis. In this high-burden setting for tuberculosis, particularly among elderly individuals, tuberculosis detection was limited during the screening period. However, post-screening, targeted interventions based on the categorization of chest radiographs identified those at high risk, preventing the progression to active tuberculosis and reducing community incidence, thereby promoting the goal of ending the tuberculosis epidemic.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114CHPsC]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Anti–tumor necrosis factor-α (anti–TNF-α) therapy — monitoring recommendations for patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients state that a chest radiograph is recommended prior to treatment and a tuberculin skin test is recommended to screen for latent TB prior to treatment. For patients who present with a chest x-ray consistent with prior TB or a positive tuberculin skin test and/or are high-risk individuals, active TB infection should be excluded prior to treatment with adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab. For patients with latent M tuberculosis, active prophylactic treatment following published guidelines before initiation of anti–TNF-α therapy is recommended, and close monitoring for TB is recommended for up to 6 months after discontinuing therapy. For patients who develop symptoms indicative of TB, prompt evaluation for active disease is recommended. For patients with known grade III or IV New York Heart Association class heart failure, administration of adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab is not recommended; grade ratings are as stated in-line.

### Diagnostic accuracy of chest X-ray computer-aided detection software for detection of prevalent and incident tuberculosis in household contacts [^115uNbFZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Following the updated WHO screening guidelines we will continue to see scale-up of CAD-CXR screening. Our work has shown that, although CAD software is diagnostically accurate, its utility is not being maximized as approximately 30% of those with CAD scores above the threshold with negative Xpert MTB/RIF on a spontaneous sputum sample either have prevalent TB diagnosed by intensive sampling or develop incident TB over time. Further work is needed to establish how best to follow up and manage these patients.

### A systematic review of cost-utility analyses of screening methods in latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk populations [^116ug8go]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The systematic review was registered with the NIHR PROSPERO international prospective database of systematic reviews (ID: CRD42021240148).

Eligibility criteria

The target population of the review was people at high-risk of having LTBI or progressing from LTBI to active TB. Populations of specific interest were: migrants, contacts of people with active TB, children, healthcare workers, immunocompromised and people with HIV. The following LTBI tests were considered eligible: IGRA (QuantiFERON TB Gold GIT or Plus (QIAGEN, Hilden. Germany) or T-SPOT (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK) if presented separately), TST, chest X-ray (CXR). Only cost-utility studies were eligible for inclusion i.e. presented results as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERS) per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. Studies published only as conference abstracts were included in the review if adequate information was provided to allow appropriate study assessment. Editorials, letters, news articles and comments were not eligible for inclusion in the review.

Search strategy

A MEDLINE (OvidSP) search strategy was designed to identify eligible studies. The final MEDLINE strategy and resources searched (using translations of the strategy where required) are presented in Additional file 1: Appendix A. The strategy was restricted by date to studies published from 2011 to March 2021. In addition to searching the HTA database, targeted searches of the technology assessment and regulatory agency websites listed above (NICE, CADTH and ICER) were conducted.

Recent research published as conference abstracts was identified by searching Embase (which indexes a significant number of conference publications). We also checked the reference lists of any included studies and relevant systematic reviews published in the last 5 years for any eligible studies that might have been missed by the database searches.

### Can AI technologies close the diagnostic gap in tuberculosis? [^113TLiZw]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2021). High credibility.

In March, 2021, WHO recommended that CAD may be used instead of human readers for tuberculosis triage and screening for individuals aged 15 years or older. Qin and colleagues' study focused almost exclusively on triage, since 98.4% of participants reported tuberculosis symptoms, which could improve AI algorithm performance since disease severity is likely to be higher. CAD can also be used as a screening test for seemingly healthy individuals, typically obtained through prevalence surveys or community-based campaigns in high-prevalence settings or among high-risk subpopulations. Despite being resource intensive, mass screening offers two key advantages. First, it enables detection of asymptomatic or subclinical tuberculosis. Half of all people with tuberculosis are asymptomatic but often still detectable on chest x-ray, and identification of such patients early in their disease course could halt progression and transmission. Second, active screening promotes equity by extending diagnostic services to people who face structural, geographical, and financial barriers and often experience delays in obtaining care. Of note, chest x-ray is often not available at primary health centres, so reducing costs and improving access is essential.

The limited sensitivity of symptom screening — the most commonly used tuberculosis screening test — is now well established. Furthermore, a high proportion of patients who report symptoms do not receive follow-up tuberculosis testing. Although digital chest x-ray with CAD holds great promise for triage and screening, it will only affect patient-important outcomes if results are linked to clinicians and acted upon promptly, with confirmatory testing for those with positive CAD results and follow-up evaluation for those with negative results but persistent symptoms. Tuberculosis care services can benefit from leveraging COVID-19 innovations, such as digital tools for education, referrals, and contact tracing, and platforms that facilitate sharing of real-time local and regional epidemiological data to direct public health responses. Compared with non-specific biomarker tests such as C-reactive protein, chest x-ray can also help to diagnose conditions that cause similar symptoms, although this necessitates clear referral processes for non-tuberculosis pathologies. Chest x-ray does not address the demand for rapid tests to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis, but might pave the way for evaluation and scaling up of other technologies such as point-of-care ultrasound that could fill this gap.

### Symptom-and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^112RUWHi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale

This review aimed to contribute to updated WHO guidelines on systematic screening for tuberculosis, which provide guidance about whether, when, whom, and how to screen for tuberculosis disease (WHO 2013; WHO 2021a). We compiled evidence about the accuracy of the most frequently available screening tools, and where possible generated summary estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of symptoms, CXR, and combinations of those if used as screening tools for tuberculosis disease. The accuracy of the screening tools and the confirmatory tests, as well as the tuberculosis prevalence in the screened population, will determine the potential yield of any screening programme and the burden on individuals and the health service. The latter includes the required amount of confirmatory tests and possibly diagnostic tests and procedures for other conditions. The WHO tuberculosis screening guidelines aim to provide evidence‐based recommendations on populations that would benefit from screening, and on the choice of diagnostic algorithms (combinations of one or more screening test(s)) and confirmatory test(s)) in different populations and settings (Lönnroth 2013; WHO 2013). Therefore the yield of tuberculosis, the positive and negative predictive values, and the requirements in terms of diagnostic tests for different diagnostic algorithms have been calculated for different levels of tuberculosis prevalence as part of the guideline development process (van't Hoog 2014a; WHO 2021a). This information should help policy‐makers choose the best diagnostic algorithm option for their specific setting, taking into account the background tuberculosis prevalence, available resources, and other logistical considerations (for example, the availability of radiology or NAAT equipment). The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of symptom and CXR screening from this review can inform such calculations and recommendations.

### The natural history of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116s3fBR]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Stages of tuberculosis disease can be delineated by radiology, microbiology, and symptoms, but transitions between these stages remain unclear. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of individuals with untreated tuberculosis who underwent follow-up (34 cohorts from 24 studies, with a combined sample of 139063), we aimed to quantify progression and regression across the tuberculosis disease spectrum by extracting summary estimates to align with disease transitions in a conceptual framework of the natural history of tuberculosis. Progression from microbiologically negative to positive disease (based on smear or culture tests) in participants with baseline radiographic evidence of tuberculosis occurred at an annualised rate of 10% (95% CI 6.2–13.3) in those with chest x-rays suggestive of active tuberculosis, and at a rate of 1% (0.3–1.8) in those with chest x-ray changes suggestive of inactive tuberculosis. Reversion from microbiologically positive to undetectable disease in prospective cohorts occurred at an annualised rate of 12% (6.8–18.0). A better understanding of the natural history of pulmonary tuberculosis, including the risk of progression in relation to radiological findings, could improve estimates of the global disease burden and inform the development of clinical guidelines and policies for treatment and prevention.

### High incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis persists a decade after immigration, the Netherlands [^114nBqXG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The Dutch screening policy consists of mandatory screening of immigrants at entry and voluntary screening in the next 2 years. Less than 50% of immigrants undergo voluntary screening in the second year. Screening identified 41% of the patients with a case diagnosed from 0.5 to 2.4 years after immigration. Screening may have influenced the observed incidence pattern slightly by diagnosing cases earlier than in the absence of screening. However, the average delay in detecting tuberculosis in immigrant patients who seek medical care themselves (passive detection) in the Netherlands is < 3 months, and several studies reported upon by Toman suggest that the period in which tuberculosis is detectable by x-ray, but has not yet led to clinical symptoms (preclinical detectable phase), is < 6 months. Thus the incidence pattern in the first view years after immigration would not be very different in the absence of screening. The possible influence of screening on transmission has apparently not resulted in a pronounced downward trend in incidence rates over time: they would only have remained somewhat higher without screening.

In many industrialized countries, an increasing proportion of tuberculosis patients are immigrants. Immigrants account for > 50% of the incidence in the Netherlands. Control policies with regard to immigrant tuberculosis usually rely on chest x-ray screening and treatment of active tuberculosis. A supplemental approach, recommended by the Institute of Medicine, is to conduct tuberculin skin testing and to apply preventive treatment of latent infections. Whether all tuberculin skin test–positive immigrants should be treated, or only selected high-risk groups such as immigrants with radiographic evidence of inactive disease, is under debate. Adhering to preventive treatment is also a point to consider. To answer the question of why the incidence rates remain high, the relative importance of three factors needs to be established: reactivation of old infections, transmission in the host country, and infections acquired during visits to the countries of origin. These answers are essential to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Dutch screening policy and of alternative options, including other screening policies and use of preventive treatment.

### Baseline tuberculosis screening and testing for health care… [^112vqaMK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

- For example, health care personnel who do not have any TB symptoms, are unlikely to be infected and are at low risk for progression to TB disease should receive a second TB test if their first test result is positive.
- Health care personnel are considered to have TB infection only if both the first and second test results are positive and should then be evaluated with a chest x-ray and TB symptom screening. Purpose Two-step testing is recommended for the initial TB skin test for adults who may be tested periodically, such as health care personnel. This procedure is especially important for settings that are classified as low risk where testing is indicated only upon exposure. Some people with latent TB infection have a negative reaction to the TB skin test when tested years after being infected. However, if they are tested again within a year of the first test, they may have a positive reaction.

The first TB skin test can "trigger the memory" of the immune system, boosting its ability to react to the second TB skin test. A second TB skin test is not needed if the person has a documented TB skin test result from any time during the previous 12 months.
- If a person has had a documented negative TB skin test result within the previous 12 months, a single TB skin test can be administered.
- This additional TB skin test represents the second stage of two-step testing. Keep Reading: Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test Toolkit. In most cases, repeat chest x-rays are not required Health care personnel with a prior positive TB test should also receive a chest x-ray or provide documentation of a normal chest x-ray. Repeat chest x-rays are not required unless health care personnel develop signs or symptoms of TB disease or as part of the repeat evaluation prior to starting treatment for latent TB infection.

Local or state regulations may determine the requirements regarding acceptable documentation. Contact your state TB program for the regulations in your state. Conduct an annual TB symptom screen Health care personnel with untreated latent TB infection should receive a yearly TB symptom screen to detect early evidence of TB disease and to reevaluate the risks and benefits of treatment for latent TB infection. Encourage treatment for latent TB infection Treatment is strongly encouraged for health care personnel diagnosed with latent TB infection. Short course, rifamycin-based regimens are the preferred treatment options for latent TB infection because they have higher completion rates.

ATS/CDC/IDSA — pediatric TB contacts and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) management: Children younger than 5 years who are contacts of persons with infectious tuberculosis (TB) should receive a medical evaluation including a tuberculin skin test and chest radiograph, and after active TB is ruled out, children with positive tuberculin skin tests should receive a full course of LTBI treatment while those with negative tests should also receive treatment for presumed LTBI; this is especially critical for infants and toddlers younger than 3 years but is recommended for all children younger than 5 years. A second tuberculin test should be placed at least 3 months after exposure has ended, and if the second test is positive treatment should be continued for a full LTBI course, whereas if negative treatment may be stopped (AII).

### TB 101–4. chest X-ray… [^112dWfRE]. CDC (1999). Low credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA 30329, USA 800-INFO TTY: 232–6348 The fourth component of a complete TB medical evaluation is a chest x-ray. A patient should have a chest x-ray if he or she has a positive blood test or skin test, or has signs and symptoms of TB disease, or been exposed to someone with TB disease. The chest x-ray is useful for diagnosing TB disease because TB disease in the lungs, also known as pulmonary TB, is the most common form of TB disease. For adults without HIV infection, the chest x-ray will usually appear abnormal when a patient has TB disease in the lungs. It may show infiltrates or cavities. In persons with HIV infection and in children, the chest x-ray of someone with pulmonary TB can look normal or have very subtle changes. Consultation with an experienced TB clinician is recommended. Chest x-ray results alone cannot confirm that a person has TB disease.

A variety of illnesses may produce abnormalities whose appearance on a chest x-ray resembles TB. Although an abnormality on a chest x-ray may lead a clinician to suspect TB, further tests are needed to confirm that a person has TB disease.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113imv8J]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests.

Population

Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation).

### A systematic approach to diagnosing intra-thoracic tuberculosis in children [^111BJpMc]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Children suffer a huge and often underappreciated burden of disease in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries. Major hurdles include limited awareness among health care workers, poor integration of TB into maternal and child health approaches, diagnostic difficulties and a lack of child-friendly treatment options. Accurate disease diagnosis is particularly difficult in young and vulnerable children who tend to develop paucibacillary disease and are unable to produce an expectorated sputum sample. In addition, access to chest radiography is problematic in resource-limited settings. Differentiating between TB exposure and M. tuberculosis infection, and especially between M. tuberculosis infection and TB disease is crucial to guide clinical management. TB represents a dynamic continuum from well-contained "latent" infection to incipient and ultimately severe disease. The clinical spectrum of disease in children is broad and can be confused with a myriad of common infections. We provide a pragmatic 4-step approach to diagnose intra-thoracic TB in children and demonstrate how classifying clinical, radiological and laboratory findings into recognised clinical syndromes may provide a more refined diagnostic approach, even in resource-limited settings.

### CT andF-FDG PET abnormalities in contacts with recent tuberculosis infections but negative chest X-ray [^116KBSJp]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Close contacts of individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis are at risk for tuberculosis infection and the development of active tuberculosis. In current contact investigations, immunologic tests (the tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay) and chest X-ray examinations are used to dichotomize contacts with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections into those with active (X-ray abnormalities) versus latent tuberculosis (normal radiographs). This article is a critical review of computed tomographic (CT) and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic (PET) findings of incipient tuberculosis without X-ray abnormalities based on a systematic literature review of twenty-five publications. The CT and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET studies revealed minimal pauci-nodular infiltrations in the lung parenchyma and mediastinal lymph nodes abnormalities with metabolic uptake in approximately one-third of asymptomatic close contacts with negative chest radiographic and bacteriological/molecular results for active tuberculosis. Tuberculosis with minimal changes challenge the validity of simply dichotomizing cases of recent M. tuberculosis infections in contacts depending on the presence of X-ray abnormalities as the recent infections may spontaneously regress, remain stagnant, or progress to active tuberculosis in human and nonhuman primate studies. Whether contacts with tuberculosis with minimal changes are interpreted as having active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis has clinical implications in terms of specific benefits and harms under the current contact management. Advanced imaging tools may help further stratify contacts intensely exposed to M. tuberculosis on a continuous spectrum from latent tuberculosis to incipient, subclinical and active tuberculosis. Identifying incipient tuberculosis would provide an opportunity for earlier and tailored treatment before active tuberculosis is established.

### Symptom-and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^113FGpTX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

While mycobacterial culture is the most sensitive method for mycobacteriological confirmation, in practice the use of NAATs such as Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, and TrueNat to confirm tuberculosis disease are recommended (WHO 2020a). Screening programmes may ultimately be more interested in the accuracy of the whole diagnostic algorithm, namely the screening method and a NAAT to make a final diagnosis (Figure 1), which was outside the scope of this review.

In the majority of included studies, populations were screened for tuberculosis for the first time, or as a one‐off activity, which limits the applicability of the results to repeated screening situations. Ultimately, a major goal of tuberculosis screening is to reduce transmission of M tuberculosis by reducing the prevalence of tuberculosis disease and tuberculosis infection, which requires repeated screening at regular intervals (Corbett 2010; Marks 2019). In populations that are screened at regular intervals, the sensitivity of screening tests may be lower (Lewis 2009a), due to the fact that people are detected at an earlier stage of disease. We did not classify this population characteristic as an applicability concern and the number of included studies providing data from longitudinal screening programmes was too small to investigate this as a source of heterogeneity. With respect to participant selection, we considered national tuberculosis prevalence surveys, which are highly standardized in design and conduct and aim for a representative sample, equally as applicable as screening programmes that may be more pragmatic and may encourage participation of more symptomatic individuals, possibly lowering specificity (e.g. Morishita 2017a). In practice the execution of screening programmes will also vary. Lastly, our findings on CXR index tests are not applicable to the use of CXR screening as a second, sequential screening test to persons pre‐selected on the presence of symptoms. In such populations, CXR specificity will likely be lower (Burgess 2001; Chadha 2018; Masur 2017). The sensitivity of a sequential symptom screen followed by CXR for symptom screen positives will be restricted by the sensitivity of the symptom index test. Such an algorithm would, however, be less resource intensive (van't Hoog 2014a), and requires further study.

Research needs and gaps for LTBI screening emphasize that studies are needed on the accuracy of risk assessment tools to help clinicians identify who is at increased risk for LTBI and who should be screened, evidence is needed to inform which populations should receive repeat screening for LTBI and how frequently, and more research is needed to inform which screening strategies are most effective for specific populations.

Adult pulmonary tuberculosis — clinical suspicion triggers and imaging specificity: Typical features include "prolonged cough with production of sputum that might be bloody, fever, night sweats, and weight loss", and classical chest radiograph findings in immunocompetent patients are "upper lobe infiltrates frequently with evidence of contraction or fibrosis and cavitation", but "these features are not specific for TB, and for every person in whom pulmonary TB is diagnosed, an estimated 10 to 100 persons are suspected on the basis of clinical criteria and must be evaluated". The page further states that "TB should be suspected in any patient who has persistent cough for more than 2 to 3 weeks", and notes that among persons with advanced HIV infection and pulmonary TB, the chest radiograph "might have lower-lobe and lobar infiltrates, hilar adenopathy, or interstitial infiltrates".

### Policies, practices, opportunities and challenges for tuberculosis screening: a global survey of national tuberculosis programmes [^114nAktX]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The barriers we have identified also have potential consequences for TB control efforts globally. As the majority of undiagnosed cases in high burden settings are asymptomatic, community-based, symptom-agnostic, CXR screening remains the most effective approach to identifying these cases with the potential to interrupt transmission and reduce incidence. Funding and resource issues may limit the expansion of this screening activity and highlight the need for a clear investment case to strengthen the request to international and domestic funders.

### Diagnostic accuracy of chest X-ray computer-aided detection software for detection of prevalent and incident tuberculosis in household contacts [^1179v69D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This is the first study reporting on the performance of CAD in which CXR, symptom screen, and routine and enhanced sputum investigation have been undertaken to screen all consenting HHCs for TB with subsequent follow-up for incident disease. We showed that routine confirmatory testing with single spontaneous Xpert MTB/RIF to diagnose pulmonary TB captures only 30% (7/23) of total prevalent disease. Chest X-ray screening with CAD interpretation had excellent diagnostic performance to detect all those with prevalent disease (AUC,.87–.91). Following baseline enhanced sputum investigation, the performance of CAD to identify incident cases was limited (AUC range,.60–.65). However, using common thresholds, we also showed that 30–35% of those not positive by routine sampling were either sputum positive by more intensive investigations or were diagnosed with incident TB over the follow-up period, with almost all of the remainder having previous TB. Furthermore, we highlighted that, despite excellent AUCs, the recommended CAD threshold sensitivity is relatively low (71–86% for routine prevalent and 57–87% for all prevalent) and that thresholds could be lowered. Finally, we showed in a subgroup of asymptomatic, HIV-uninfected participants that the diagnostic performance of all CAD products to detect asymptomatic prevalent TB was generally superior to a range of blood-based biomarkers and did not substantially improve with the addition of any of these blood-based biomarkers.

We have shown for the first time in a contemporary setting that those who have CXR changes suggestive of TB but who are bacteriologically negative by routine approaches have a similar risk of progressing to bacteriologically positive disease, as shown in the recently published historical systematic review. Our findings also suggest that the potential of CAD-CXR– based screening is not being maximized. Computer-aided detection screening can identify a population with early, often asymptomatic, stages of TB who are not readily bacteriologically confirmed with a single sputum sample; although a proportion can be diagnosed with repeated/more intensive sputum sampling, others cannot and require follow-up and repeated testing. A number of blood tests proposed as potentially being diagnostically/prognostically useful in this setting do not appear to improve on the performance of baseline CXR in those without symptoms. These tests are markers of inflammation or interferon stimulation and may have improved performance in those with symptoms, which we were unable to assess.

Other types of tuberculosis disease

Other types of tuberculosis disease not covered by this review include tuberculosis in sites outside the lungs, collectively called extra‐pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), a condition that may affect almost every other organ and which constitutes 16% of new and relapse tuberculosis cases globally (WHO 2020), and culture‐negative pulmonary tuberculosis, characterized by clinical disease, highly suggestive CXR abnormalities not explained by other causes, but with a negative sputum culture (Maher 2009). Clinical diagnosis and commencement of empirical tuberculosis treatment is often practised in settings where mycobacterial culture is not part of routine diagnosis for people with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis disease who have negative sputum smears or often in the case of presumed EPTB. Clinical algorithms that include a trial of antibiotics and a CXR if the trial was not successful generally have very low sensitivity, while tuberculosis diagnosis based on CXR alone has low specificity (Soto 2011; Swai 2011; van Cleeff 2003). In this review, we did not consider clinically diagnosed tuberculosis as an acceptable reference standard because of the lack of a uniform definition, poor and variable accuracy of clinical algorithms, and the varying ability to establish differential diagnoses across settings. EPTB and culture‐negative pulmonary tuberculosis may be detected through screening, especially in high‐income countries, but are not a primary focus of screening programmes in other settings due to diagnostic challenges and low probability of transmission. Also, we did not consider serological tests in our review and they are not recommended for diagnosis of tuberculosis disease by the WHO (Steingart 2007).

Testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) — IGRA preferred over TST in specific adults and children: Our recommendations for diagnostic testing for LTBI are based upon the likelihood of infection with Mtb and the likelihood of progression to TB disease if infected, as illustrated in Figure 1. We recommend performing an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) rather than a tuberculin skin test (TST) in individuals 5 years or older who meet the following criteria: (1) are likely to be infected with Mtb, (2) have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, (3) it has been decided that testing for LTBI is warranted, and (4) either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return to have their TST read (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112N6Tm7]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — cough in high TB prevalence settings: For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries, particularly in high risk groups (eg, inmates, people living with HIV [PLWHIV], or close contacts of pulmonary TB), we suggest that individuals with cough be evaluated for pulmonary TB (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries or settings, we suggest that they be screened for TB regardless of cough duration (Grade 2C). For patients with cough and at risk of pulmonary TB but at low risk of drug-resistant TB living in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF testing, when available, replace sputum microscopy for initial diagnostic testing, but chest x-rays should also be done on pulmonary TB suspects when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough suspected to have pulmonary TB and at high risk of drug-resistant TB (eg, those with a prior history of treatment for pulmonary TB, contacts of drug-resistant TB cases and/or living in countries with a high drug-resistant TB prevalence), we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF assay, where available, replace sputum microscopy but sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing and chest x-rays should be performed when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough with or without fever, night sweats, hemoptysis and/or weight loss, and who are at risk of pulmonary TB in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that they should have a chest x-ray if resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Cost-effectiveness of the NICE guidelines for screening for latent tuberculosis infection: the quantiFERON-TB gold IGRA alone is more cost-effective for immigrants from high burden countries [^116PHYq2]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines for new entrant tuberculosis (TB) screening recommend chest x ray (CXR) for immigrants from countries with TB incidence > 40/10⁵, and tuberculin skin test (TST) for people with normal CXR from very high TB prevalence countries. A revised screening policy using first-line QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) in high risk immigrants was piloted in 2007. Initially, TST was offered to immigrants from countries with TB incidence 200–339/10⁵, and QFT to those from countries with incidence > 340/10⁵. When increased resources became available, all immigrants from countries with TB incidence > 200/10⁵ had QFT. Those with positive QFT were invited for CXR. 1336 immigrant were invited for screening, with a 32% attendance rate. 280 patients had QFT, of which 38% were positive, with < 2% being indeterminate. Using the NICE approach, the cost of screening these 280 immigrants would be pound 13,346.75 (pound 47.67 per immigrant) and would identify 83 cases of latent TB infection (LTBI). Using first-line QFT followed by CXR the cost was pound 9781.82 (pound 34.94 per immigrant) and identified 105 cases of LTBI. The cost to identify one case of LTBI following NICE guidelines would be pound 160.81 and using the present protocol was pound 93.16. For immigrants from high risk countries QFT blood testing followed by CXR is feasible for TB screening, cheaper than screening using the NICE guideline and identifies more cases of LTBI.
