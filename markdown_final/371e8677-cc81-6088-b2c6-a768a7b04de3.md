## Question

chloroquine vs hydroxychloroquine for lupus side effects and warnings

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects and warnings of chloroquine versus hydroxychloroquine for lupus, including how they differ and what that means for monitoring and safety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic relationship and why we expect toxicity differences. Then, I should verify retinal toxicity risks and dose-response by duration. Next, I will examine systemic toxicities beyond the eye, including cardiac, neuromuscular, hematologic, and dermatologic effects. After that, I need to check guideline-based dosing thresholds and monitoring recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state a clear bottom line with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic relationship and why toxicity might differ. Hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, sharing a 4-aminoquinoline core with immunomodulatory effects that include lysosomal alkalinization, TLR7/9 inhibition, and autophagy modulation; both accumulate in melanin-rich tissues like the retina, which underpins ocular toxicity risk, and both have very long half-lives around 50 days, meaning steady-state levels and toxicity risk accrue over months to years [^116rkQ9f] [^117BCmRr].

> I will now examine retinal toxicity, since that is the most consequential, dose-limiting adverse effect. Wait, let me verify the dose-response data: at ≤ 5 mg/kg/day real body weight, the annual incremental risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is low early and rises to about 4% after 20 years, whereas doses above 5 mg/kg/day carry higher risk and the cumulative risk can exceed 20% with very long-term use; importantly, renal impairment effectively increases circulating drug levels and roughly doubles retinopathy risk when GFR is reduced by 50%, and Asian patients more often show an extramacular toxicity pattern, which can be missed without appropriate imaging [^1136EeBs] [^116AJz7F] [^114qnBjb] [^117JGJyw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chloroquine being "safer" just because older literature sometimes equated 3 mg/kg chloroquine to 6.5 mg/kg hydroxychloroquine. I should double-check the relative toxicity signal. Multiple high-credibility sources indicate chloroquine has a higher risk of retinopathy than hydroxychloroquine at comparable exposures, and the 2025 ACR guideline explicitly states this and recommends more frequent retinal monitoring if chloroquine is used, typically every 4–6 months, especially given tablet sizes that make it easy to exceed safe thresholds [^1164rVY4] [^11589rCE].

> Next, I should review systemic toxicities beyond the retina. Both agents can cause gastrointestinal upset, myopathy, and neuropsychiatric effects including psychosis and seizures, with case reports dating back decades; cardiotoxicity includes conduction abnormalities, QT prolongation, and rarely torsades, with risk amplified by drug interactions and overdose, and COVID-19-era data heightened awareness even though rheumatic-disease cohorts generally show low event rates at therapeutic doses [^1132adkq] [^111m5po4] [^112UQUxA].

> I need to check hematologic and dermatologic risks. Hemolytic anemia can occur in G6PD deficiency, though the signal is stronger with chloroquine and in the setting of infection or overdose; both drugs can cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and severe cutaneous reactions including SJS/TEN, and long-term use may lead to slate-gray hyperpigmentation of skin, mucosa, and nails [^1132adkq] [^112JHqLo].

> Let me consider dosing thresholds and monitoring, because this is where practice can mitigate risk. Contemporary ophthalmology and rheumatology guidance converge on a long-term hydroxychloroquine target of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day real body weight, with allowance for short courses up to 6.5 mg/kg/day when disease control demands it; for chloroquine, the analogous ceiling is about 2.3 mg/kg/day, and exceeding these thresholds meaningfully increases retinopathy risk, particularly with duration beyond 5–10 years or in the presence of renal impairment or tamoxifen coadministration [^112sibq6] [^111Ax6n6] [^113XdHm7].

> I should confirm baseline and surveillance recommendations. Baseline ophthalmic examination is advised, with annual screening after 5 years for average-risk patients and earlier annual screening for high-risk features such as renal disease, tamoxifen use, or doses above 5 mg/kg/day; some nephrology guidelines extend screening to all patients after 1 year if high-risk, and chloroquine users warrant more frequent checks given the higher toxicity signal, often every 4–6 months [^114cmS8h] [^1111MEGr] [^1164rVY4].

> But wait, what if lower dosing compromises efficacy? I should review that trade-off. Observational and case-crossover data suggest that doses at or below 5 mg/kg/day may be associated with higher flare risk, and low blood hydroxychloroquine levels correlate with loss of control; this is why guidelines allow short-term dose increases and support therapeutic drug monitoring in select scenarios to balance exposure, adherence, and toxicity, while still respecting the 5 mg/kg/day long-term target when feasible [^1154sACr] [^116rsnXw] [^111Ax6n6].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For most patients with lupus, hydroxychloroquine is preferred over chloroquine because of the lower retinopathy risk; dose to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day real weight when possible, adjust for renal function, avoid tamoxifen coadministration if alternatives exist, and implement guideline-concordant ophthalmic screening; if chloroquine is used for refractory cutaneous disease, keep the dose ≤ 2.3 mg/kg/day and monitor the retina every 4–6 months, with a plan to transition back to hydroxychloroquine when feasible [^1164rVY4] [^113XdHm7] [^1111MEGr].

> I should double-check special populations and exceptions. In renal impairment, reduce the dose and increase screening frequency because higher blood levels increase toxicity; in pregnancy, hydroxychloroquine is generally considered safe and beneficial for maternal-fetal outcomes; in patients with prominent gastrointestinal intolerance, once-daily dosing with food or a slow titration may improve adherence and indirectly reduce toxicity from inconsistent exposure [^114qnBjb] [^113XSVH9] [^116XqzWf].

> Bottom line, after verifying the evidence: hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine share the same class toxicities, but chloroquine carries a higher risk of irreversible retinopathy at comparable exposures, so hydroxychloroquine is first-line for lupus; both require dose-limiting strategies, avoidance of retinotoxic coexposures, and structured ophthalmic surveillance, with tighter monitoring if chloroquine is used, to preserve the substantial disease-modifying benefits of antimalarial therapy while minimizing vision-threatening harm [^1164rVY4] [^1136EeBs] [^114cmS8h].

Hydroxychloroquine is **preferred over chloroquine** for lupus because it has a lower retinopathy risk and a better overall safety profile [^1164rVY4]. Both can cause **retinal toxicity** (bull's-eye maculopathy) [^117BCmRr], which is dose- and duration-dependent and may be irreversible [^1136EeBs]; risk is higher with chloroquine and with doses > 5 mg/kg/day [^1164rVY4] [^112sibq6]. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, skin hyperpigmentation, and myopathy [^1132adkq]; serious risks include cardiomyopathy, QT prolongation, and neuropsychiatric effects [^111m5po4] [^112UQUxA]. Regular ophthalmologic screening is essential [^1111MEGr], and dosing should be adjusted for renal impairment and drug interactions [^114qnBjb] [^111m5po4].

---

## Comparative safety profile

| **Adverse effect** | **Hydroxychloroquine (hcq)** | **Chloroquine (cq)** |
|-|-|-|
| Retinal toxicity | Lower risk; ~1% at 5 years, ~2% at 10 years with ≤ 5 mg/kg/day [^1136EeBs] | Higher risk; ~7.5% at 5 years, ~20% at 20 years [^115rRyxc] |
| Cardiomyopathy | Rare | More frequent |
| QT prolongation | Rare | More frequent |
| Myopathy | Rare | More frequent |
| Gastrointestinal upset | Common | Common |
| Skin hyperpigmentation | Common | Common |
| Neuropsychiatric effects | Rare | More frequent |

---

## Retinal toxicity

- **Mechanism**: Both drugs accumulate in retinal pigment epithelium, causing irreversible damage [^1139bC5B].
- **Risk factors**: Dose > 5 mg/kg/day, duration > 5 years, renal impairment, tamoxifen use, and genetic predisposition [^117JGJyw] [^114qnBjb].
- **Screening**: Baseline exam, then annual after 5 years; earlier for high-risk patients [^1111MEGr] [^114cmS8h].

---

## Cardiac toxicity

Both agents can cause **cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances** (e.g. QT prolongation, torsades de pointes) [^111m5po4], with risk rising with prolonged use, high doses, renal impairment, and interacting drugs (e.g. azithromycin, amiodarone) [^1132adkq].

---

## Neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric effects

Myopathy and neuromyopathy are more frequent with **chloroquine** [^notfound]. Neuropsychiatric effects (psychosis, depression, seizures) are rare but more common with **chloroquine** [^112UQUxA].

---

## Gastrointestinal and dermatologic effects

Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea) is common to both and usually mild [^1132adkq]. Skin hyperpigmentation is common and often benign but may be cosmetically concerning [^1132adkq].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Baseline assessment**: CBC, LFTs, renal function, and ophthalmologic exam [^1175KTqe] [^114cmS8h].
- **Routine monitoring**: Annual ophthalmologic exams after 5 years; earlier for high-risk patients [^1111MEGr] [^114cmS8h].
- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose in renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min) [^114qnBjb] [^114cmS8h].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid QT-prolonging agents and monitor ECG when combined [^111m5po4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACR 2025 **strongly recommends HCQ for all SLE patients** unless contraindicated, with a target dose ≤ 5 mg/kg/day to minimize retinopathy [^111Ax6n6] [^115oocWc]. EULAR 2024 similarly recommends HCQ for all SLE patients at ≤ 5 mg/kg/day, individualized to balance efficacy and toxicity [^116gw8dg].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Hydroxychloroquine** | **Chloroquine** |
|-|-|-|
| Retinopathy risk | Lower | Higher |
| Cardiac toxicity | Lower | Higher |
| Neuromuscular effects | Lower | Higher |
| Clinical preference | First-line | Second-line |

---

Hydroxychloroquine is **preferred for lupus** due to lower retinopathy and systemic toxicity risks, but both require careful dosing, monitoring, and awareness of interactions to ensure safety [^1164rVY4].

### Are the current recommendations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine screening appropriate? [^116F2dEh]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Ocular toxicity, although infrequent, is one of the potential side effects of antimalarial therapies. Current recommendations are unifocal in being developed by only ophthalmologists who do not treat patients for their rheumatic diseases. The data used to create the recommendations are meager and retrospective. Comanagement of patients with rheumatic disease who are exposed to antimalarial therapies requires a greater interaction between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists.

### A critical review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the eye [^117BCmRr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have been used for more than 50 years to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases. In general, these drugs are well tolerated and rarely need to be discontinued because of an adverse systemic reaction. However, both medications can be irreversibly toxic to the retina. A new study indicates that toxicity is not as rare as once believed, but depends critically on daily dosage and duration of use, as well as other risk factors. With attention to dosage and other factors, and with proper screening for early signs of toxicity, HCQ can be prescribed with relative safety even over long periods of time.

### Mechanisms of action of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine: implications for rheumatology [^116rkQ9f]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Despite widespread clinical use of antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases, insights into the mechanism of action of these drugs are still emerging. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are weak bases and have a characteristic 'deep' volume of distribution and a half-life of around 50 days. These drugs interfere with lysosomal activity and autophagy, interact with membrane stability and alter signalling pathways and transcriptional activity, which can result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of certain co-stimulatory molecules. These modes of action, together with the drug's chemical properties, might explain the clinical efficacy and well-known adverse effects (such as retinopathy) of these drugs. The unknown dose-response relationships of these drugs and the lack of definitions of the minimum dose needed for clinical efficacy and what doses are toxic pose challenges to clinical practice. Further challenges include patient non-adherence and possible context-dependent variations in blood drug levels. Available mechanistic data give insights into the immunomodulatory potency of hydroxychloroquine and provide the rationale to search for more potent and/or selective inhibitors.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to antimalarial agents, EADV 2017 guidelines recommend to administer hydroxychloroquine in a maximum daily dose of 5 mg/kg real bodyweight or chloroquine in a maximum daily dose of 2.3 mg/kg real bodyweight. Do not combine hydroxychloroquine with chloroquine due to the risk of irreversible retinopathy.

### Advances in the clinical use of hydroxychloroquine levels [^116rsnXw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent literature exploring hydroxychloroquine levels and their relationship with disease activity and risk of toxicity.

Recent Findings

There is no clear correlation between weight-based dosing of hydroxychloroquine and the resulting blood levels of the medication. Recent studies have shown that increased hydroxychloroquine levels are associated with lower lupus disease activity and likely also increased risk of medication toxicity.

Summary

Mounting evidence supports use of hydroxychloroquine levels in clinical practice to document adherence and ensure safety.

### The role of antimalarial agents in the treatment of SLE and lupus nephritis [^114KaMrv]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that affects various organs. Lupus nephritis is one of the most common, and most important, serious manifestations of SLE. Antimalarial agents are part of the immunomodulatory regimen used to treat patients with SLE; however, their role in the treatment of patients with lupus nephritis in particular is less well recognized, especially by nephrologists. Not all antimalarial agents have been used in the treatment of lupus; this Review will focus on studies using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In addition, this Review will briefly describe the history of antimalarial drug use in patients with SLE, the theorized mechanisms of action of the agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, their efficacy in patients with SLE and those with lupus nephritis, their use in pregnancy, and potential adverse effects. The Review will also cover the latest recommendations regarding monitoring for hydroxychloroquine-associated or chloroquine-associated retinopathy. Overall, antimalarial drugs have numerous beneficial effects in patients with SLE and lupus nephritis, and have a good safety profile.

### Toxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine following therapeutic use or overdose [^1132adkq]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While chloroquine, a derivative of quinine, has been used as an antimalarial for 70years, hydroxychloroquine is now used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In 2020, hydroxychloroquine (and to a lesser extent chloroquine) also received attention as a possible treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During investigation for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, concerns for serious adverse events arose.

Objective

We review the toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine use both short-term and long-term and in overdose.

Methods

Medline (via OVID) was searched from its inception through June 7 2020 using the following as either MeSH or keyword terms: ("Chloroquine/" or "Hydroxychloroquine/") AND ("Adverse Drug Event/" or "Toxicities, Drug/" or "Toxic.mp". or "Toxicity.mp". or "Overdose.mp".). We limited resultant articles to those published in English and reporting on Human subjects. This search yielded 330 articles, of which 57 were included. Articles were excluded due to lack of relevance, not reporting desired outcomes, or being duplicative in their content. Twenty-five additional articles were identified through screening references of included articles. To identify toxicities in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with COVID-19, we searched PubMed on June 10th, 2020: ("Chloroquine" or "Hydroxychloroquine") AND ("Coronavirus" or "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2"). This search resulted in 638 articles. We reviewed articles for reporting of adverse events or toxicities. Most citations were excluded because they did not include original investigations or extrapolated data from subjects that did not have COVID-19; 34 citations were relevant. For the drug-interactions section, relevant classes and agents were identified through a screen of the https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/ website. We then conducted targeted searches of PubMed up to June 7th 2020 combining "chloroquine" and "hydroxychloroquine" with terms for specific drug classes and drugs identified from the drug-interaction site as potentially relevant. We found 29 relevant articles.

Toxicity With Short-Term Use

Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common to occur following initiation of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea account for most reported intolerances. Glucose abnormalities: Alterations in blood glucose concentrations may occur with hydroxychloroquine but are rare with standard therapeutic use. Cardiotoxicity: Short-term use can produce conduction abnormalities. Evidence from COVID-19 treatment suggests QT/QTc prolongation is of concern, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin, although disagreement exists across studies. Dermatologic: Drug eruptions or rashes, followed by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pruritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may occur within days to weeks of exposure but usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy. Neuropsychiatric: Reported symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and hallucination within 24-48h of drug initiation. Other toxicities: Hemolysis and anemia may occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 was associated with elevation in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB activities with more events in the higher-dose group.

Toxicity With Long-Term Use

Retinopathy: Retinopathy is the major dose-limiting toxicity associated with long-term use; the risk is higher with increasing age, dose, and duration of usage. Cardiotoxicity: Long-term use has been associated with conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disorders. Neurotoxicity: Rarely myositis and muscle weakness, extremity weakness, and pseudoparkinsonism have been reported.

Toxicity In Overdose

Symptoms in overdose manifest rapidly (minutes to hours) and cardiotoxicity such as cardiovascular shock and collapse are most prominent. Neurotoxic effects such as psychosis and seizure may also occur.

Conclusions

Hydroxychloroquine is a generally well-tolerated medication. Short-term (days to weeks) toxicity includes gastrointestinal effects and rarely glucose abnormalities, dermatologic reactions, and neuropsychiatric events. Cardiotoxicity became of increased concern with its use in COVID-19 patients. Long-term (years) toxicities include retinopathy, neuromyotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy). Deaths from overdoses most often result from cardiovascular collapse.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to antimalarial agents, BAD 2021 guidelines recommend to be cautious when using maximum doses of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and when used in combination with mepacrine, due to the uncertainty around the retinal safety of antimalarial combinations.

Acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus — mild, ongoing, skin‑predominant disease despite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or topical therapy — "we conditionally recommend adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine over adding an immunosuppressive agent". Supporting context states "Change in antimalarial therapy is a common dermatology practice, as it may improve mild rash without the need for more aggressive therapy", and "Quinacrine is not associated with increased retinopathy risk and is available through compounding pharmacies at variable cost; addition of quinacrine is preferred over a switch to chloroquine, given that chloroquine has a higher risk for retinal toxicity than HCQ". If chloroquine is chosen, "we suggest every 4–6-month retinal monitoring (Table 5)" and "Chloroquine is an option in patients without major risk factors for retinopathy (Table 5), with the intention to change back to HCQ when rash is better controlled".

### New concepts in antimalarial use and mode of action in dermatology [^1127mmeu]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Although chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine were originally developed for the treatment of malaria, these medications have been used to treat skin disease for over 50 years. Recent clinical data have confirmed the usefulness of these medications for the treatment of lupus erythematosus. Current research has further enhanced our understanding of the pharmacologic mechanisms of action of these drugs involving inhibition of endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling limiting B cell and dendritic cell activation. With this understanding, the use of these medications in dermatology is broadening. This article highlights the different antimalarials used within dermatology through their pharmacologic properties and mechanism of action, as well as indicating their clinical uses. In addition, contraindications, adverse effects, and possible drug interactions of antimalarials are reviewed.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy and ophthalmic monitoring: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Dosing guidance notes, "A starting dose of up to 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight (up to 400 mg/d) followed by 4–5 mg/kg/d for maintenance is recommended. We recommend a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg/d based on risk of toxicity at higher doses". Ocular safety guidance specifies, "Retinal toxicity is low at 5 and 10 years (1% and 2%, respectively) but increases over time. KDIGO recommends baseline and annual retinal examinations", and, "Yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in high-risk patients (ie, patients with concomitant tamoxifen use, daily doses > 5mg/kg/d, chloroquine use, or eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m²) and after 5 years of therapy in low-risk patients".

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8- aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^114cmXEL]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by bouts of immune-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the main drug used to treat lupus; HCQ has been shown to reduce flaresand confer a protective effect on survival. Additionally, HCQ use is associated with reduced frequency and severity of organ damage. Recent data show that HCQ reduces SLE flares by 57% and disease activity by 32%.HCQ is classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug due to its ability to alter 'antigen-processing' by antigen-presenting cells. This is thought to decrease SLE activity at a molecular level and has direct anti-inflammatory effects.

HCQ is generally a well-tolerated drug. That said, HCQ use is linked to a number of adverse effects, which may be broadly classified by severity. While more common, gastrointestinal distress, aquagenic pruritus and other dermatological complaints rarely necessitate discontinuation of treatment. On the other hand, retinal, neuromuscular and cardiac effects usually dictate withdrawal and are occasionally irreversible.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^117FjBD9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) — harms in COVID-19 are reported with quantified risks as follows. One RCT reported a longer time until hospital discharge (median 16 days compared with 13 days) and a lower probability of being discharged alive within the 28-day study period (rate ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Persons treated with HCQ who were not on mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to be placed on mechanical ventilation during follow up (rate ratio: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.31; Low CoE). Across the body of evidence from four RCTs, treatment with HCQ may increase the risk of experiencing adverse events (RR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.49, 3.75; Low CoE) and severe adverse events (adjusted odds ratio: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.56, 2.84; Low CoE). One RCT and two non-randomized studies suggest increased risk of QT prolongation among patients treated with HCQ compared to those not receiving HCQ (RR: 8.47; 95% CI: 1.14, 63.03; Low CoE and RR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.62, 5.16; Very low CoE, respectively). Rosenberg 2020 reported 16% of patients in the HCQ arm experienced arrhythmias compared with 10% in the non-HCQ arm (RR: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.97, 2.50; Very low CoE). Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 7% of patients in a prospective cohort study in 224 COVID-19 uninfected patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who received either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for routine care. Regarding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, chloroquine and HCQ have not been demonstrated to cause hemolysis, but case reports have emerged when used for COVID-19, infection may trigger hemolysis, and "Caution should be exercised" in administering these agents to G6PD deficient individuals with COVID-19. Renal clearance accounts for 15–25% of total clearance of HCQ and dose adjustments are not recommended with kidney dysfunction.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^115rRyxc]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy is directed as follows: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy "has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus". Evidence from a 24‑week RCT reported a higher incidence of SLE flares after stopping hydroxychloroquine, with "a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.08–5.58)", and "Two observational studies reported an association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with LN, but the certainty of evidence for this outcome is very low". Safety screening notes that "Assessment of G6PD levels should be performed in men, especially those of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern origin, before starting hydroxychloroquine". For ocular monitoring, guidelines "do not recommend baseline examination prior to initiating treatment", and "yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in patients with additional risk factors (concomitant tamoxifen use; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²; dose of hydroxychloroquine > 5 mg/kg/d; use of chloroquine) or after 5 years of therapy otherwise". Retinopathy risk is quantified as "affecting 0.5% after 6 years of treatment, increasing to 7.5% in long-term users in general, and could be > 20% when treatment duration is over 20 years". Dosing guidance states, "The recommended starting dose of hydroxychloroquine is around 5 mg/kg/d (≤ 2.3 mg/kg/d for chloroquine). Doses of 2–3 mg/kg/d may not achieve adequate blood levels", and "a blood hydroxychloroquine level above 0.6 mg/l may be associated with a lower risk of LN flare". Renal adjustment is specified: "In patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be reduced by ≥ 25%". Resource considerations note that hydroxychloroquine "can be an expensive drug in some countries", and in low‑resource settings chloroquine may be considered, "but the increased risk of toxicity of the latter should be noted".

### Systemic lupus erythematosus [^1134MYYM]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs predominantly in young women, but also in children. The prevalence of SLE varies widely worldwide, ranging from about 1 in 3500 women (regardless of race) in the UK, to 1 in 1000 women in China, to 1 in 250 African-American women in the USA.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments on joint symptoms (arthralgia/arthritis) and other non-organ-threatening symptoms (such as serositis and fatigue) in people with systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the effects of interventions for cutaneous involvement in people with systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the effects of treatments in people with proliferative lupus nephritis (WHO grades 3–5)? What are the effects of treatments for neuropsychiatric involvement in people with systemic lupus nephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews or RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acitretin; antipsychotic drugs; chloroquine; combination corticosteroids plus immunosuppressants; corticosteroids; hydroxychloroquine; intravenous immunoglobulin; methotrexate; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); plasmapheresis; and sunblock.

### Optimal use of antimalarials in treating cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112W4jHq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Antimalarials have been used to treat cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus (LE) for decades. Although controlled studies comparing the efficacy of antimalarials versus placebo and other treatments are generally lacking, many case reports and series support the therapeutic efficacy of these agents in treating both LE-specific and -nonspecific skin lesions. Currently, the two most frequently used antimalarial agents are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. There may be a delay of weeks to months in the onset of therapeutic effects of antimalarials when treating LE. Smoking appears to inhibit the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarials when treating cutaneous LE. Antimalarials have been associated with a number of potentially serious adverse effects, including irreversible loss of vision. The aim of this review is to discuss the many facets of antimalarials that will help clinicians optimally utilize these agents when treating cutaneous LE.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, primarily used to treat autoimmune diseases and to prevent and treat malaria, received national attention in early March 2020, as potential treatment and prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). On March 20, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed health care providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19 when the providers determine the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the patient.* Following reports of cardiac and other adverse events in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 (2), on April 24, 2020, FDA issued a caution against its use † and on June 15, rescinded its EUA for hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile. § Following the FDA's issuance of caution and EUA rescindment, on May 12 and June 16, the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19; the panel also noted that at that time no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 pre- or postexposure prophylaxis outside the setting of a clinical trial (3). However, public discussion concerning the effectiveness of these drugs on outcomes of COVID-19 (4,5), and clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19 continue. In response to recent reports of notable increases in prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (6), CDC analyzed outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data to identify potential differences in prescriptions dispensed by provider type during January-June 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Before 2020, primary care providers and specialists who routinely prescribed hydroxychloroquine, such as rheumatologists and dermatologists, accounted for approximately 97% of new prescriptions. New prescriptions by specialists who did not typically prescribe these medications (defined as specialties accounting for ≤ 2% of new prescriptions before 2020) increased from 1,143 prescriptions in February 2020 to 75,569 in March 2020, an 80-fold increase from March 2019. Although dispensing trends are returning to prepandemic levels, continued adherence to current clinical guidelines for the indicated use of these medications will ensure their availability and benefit to patients for whom their use is indicated (3,4), because current data on treatment and pre- or postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 indicate that the potential benefits of these drugs do not appear to outweigh their risks.

Clinical Question

What is the efficacy of interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs)?

Bottom Line

Available RCT evidence on the management of cutaneous disease in SLE is sparse and of limited quality. Among traditional options, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine have the strongest evidence compared with placebo in the end points of complete clinical response and number of clinical flares, respectively, while chloroquine appears noninferior to methotrexate in achieving complete clinical response.

### Hydroxychloroquine sulfate [^111KacNu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients ≥ 31kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8‑-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.

### Shining a light on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 [^111jvjhy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Until data from randomized controlled trials are available, we suggest caution utilizing hydroxychloroquine off label for patients with COVID-19. Reports of overdoses are now occurring. There are currently no evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis, but unfortunately these data are being extrapolated to the indication potentially resulting in drug shortages for patients with rheumatic diseases who require this medication. Furthermore, we caution medical and world leaders against premature comments of treatment efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such comments may exacerbate shortages for patients reliant on these medications or cause harm due to medication side effects and overdose.

### COVID-19 pandemic – A narrative review of the potential roles of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [^115K3gr9]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old drugs used against malaria, rheumatism, inflammation in the joints, lupus, among others. These drugs showed positive results in preliminary scientific research for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Since the studies with CQ and HCQ are initial with small patient populations, it is not yet known whether there are adverse effects from the use of CQ and HCQ for patients infected with the coronavirus.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ used against viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Study Design

This is a narrative review of the traditional prescriptions of CQ and HCQ efficacy and adverse effects as well as their employment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Setting

In vitro and clinical studies comparing the antiviral efficacy and adverse effect profile of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 in adult patients were evaluated.

Methods

A systemic search of reviews, including in vitro and clinical trial studies in English focusing on CQ and HCQ effects and adverse effects against COVID-19 in the adult patient population from PubMed was performed. It included studies reporting chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine effects and adverse effects against COVID-19.

Results

A total of 42 articles published between 2004 and April 2020 were reviewed for therapeutic use of CQ and HCQ. Both these drugs showed a significant in vitro potential against coronavirus. Many studies for clinical use of CQ and HCQ showed that patients presented adverse reactions on high doses.

Limitations

Clinical studies have some methodology shortcomings, such as lack of information about the treatment and small number of experimental patients, leading to a misinterpretation of the data. Besides, there are few clinical studies with a limited sample size. Moreover, most of them did not present control groups, and some patients had died during these protocols.

Discussion

Despite both CQ and HCQ in vitro antiviral evidence, clinically, both drugs, either alone or combined with other medications, may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death. Besides, a lot of uncertainty still remains, such as starting administration period, dose prescribed, length of treatment, patients' condition, concomitant drug use, among others.

Conclusion

From the studies reviewed, it is not possible to state the precise efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ use in the treatment of COVID-19 at any time in the course of the disease. Future studies are warranted.

Hydroxychloroquine has unique immunomodulatory properties and an attractive adverse effect profile. Over the past 10 years, research has led to significant updates in clinical recommendations concerning the optimal use of hydroxychloroquine and monitoring of patients taking it. We discuss updated recommendations concerning hydroxychloroquine daily dosing, retinopathy screening, serologic monitoring, use in smokers, use in pregnant women, and adverse effect risk and monitoring. This review can hopefully serve as an aid to dermatologists and help ensure they continue using hydroxychloroquine safely and effectively.

### Recent findings about antimalarials in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: what dermatologists should know [^115Lb1Fv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimalarials (AMs), particularly hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ), are the cornerstone of the treatment for both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). HCQ and CQ are recommended as first-line oral agents in all CLE guidelines. Initially thought to have potential therapeutic effects against COVID-19, HCQ has drawn significant attention in recent years, highlighting concerns over its potential toxicity among patients and physicians. This review aims to consolidate current evidence on the efficacy of AMs in CLE. Our focus will be on optimizing therapeutic strategies, such as switching from HCQ to CQ, adding quinacrine to either HCQ or CQ, or adjusting HCQ dose based on blood concentration. Additionally, we will explore the potential for HCQ dose reduction or discontinuation in cases of CLE or SLE remission. Our review will focus on the existing evidence regarding adverse events linked to AM usage, with a specific emphasis on severe events and those of particular interest to dermatologists. Last, we will discuss the optimal HCQ dose and the balance between preventing CLE or SLE flares and minimizing toxicity.

### Hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy: a dermatologic perspective [^113PiZZM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Dermatologists use antimalarials to treat conditions such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus. One potentially serious adverse effect of these agents is irreversible maculopathy. Although there is some evidence that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have similarly narrow therapeutic indices with regard to retinal toxicity, the former is thought to be less damaging to the retina and is thus more widely employed by dermatologists. The current recommended maximal dose for hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg/day, with the weight in kilograms used for this calculation being the ideal bodyweight rather than actual bodyweight. Ophthalmologic follow-up is an important component of monitoring patients taking antimalarials. Recommendations for follow-up frequency have varied, and we present the recent guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Despite dose limitations and ophthalmologic monitoring, irreversible retinal damage can occur. Among the reported cases, there does not seem to be any obvious predictor of the development of maculopathy. The idiosyncratic nature of this adverse effect may be related to interindividual differences in drug metabolism. To understand why only some patients develop retinopathy, better pharmacokinetic models need to be developed, and further elucidation of the precise mechanism of retinal damage is required.

### Candidate drug replacements for quinacrine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112YwwDS]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with SLE are often treated with hydroxychloroquine in an uninterrupted fashion long-term in part to mitigate the life-threatening comorbidities of SLE. However, in patients with CLE who respond to hydroxychloroquine, it is sometimes withdrawn after 6–12 months of therapy to be restarted at the time of the next flare of skin disease activity. In this setting, the time periods between episodes of skin disease activity can be months to years. Thus, patients with CLE typically may have lower total cumulative doses of hydroxychloroquine compared with patients with SLE over the same time frame, thus mitigating the risk of antimalarial retinopathy.

Thus, it might be argued that in patients with CLE whose skin disease activity has not responded after an appropriate period of time to hydroxychloroquine 5 mg/kg/day, it may be appropriate to increase the daily dose to 6.5 mg/kg/day, especially if HCQ blood levels are low.

Table 1
Strategies and evidence level for maximising hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment in CLE

Long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine carries the risk of developing a 'bull's-eye' macular retinopathy. When these drugs began to be widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and SLE in the 1950s and 1960s at very high daily doses (eg, 1000–1200 mg/day), some patients suffered loss of vision. It was subsequently learnt that daily doses of hydroxychloroquine no higher than 6.5 mg/kg/day based on ideal body weight greatly decreased the risk of antimalarial retinopathy (4 mg/kg/day for chloroquine). These daily dose regimens were used successfully over the next several decades in treating CLE and in mitigating the systemic manifestations of SLE, as well as its comorbidities such as premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

However, in 2016, the American Academy of Ophthalmology published new recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Because of concern about increasing incidence of antimalarial retinopathy, these revised guidelines recommended that patients should not receive more than 5 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine based on real body weight (2.3 mg/kg/day for chloroquine). Some rheumatologists and dermatologists have expressed concern that the lower daily doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine resulting from these new screening guidelines could result in breakthrough of CLE and SLE disease activities. Increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose for previously hydroxychloroquine-refractory patients with CLE can significantly improve CLE lesions. Therefore, doses of antimalarials should be based on the risk:benefit ratio, although HCQ blood levels may be helpful, and in general, it is best to stay within the dosing guidelines because of eye toxicity.

### Comparison of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and standard of care in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: an opportunistic retrospective analysis [^111BZgMJ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a major epidemic threat that is spreading worldwide since January 2020. About one-third of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalized for acute respiratory failure will require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), where mortality is high. Up to date, no specific treatment has convincingly demonstrated its efficacy in this setting, pointing out the need for observational data that would help designing future randomized trials. Chloroquine is a widespread anti-malarial drug that is also associated with immunomodulatory effects. Hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine, widely used in the management of some diseases like systemic lupus, for which there are fewer concerns about clinical tolerance. Hydroxychloroquine has an in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and reduces viral load in asymptomatic patients and in those with a mild form of illness, without any benefit on clinical outcome. Likewise, lopinavir/ritonavir is a combination of protease inhibitor used in human immunodeficiency virus infection that has gained interest in the context of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak due to its in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-1. A recent open-label controlled randomized trial failed to demonstrate any benefit of lopinavir/ritonavir beyond standard care, but the potential interest of the treatment has not been ruled out in the specific setting of the most seriously ill patients. To date, no study has reported the potential impact of these antiviral therapies in critically ill patients despite the high mortality observed in this population.

The present report took the opportunity of successive drug shortages and compassionate uses initiated before the start of randomized controlled trials. This observational report that is not a randomized controlled trial reflects the local experience of a national expert center since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak to compare the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and standard of care only on clinical outcomes and viral load reduction in patients with a severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission.

Systemic lupus erythematosus cutaneous/mucocutaneous disease — Good practice statements specify that people with SLE should be advised on the use of sunscreen and other sun-protection measures to reduce risk of rash and potential disease flare, and that initial therapy for cutaneous lupus rash — in addition to HCQ — should be topical, including glucocorticoid and/or calcineurin inhibitors; initial therapy may also include a course of intralesional glucocorticoid with dermatology and/or a brief, limited course of oral glucocorticoid. For mild, ongoing skin-predominant lupus despite treatment with HCQ and/or topical therapies, we conditionally recommend modifying antimalarial therapy (adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine) over adding an immunosuppressive agent (Conditional; Very low; P50.1, P50.2, P51.1, P51.2).

The majority of patients with SLE in the USA have been prescribed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Given more recent guidelines, the availability of only one strength (200 mg tablets) may limit the flexibility and ability to accurately dose patients with lupus. The Lupus Foundation of America undertook a survey to assess the current landscape of HCQ tolerability and adherence.

### Hydroxychloroquine: from malaria to autoimmunity [^111ax3EZ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Quinine was first recognized as a potent antimalarial agent hundreds of years ago. Since then, the beneficial effects of quinine and its more advanced synthetic forms, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have been increasingly recognized in a myriad of other diseases in addition to malaria. In recent years, antimalarials were shown to have various immunomodulatory effects, and currently have an established role in the management of rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, skin diseases, and in the treatment of chronic Q fever. Lately, additional metabolic, cardiovascular, antithrombotic, and antineoplastic effects of antimalarials were shown. In this review, we discuss the known various immunomodulatory mechanisms of antimalarials and the current evidence for their beneficial effects in various diseases and in potential novel applications.

### Shining a light on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 [^113YPo1h]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Main text

Pre-clinical evidence

Hydroxychloroquine has been used for the treatment of malaria since 1955 and is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Currently, the potential mechanism of action for hydroxychloroquine's effect on SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 is not fully known. It is hypothesized that increases in endosomal pH may inhibit viral fusion and replication with interference in ACE2 receptor glycosylation or Sigma-1 receptor. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem effective in killing SARS-CoV in vitro. Recent reports show it also may be effective at killing SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in vitro. Unfortunately, effective treatments in vitro frequently do not translate in vivo and the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is yet to be determined.

Pre-clinical animal (in vivo) models more accurately model human safety and efficacy and enable better prediction of translational failure into humans. Chloroquine was not found to be efficacious in mouse models infected with SARS-CoV despite multiple dosing schedules and treatment routes. To date, no pre-clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

### A highlight from the LUPUS 2014 meeting: eight great ideas [^117PNSok]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A review of quinacrine therapy used to treat more than 700 patients in the pre-steroid era suggests that it is effective in both cutaneous and systemic diseases. Combination therapy with quinacrine, hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine for cutaneous or systemic lupus has been reported in several series, most notably the1959 report in the NEJM of use of 'Triquin' (hydroxychloroquine 50 mg, chloroquine 65 mg and quinacrine 25 mg). Triquin was FDA approved and widely used from 1959 to 1972 when the FDA withdrew approval of this as part of a campaign against combination drugs. Combination antimalarial therapy for lupus remains widely used in dermatology. High doses of quinacrine have been associated with central nervous system activation, including seizures and hypomania, as well as yellow discolouration of the skin; use of a low dose, for example, 25 mg/day would be expected to minimise these problems.

Even if quinacrine is safe for the retina as a single agent, is it certain that co-administration with hydroxychloroquine does not increase the toxicity of the latter? This is unknown but it seems unlikely that the additional risk would be as great as that of using an increased dose of hydroxychloroquine alone. In addition, the 'metabolic' benefits noted above are less well studied with quinacrine.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1139bC5B]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune systemic disease of multifactorial aetiology and with an unpredictable course. It can be characterised by the occurrence of flares, eventually leading to organ damage and an impaired quality of life.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), inexpensive and well-tolerated antimalarial drug, is now one of the most important medications for SLE, showing multiple benefits over several outcomes associated with the disease itself, as controlling disease activity, preventing flares and damage accrual, but also to its related comorbidities.HCQ binds strongly to melanin and can deposit in melanin-containing tissues such as the skin and the eyes, which might explain some side effects like retinopathy or skin hyperpigmentation.

Currently, HCQ is prescribed according to body weight. The recommended daily dosage of HCQ has varied during the years. The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations stated that the safe daily dose of HCQ is no more than 5 mg/kg of actual body weight per day in SLE to decrease retinopathy occurrence. The current 2020 Joint Statement on HCQ and the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines confirmed the ophthalmological recommendations. An important concern with the current guidelines is that the efficacy of the recently recommended maximum dose (5 mg/kg/day of real body weight) has not been evaluated for patients with SLE. Many past studies evaluating the efficacy of HCQ considered a dosage of at least 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight per day and it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose would be effective in controlling the disease. Moreover, this dosage is based on data from patients who effectively collected their medication. Unfortunately, less than half of the patients are taking HCQ as prescribed. Adherence to HCQ treatment is an unmet need in SLE, particularly for younger patients who may concern about adverse effects such as of retinopathy. Although non-adherence is an important issue, over two-thirds of rheumatologists are unaware of HCQ non-adherence. Low adherence rates to HCQ, if combined with a lower prescribed dose, may potentially lead to HCQ undertreatment.

### Acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity: a review for emergency clinicians [^117QKBFs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity is characterized by a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review describes acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity, outlines the complex pathophysiologic derangements, and addresses the emergency department (ED) management of this patient population.

Discussion

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are aminoquinoline derivatives widely used in the treatment of rheumatologic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis as well as for malaria prophylaxis. In early 2020, anecdotal reports and preliminary data suggested utility of hydroxychloroquine in attenuating viral loads and symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aminoquinoline drugs pose unique and significant toxicological risks, both during their intended use as well as in unsupervised settings by laypersons. The therapeutic range for chloroquine is narrow. Acute severe toxicity is associated with 10–30% mortality owing to a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias. Treatment in the ED is focused on decontamination, stabilization of cardiac dysrhythmias, hemodynamic support, electrolyte correction, and seizure prevention.

Conclusions

An understanding of the pathophysiology of acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity and available emergency treatments can assist emergency clinicians in reducing the immediate morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.

### Hydroxychloroquine: balancing the need to maintain therapeutic levels with ocular safety: an update [^115qVXTZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antimalarial drugs including chloroquine, its less toxic quinolone-derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and quinacrine have become cornerstones in the treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and Sjogren syndrome; cutaneous disorders, antiphospholipid syndrome, and have recently been employed at higher dioses in oncology. Benefits include anti-inflammatory effects, protection against thrombosis, and improved control of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. In general, both the therapeutic advantages and the toxic effects of the drugs correlate with the dose and the duration of therapy. Here we summarize the current literature regarding the administration and the safety profile of HCQ in management of rheumatologic disease and focus on the most recent revised American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines for prevention and detection of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy to help guide therapeutic decision-making for patients.

Recent Findings

The risk of antimalarial-induced retinal toxicity is better predicted by calculating the daily dosage based on 5mg/kg total body weight rather than 6.5mg/kg lean body weight and reducing dosage in patients with risk factors such as renal failure. The risk of retinal toxicity after 5 years is substantially increased even when these guidelines are followed; hence dose reduction is appropriate with long-term use. Newer techniques provide improved detection of early signs of retinal damage. These advances are reflected in the revised AAO guidelines 2016, which are in part based on the retrospective study by Melles and Marmor of HCQ toxicity.

Summary

The most important changes in practice guidelines include dose calculation based on total body weight, dose reduction after long-term use, and intensified screening with techniques including optical coherence tomography (OCT) after 5 years.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^1174i3vC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

We studied adult patients with SLE exposed to HCQ during the study period. Starting from the first visit with HCQ exposure, we identified patients receiving a lower dose or discontinuing HCQ at a follow‐up visit. We created 1 cohort to study patients from the time they lowered their HCQ dose: in that case, time zero was the date of the first reduction of HCQ dose. Patients were right censored if they discontinued HCQ completely (for any reason), as they then entered the cohort of patients who had discontinued HCQ (where the date of first HCQ discontinuation was defined as time zero). Patients who discontinued HCQ but started chloroquine right away were not included in the discontinuation cohort, as they were still taking an antimalarial. Patients were followed until the outcome of interest, end of the study period (February 2019), death, or loss to follow‐up (see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at).

HCQ use was assumed to be constant for the entire 1‐year period between 2 adjacent visits; if, for example, a participant was taking HCQ at the first and second visits but not at the third visit, then they were considered an HCQ user during the period between the first and third visits (approximately 2 years) and a nonuser from the third visit on (unless HCQ was reintroduced, which qualified as part of our outcome of interest). However, in sensitivity analyses, we repeated the primary analysis, reassigning the date that the patients tapered/stopped HCQ (from the first study visit where the reduction/stop was originally recorded) to a date 6 months prior (i.e. half‐way between study visits).

### Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Sovuna) [^117VNVjV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer SOVUNA orally with food or milk. Do not crush the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

SOVUNA is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 23 kg because the lowest possible dose of 150 mg (half of the scored 300 mg tablet) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 23 kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2,000 mg).
Pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 23 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2,000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8­aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with SOVUNA.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses

### A highlight from the LUPUS 2014 meeting: eight great ideas [^117VoxMw]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A proposal to combine low doses of hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine for long-term maintenance therapy of SLE

WJMC proposed a novel method for long-term management of SLE. Multiple benefits of antimalarial therapy for lupus are now widely recognised in addition to the traditional role of achieving control of minor disease manifestations. These include prevention of both major and minor disease flares, reduction of mortality in multiple large cohorts, reduced accrual of damage, lower risk of developing nephritis and improved outcome of treatment of nephritis. Favourable effects on cardiovascular risk have been reported in studies of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and quinacrine, including improvement of dyslipidemias, prevention of diabetes in rheumatoid arthritis, improvement of glucose control in diabetes and anti-thrombotic effects in lupus and anti-phospholipid syndromes.

The promise of hydroxychloroquine to simultaneously prevent disease flares and reduce cardiovascular risk encourages long-term use. Unfortunately, long-term follow-up of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, as documented in case seriesand as reflected by newer guidelines for prevention of ocular toxicitysuggests that doses of hydroxychloroquine previously felt to be safe (eg, 200 mg/day for an average-sized patient) are associated with significantly increased risk of ocular toxicity during prolonged administration. Hence, it is reasonable to ask whether it would be advantageous to combine therapy with a lower dose of hydroxychloroquine (50 or 100 mg/day) with a low dose of quinacrine, since, in contrast to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, quinacrine has not demonstrated retinal toxicity. Millions of American soldiers used quinacrine for antimalarial prophylaxis during World War II without ocular toxicityand a later detailed evaluation of 26 patients who received 18–102 g of quinacrine showed no retinal toxicity.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: how much is enough? [^116nmS3W]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results support this hypothesis. Most patients on stable doses of 200 mg/day (or 3.0–3.5 mg/kg/day) remained well-controlled long term with maintenance doses of prednisone ≤ 2.5 mg/day, combined, if needed with IS and/or mepacrine. Weight-adjusted doses of HCQ did not differ between patients with different baseline activities or achieving or not prolonged remission. The doses of HCQ were stable in our unit across the 17 years of entering the cohort; in fact, most patients included in our previous studies showed the beneficial effects of HCQ on survival, thrombosis and cardiovascular damage, cancer and infectionswere receiving 200 mg/day. As expected, ocular toxicity has not been observed in patients treated with HCQ for more than 11 years. Indeed, preserving long-term therapy with HCQ is crucial to assure its many beneficial effects beyond the control of SLE activity. For that, avoiding toxicity is the major goal.

Our main limitation is that we could not compare the clinical course of patients treated with doses lower and higher than 200 mg/day or 5 mg/kg/day. However, our remission rates can be compared favourably with patients from other groups receiving 400 mg/day. No differences in the dose of HCQ were found among patients who received additional drugs. Also, most of our patients were white and non-obese; while no relevant differences have been found in the pharmacokinetics of antimalarials regarding race, black patients may present with more severe forms of disease. In addition, obesity may influence the body distribution of HCQ.

In conclusion, with the use of HCQ at stable doses of 200 mg/day (or 3.0–3.5 mg/kg/day) as the background therapy, more than 70% of inception patients with SLE in our cohort achieved prolonged remission. While data on the safety of such doses are solid, our results also substantiate their efficacy, however, comparative studies of stable doses of 200 versus 400 mg/day of HCQ would be needed to confirm our findings.

### Hydroxychloroquine dose and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus flares… [^1154sACr]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine prevents systemic lupus erythematosus flares and is recommended for all patients with SLE. 1 However, its long-term toxicity includes retinopathy, particularly at doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. 2 This dose-dependent risk led to 2016 ophthalmology guidelines3 and subsequent rheumatology recommendations1 to avoid prescribing hydroxychloroquine doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. We assessed the association of this dose threshold on lupus flares. Of 342 patients with SLE who used hydroxychloroquine during the study period, 168 had at least 1 lupus flare and were included in the case-crossover analysis; 80 had a moderate or severe flare. The mean age was 43 years; 148 were women. There were 308 case periods, including 141 moderate or severe flare periods, and 420 control periods.

The adjusted OR for any lupus flare associated with taking hydroxychloroquine doses of 5 mg/kg per day or less vs more than 5 mg/kg per day was 1. 98 and for moderate or severe lupus flares the AOR was 6.
04. In this case-crossover study within a contemporary SLE cohort, hydroxychloroquine dosing of 5 mg/kg per day or less, in accordance with current ophthalmology and rheumatology guidelines, was associated with a higher risk of lupus flares, including moderate or severe flares. Furthermore, the dose trend analysis also suggested an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day. A recent study demonstrated that a higher risk of lupus flares was associated with any dose reduction, irrespective of the specific dose. 6 Together, these findings suggest reduced efficacy of lower hydroxychloroquine dosing for lupus disease activity, particularly around doses of 5 mg/kg per day or less.

Study limitations include the retrospective study design and the lack of information on medication adherence within each period. Additionally, this study used an academic medical center cohort, and future studies should replicate these findings in diverse settings.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy risk by duration and dose increases with time and higher daily dosing; the text states risk increases sharply to approximately 20% after 20 years and is much higher with higher daily dose. With HCQ use at ≤ 5.0 mg/kg, the annual incremental risk is less than 1% during the first 10 years and increases to only approximately 4% after 20 years, which is described as a relatively acceptable risk for patients being screened annually.

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^1179WLY8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The unique immunomodulatory properties of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have attracted considerable interest beyond its use for malaria and rheumatological diseases, including a variety of dermatological conditions. Over recent years, especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the prescription of HCQ has also significantly expanded, sometimes inappropriately, thus posing additional challenges on its optimal use, due to emerging safety issues. In this review, we provide dermatologists with the latest advancements on selected clinically relevant toxicities, namely retinopathy, pro-arrhythmia, cutaneous reactions, and neuropsychiatric effects. It is hoped this update can assist dermatologists to identify high-risk patients for tailored monitoring, screening, and risk minimization strategies, thus supporting safer HCQ prescribing.

### Risk of depression, suicide and psychosis with hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational network cohort study [^112UQUxA]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received much scientific and public attention during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a leading therapeutic and prophylactic target. Commonly used for autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE) and inflammatory arthritis, HCQ was released for emergency use for COVID-19 due to its postulated antiviral efficacy in cellular studies. HCQ is currently being used in > 217 registered ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as of 12 June 2020. Results to date have been conflicting, with emerging data suggesting a lack of clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Case report literature suggests that chloroquine, the compound from which HCQ was derived, is associated with neurological and psychiatric side effects when used as an antimalarial treatment or prophylaxis. Similar potential side effects that have been described in the use of HCQ include neuropsychiatric side effects such as psychosis, depression and suicidal behaviour. Regulatory authorities have received reports of new-onset psychiatric symptoms associated with the increased use of high-dose HCQ during the pandemic. While chloroquine and HCQ have multiple mechanisms of action, a major action is the disruption of lysosomal functioning and autophagy. These actions to some degree mimic lysosomal storage diseases, disorders that are characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and neurodegeneration when manifested in the more common form in childhood, but also associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in adulthood.

New reports of serious side effects associated with HCQ used in COVID-19 are concerning to the rheumatology community, leading to confusion and anxiety for patients who are taking HCQ for autoimmune conditions. Given the previous reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms with HCQ, together with a plausible mechanism for such phenomena, we performed a review of the literature to determine what was already known about the potential risks of psychosis, depression and suicide associated with HCQ use from literature database inception until 14 May 2020 (Supplementary Appendix Section 1, available at Rheumatology online). Interrogation of adverse event registers have identified potential associations between HCQ and psychiatric disorders. Case reports and case series describing new-onset psychosis, bipolar disorder, seizures and depression associated with HCQ and chloroquine use for rheumatologic disorders and malaria prophylaxis can be found as early as 1964. No clinical trial or observational study was found that had investigated the incidence of new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with HCQ use.

Maximising the clinical benefit of oral hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine

While the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a CLE treatment has been validated by randomised clinical trials, there are options to further maximise the efficacy of available antimalarials. Among other deleterious health effects, smokers have more refractory disease that is unresponsive to hydroxychloroquine, so smoking cessation is essential. Furthermore, smoking has been associated with an increased burden of CLE lesions irrespective of antimalarial treatment. Piette et al have shown that current smokers with CLE have higher median Cutaneous Lupus Erythematous Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) and Skindex 29+3 scores compared with never and past smokers with CLE. Therefore, smoking cessation can potentially improve CLE, in addition to optimising hydroxychloroquine efficacy.

Medication compliance must also be taken into consideration before deciding that a patient is refractory to antimalarial treatment. In a multicentre study regarding hydroxychloroquine compliance, 25% of French patients with SLE were non-compliant based on drug blood levels.

Side effects to hydroxychloroquine can include nausea, which may present as an obstacle in patient compliance. Best practices to optimise hydroxychloroquine compliance can include taking the full daily dose of hydroxychloroquine only once per day rather than split daily doses, taking it nightly to avoid gastrointestinal upset, or beginning with a smaller dose and titrating up. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine levels can be tested to ensure that a therapeutic blood level range (500–2000 ng/mL) has been reached, usually within several months. If compliance is achieved, yet CLE is not controlled, chloroquine monotherapy can be trialled. Chasset et al found that if an antimalarial agent is discontinued due to adverse effects, it is worthwhile to trial a second antimalarial, as more than two-thirds show good tolerance and sustained improvement to the second agent. Although chloroquine has a higher risk of retinopathy compared with hydroxychloroquine, it has been observed that chloroquine monotherapy may be more effective in some patients with CLE compared with hydroxychloroquine therapy. Recommendations for maximising the benefits of antimalarial treatment are included in table 1.

How Regulatory Changes Have Impacted the Development of DABS in the COVID-19 Pandemic

Efforts to reach accelerated approval of drug treatments and preventative vaccines in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic have included substantial use of accelerated pathways to FDA approval. COVID-19 was declared a public emergency by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on February 4th, 2020, who also confirmed that circumstances existed to justify EUAs for drugs and biological products. EUAs can be issued by the FDA very quickly: the regulations call for an automatic authorization if the FDA does not object within 30 days of application.

As of May 11, 2020, EUAs have authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, convalescent plasma, hyperimmune globulin, remdesivir, and fresenius propoven (propofol) 2% in the treatment of COVID-19. Although some of these therapies represent new advances, the EUAs also approve new uses for already established drugs — under an EUA, a new use for a therapeutic agent is not considered unapproved use of drugs off label. One of the most controversial examples has been the EUA for hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 infections. Hydroxychloroquine is an approved therapy for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, with significant toxicity and as yet unproven efficacy against COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine received FDA approval for treatment of COVID-19 infections via EUA despite very limited and controversial clinical evidence. On June 15th, 2020, the FDA revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine due to lack of efficacy.

### Recommendations on screening for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2016 revision) [^11589rCE]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine (CQ) vs hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dose equivalence and toxicity — Older literature approximately equated 3.0 mg of CQ with 6.5 mg of HCQ, yielding an estimated equivalent of 2.3 mg/kg CQ for 5.0 mg/kg HCQ. Many reports suggest CQ is somewhat more toxic than HCQ but there are no good data on pharmacologic equivalence, and higher observed toxicity may reflect dosing bias from the available CQ tablet size (250 mg), since almost any patient taking 1 tablet of CQ will receive more than 2.3 mg/kg.

### Hydroxychloroquine and smoking in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^115bf3eT]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Antimalarials, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have been used to treat cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus for decades with excellent therapeutic efficacy. Smoking seems to inhibit the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarials when treating cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), but the reason behind this observation is unclear. In addition, antimalarials have been associated with several potentially serious adverse effects, including irreversible loss of vision. The aim of this literature review is to discuss the evidence for how cigarette smoking interferes with antimalarial efficacy in the treatment of CLE. Evidence-based data with long-term follow-up will allow determination of the aetiology for diminished antimalarial response, and enable selection of the best treatment to maximize long-term remission in CLE.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113cibwM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study suggests that patients who take the HCQ dosage of 5 mg/kg/day of actual body weight tend to have more exacerbation, although the differences were not statistically significant. The risks and benefits must be balanced in choosing the HCQ dose.

However, we found that low HCQ blood levels predicted lupus flares. Our study supports previous published studies reporting that periodical monitoring of HCQ levels might allow identification of early non-adherence, improve subsequent adherence, adjust the daily dosage based on individual pharmacokinetic variability and overall improve outcome in SLE. Further research focused on defining the optimal conditions for HCQ reduction is needed.

### American College of Rheumatology white paper on antimalarial cardiac toxicity [^111m5po4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) are well-established medications used in treating systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as skin conditions such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus. In rare cases, arrhythmias and conduction system abnormalities, as well as cardiomyopathy, have been reported in association with HCQ/CQ use. Recently, however, the corrected QT interval (QTc)-prolonging potential of these medications, and risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in particular, have been highlighted in the setting of their experimental use for COVID-19 infection. This report was undertaken to summarize the current understanding of HCQ/CQ cardiac toxicity, describe QTc prolongation and TdP risks, and discuss areas of priority for future research. A working group of experts across rheumatology, cardiology, and dermatology performed a nonsystematic literature review and offered a consensus-based expert opinion. Current data clearly indicate that HCQ and CQ are invaluable medications in the management of rheumatic and dermatologic diseases, but they are associated with QTc prolongation by directly affecting cardiac repolarization. Prescribing clinicians should be cognizant of this small effect, especially in patients taking additional medications that prolong the QTc interval. Long-term use of HCQ/CQ may lead to a cardiomyopathy associated with arrhythmias and heart failure. Risk and benefit assessment should be considered prior to initiation of any medication, and both initial and ongoing risk-benefit assessments are important with regard to prescription of HCQ/CQ. While cardiac toxicity related to HCQ/CQ treatment of rheumatic diseases is rarely reported, it can be fatal. Awareness of the potential adverse cardiac effects of HCQ and CQ can increase the safe use of these medications. There is a clear need for additional research to allow better understanding of the cardiovascular risk and safety profile of these therapies used in the management of rheumatic and cutaneous diseases.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: is cardiotoxicity a concern? [^116PSHzR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral pandemic causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) begs for rapid and innovative treatments. While most patients have mild symptoms, some will become critically ill and are straining existing clinical resources in many places around the world. In addition to flu like symptoms, acute cardiac manifestations in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, included cardiac injury (7.2%), shock (8.7%), and arrhythmia (16.7%). 1

Several pharmacological therapies have been suggested including repurposing of existing drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which were first developed in the World War II era for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria. These drugs were developed before modern drug safety surveillance programs, including the recognition that some drugs can cause long QT syndrome and the ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes. The concept that chloroquine might be effective in treating COVID‐19 viremia stems from in vitro work done during the severe acute respiratory syndrome era nearly 20 years ago. In February of this year, Chinese virologists reported that chloroquine and its less toxic derivative hydroxychloroquine could stop infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro. 2 Emerging clinical trials from China and France suggest potential benefit using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, sometimes combined with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, to treat acute COVID‐19 patients resulting in more rapid reduction in viral shedding and possible improved clinical outcomes. 3, 4 However, the available data are scant and far from conclusive at this point. There is growing interest in using these agents for treatment of acute COVID‐19 as well as for prophylaxis, with clinical trials underway around the world including the United States (see ClincialTrials.gov). Given limited treatment options for COVID‐19, off‐label use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, sometimes with azithromycin, is currently widespread. Besides drug shortages and limiting the availability of the drugs for patients relying on them for treatment of some rheumatological disorders, is there the potential for other unanticipated adverse consequences?

### Special report: recommendations on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2026 revision) [^11599XNV]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy — treatment continuation decisions emphasize that patients will choose to stop these drugs to eliminate any further risk to their vision, especially those with disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis for which other effective medications are available, whereas patients with severe systemic diseases, such as active lupus erythematosus, may not have good therapeutic alternatives and may choose (in consultation with their medical caregivers) to continue HCQ as long as possible. These choices have become more difficult with increasing ability to detect minimal or "pre-clinical" HCQ toxicity, and some of these patients may wish to continue HCQ with cautious observation, perhaps at a lower daily dose, until signs of retinopathy are more definitive and or nearer to a point that would signal visual risk. The ultimate decision should include the patient and the prescribing physician, rather than the ophthalmologist alone.

### Auditory cinchonism in COVID era [^111N38sE]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The battle over coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is taking a different turn over different parts of the world. The previously austere lifestyle is taking a completely different turn, where people in various parts of the world have started to go outdoors. During the ongoing combat against COVID-19, multiple treatment regimens have been attempted and investigated, including use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and its derivative chloroquine. Traditionally, HCQ and its quinine-related derivatives were vastly used for malaria and autoimmune diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties account for its potential use in COVID-19 treatment.

Hydroxychloroquine, along with its derivatives, has unveiled its prospect in treating COVID-19 based on in vitro studies, though clinical trials are still ongoing. We are now facing a surge in demand for HCQ and its derivatives in the community as this drug is freely available. Albeit the search for an elixir to treat COVID-19 continues, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 following HCQ-treatment are now facing a new predicament, its side effects. Known potential side effects following HCQ and its derivatives include arrhythmias, retinopathy as well as muscle weakness.

### Experience with the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of lupus erythematosus [^115mX33M]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is generally used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Western countries. However, chloroquine retinopathy became a problem in Japan, and chloroquine has never been used since then. Even now HCQ remains non-approved. Therefore, the Japanese Hydroxychloroquine Study Group has been organized, and activities have started to have HCQ approved within Japan. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of HCQ against the skin manifestations of lupus erythematosus. There were seven patients, all female, and they consisted of four patients with SLE (skin lesion type: discoid lupus erythematosus [DLE] in three, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in one and lupus erythematosus profundus in one), two patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (both DLE), and one patient with a combination of SLE and dermatomyositis. HCQ was effective in three patients and ineffective in the two patients. We could not judge the efficacy of HCQ in the other two patients. There were no adverse effects in any of the patients. Efficacy was exhibited against telangiectasia and erythema. HCQ is also an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients, and it is hoped that it will be approved for use in Japan very soon.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^112hsymn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.

Methods

Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥ 70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.

Conclusion

This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

Antimalarial agents

Use of the antimalarial agents quinacrine, chloroquine (CQ) and HCQ in SLE has recently been extensively reviewed. Their principal modes of action are thought to be interference with lysosomal acidification and inhibition of TLR7/9 through binding of nucleic acids.

Two studies have assessed HCQ for the treatment of lupus-associated endothelial dysfunction in NZB/W mice. Long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day HCQ by oral gavage resulted in reduced hypertension, reduced endothelial dysfunction and less damage of the heart and kidneys, without altering anti-dsDNA antibody levels. Early HCQ treatment with a lower dose (3 mg/kg/day) also reduced endothelial dysfunction, but did not decrease the degree of nephritis. These effects have been attributed to anti-oxidative properties of HCQ, but further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism. The potential for HCQ to treat lupus-related skin lesions has been evaluated in the MRL/ lpr model, showing efficacy and safety.

American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy screening recommendations — these revised recommendations apply primarily to HCQ as little additional information has been published in recent years regarding chloroquine (CQ), and they follow an AAO-led update in which an international group of well-known experts on HCQ retinopathy were assembled and the new set of recommendations were approved and ratified at the October 2025 meeting of the Board of Trustees. HCQ is currently the preferred treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is also widely used for the management of, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and related autoinflammatory and dermatologic conditions, and is also being considered for new applications in diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and adjunct cancer therapy, which underscores that it is important for ophthalmologists and other physicians to understand the prevalence and risk factors for HCQ retinopathy.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Malaria

Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial [see Microbiology (12.4)] and antirheumatic agent.

Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Chronic Discoid Lupus Erythematosus

The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus are not fully known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following oral administration, the whole blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine at steady state is dose proportional over a dose range from 200 mg daily to 400 mg daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients.

Absorption

Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine Cmaxwas 129.6 ng/mL (plasma Cmaxwas 50.3 ng/mL) with Tmaxof 3.3 hours (plasma Tmax3.7 hours). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. Mean absolute oral bioavailability is 79% (SD: 12%) in fasting conditions.

Peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following a single dose of 155 mg intravenous infusion and from 2290 ng/mL to 4211 ng/mL (mean 3312 ng/mL) following a single dose of 310 mg intravenous infusion in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: update of therapeutic options part I [^117UCi36]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), it is important to provide instructions concerning methods of protection from sunlight and artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for patients with CLE; however, they are of limited value because of their well-known side effects. Recently, calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to be efficient as topical therapy in various CLE subtypes. The first-line treatment for severe and widespread skin manifestations is antimalarials; hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine can each be combined with quinacrine in refractory CLE. Systemic steroids can be used additionally in exacerbations of the disease. In the first part of this review, recent information on topical and first-line systemic treatment is described in detail while providing the reader with up-to-date information on efficacy, side effects, and dosage for the various agents. In the second part, additional systemic agents for the treatment of CLE will be discussed.
