## Question

Vitamin d deficiency sympto.s

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency and how to interpret them, with attention to screening and causality nuances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame symptom attribution to vitamin D deficiency versus other causes. Then, I should categorize symptoms by pathophysiology and severity. Next, I will verify adult-specific versus pediatric manifestations and consider extraskeletal symptoms cautiously. After that, I need to review guideline positions on screening and when testing is justified. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, symptom-aware clinical approach and close with caveats and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing so I don't jump to conclusions. Vitamin D deficiency often presents with nonspecific musculoskeletal complaints that overlap with other conditions, so symptom correlation alone is insufficient; severity of deficiency, exclusion of alternate causes, and biochemical confirmation strengthen attribution, while routine screening of asymptomatic adults is not recommended due to uncertain net benefit and assay variability, so I need to keep those guardrails in mind as I proceed [^111UJRQk] [^113SWNpu].

> Now, I will examine the skeletal symptoms, because those are the most reliably attributable. Bone pain, especially pressure-sensitive tenderness over the sternum or tibia, along with diffuse musculoskeletal aches and proximal muscle weakness, constitute a classic constellation in adults with deficiency, and in more severe or chronic cases can progress to osteomalacia with difficulty ambulating and even pseudofractures; let me double-check that these descriptions align with guideline and review summaries, which they do, and I should also note that children manifest rickets with bone deformity, growth plate widening, and delayed motor milestones when deficiency is significant [^114Lxtxc] [^114ssDPb] [^1114pUyw].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold-linked progression before attributing symptoms. In more profound deficiency, particularly when 25-hydroxyvitamin D is below about 20–25 nmol/L, hypocalcemia can emerge with neuromuscular irritability such as paresthesias, tetany, Chvostek or Trousseau signs, and in children hypocalcemic seizures, so I should be careful to distinguish milder deficiency, which may be largely compensated by secondary hyperparathyroidism, from this more severe biochemical phenotype before concluding causality [^1165kh6X] [^114ssDPb].

> Next, I should review the nonskeletal or extraskeletal symptoms with caution, because the signal is mixed and causality is unproven. Observational and small trials suggest possible associations with fatigue, mood changes including depression, cognitive complaints, and even fibromyalgia-like symptom clusters, but randomized trials have generally failed to show broad, durable improvements with supplementation; I need to emphasize that these symptoms are nonspecific and should prompt evaluation for other causes while recognizing that vitamin D correction may help in truly deficient individuals, even if it is not a panacea [^116tHfz8] [^111Jt2jx] [^112o28dR].

> Hold on, I should verify age-specific nuances. In children, symptomatic hypocalcemia tends to cluster in infancy and adolescence and may present with seizures or tetany even before radiographic rickets is evident, so a high index of suspicion in at-risk groups is warranted. In older adults, especially those institutionalized, long-lasting nonspecific symptoms like confusion, fatigue, and falls are common, but I need to remember that recent data show no clear association between these nonspecific symptoms and vitamin D concentrations, reinforcing the need to avoid anchoring on vitamin D as the sole explanation [^112GcyKN] [^1114pUyw] [^115BXgnj].

> I will now examine when symptoms justify testing, because overtesting asymptomatic individuals is discouraged. Let me first confirm that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the appropriate test, and that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should not be used to assess vitamin D status; then, I should review indications for measurement, which include symptomatic patients with bone pain, muscle weakness, or hypocalcemia, and those at risk due to malabsorption, chronic liver or kidney disease, bariatric surgery, long-term anticonvulsants or glucocorticoids, dark skin with limited sun exposure, older age, obesity, or pregnancy, while acknowledging that routine screening of the general population is not recommended by USPSTF and the Endocrine Society [^1123HSa4] [^11417Mw1] [^111UJRQk] [^116h8rEF].

> But wait, what if the symptoms are subtle and the patient is high risk? Should I still test or just treat empirically. I should double-check guideline nuance here: targeted testing remains reasonable in symptomatic or high-risk patients, but in some high-risk groups empiric supplementation without routine testing is acceptable, particularly when the pretest probability of deficiency is high and the clinical priority is timely correction; this balances the potential harms of overdiagnosis and assay variability against the benefits of treating true deficiency [^113zRN7e] [^113MKBT4].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach so I don't miss anything. For adults with diffuse bone pain, proximal muscle weakness, or pressure-sensitive tenderness, I should check 25-hydroxyvitamin D and consider calcium, phosphate, and PTH to characterize severity. For children with irritability, delayed motor milestones, or deformities, I should assess vitamin D status and obtain wrist radiographs if rickets is suspected. For nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue or mood changes, I should prioritize evaluation for other common causes while recognizing that correcting true deficiency may help a subset, and I should avoid attributing causality solely to vitamin D in the absence of supportive biochemistry [^114Lxtxc] [^1114pUyw] [^112o28dR].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence gaps and communicate uncertainty. No consensus exists on a single optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D cutpoint across outcomes, assay variability complicates interpretation, and large trials in mostly replete populations have not shown broad extraskeletal benefits, so I need to be transparent that symptom improvement with repletion is most plausible in those who are frankly deficient and that routine screening of asymptomatic adults remains unsupported by current evidence [^1159T71R] [^113SWNpu] [^112o28dR].

> In summary, I need to ensure that I anchor symptom attribution to the strength of evidence: skeletal pain, proximal weakness, and osteomalacia are the clearest manifestations of clinically significant deficiency, hypocalcemic neuromuscular features mark severe disease, and extraskeletal symptoms remain possible but unproven as direct consequences. Testing is best reserved for symptomatic patients or those at high risk, and routine screening of asymptomatic adults should be avoided while maintaining vigilance for alternative diagnoses in those with nonspecific complaints [^1165kh6X] [^111UJRQk] [^116h8rEF].

Vitamin D deficiency causes **bone pain, muscle weakness, and increased fracture risk** [^1165kh6X] due to impaired calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1144Ymwq]. Additional symptoms include fatigue, mood changes, and impaired immune function [^114ssDPb] [^111Jt2jx] [^113UqxEs]; severe deficiency can cause **hypocalcemia with tetany or seizures** [^1114pUyw] [^114ssDPb]. Many patients are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms, so diagnosis requires **25-hydroxyvitamin D testing** [^1123HSa4] [^1159T71R]. Treatment is **vitamin D supplementation** with calcium as needed, and routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk] [^116h8rEF].

---

## Musculoskeletal symptoms

Musculoskeletal manifestations are the **most common and specific** clinical features of vitamin D deficiency:

- **Bone pain**: Diffuse, often nonspecific, and typically worsens with weight-bearing or physical activity [^notfound].

- **Muscle weakness**: Proximal muscle weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, standing from a seated position, or walking [^1163Tpwm].

- **Bone tenderness**: Particularly over the sternum, tibia, or pelvis [^114Lxtxc].

- **Increased fracture risk**: Due to osteomalacia (adults) or rickets (children), characterized by defective bone mineralization [^1165kh6X].

---

## Neuromuscular symptoms

Vitamin D deficiency can cause **neuromuscular symptoms**, particularly in severe cases:

- **Hypocalcemia**: Numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, tetany, and seizures [^1114pUyw] [^114ssDPb].

- **Neuromuscular irritability**: Positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs [^114ssDPb].

---

## General and systemic symptoms

Vitamin D deficiency may present with **general and systemic symptoms**, including:

- **Fatigue**: Common but nonspecific [^114ssDPb].

- **Mood disturbances**: Depression, irritability, and cognitive impairment [^111Jt2jx].

- **Immune dysfunction**: Increased susceptibility to infections [^116Q4h2v].

---

## Pediatric-specific symptoms

Children with vitamin D deficiency may exhibit **unique symptoms**:

- **Rickets**: Delayed growth, bone deformities (bowlegs, knock knees), delayed tooth eruption, and skeletal deformities [^1114pUyw].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Seizures, tetany, and muscle weakness [^1114pUyw].

- **Respiratory infections**: Increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections [^notfound].

---

## Asymptomatic cases

Many individuals with vitamin D deficiency, particularly in early or mild cases, may be **asymptomatic** or have only nonspecific symptoms, making clinical diagnosis challenging without laboratory testing [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The most reliable method for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency is measuring serum **25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels** [^112zzYJM]:

| **Serum 25(oh)d level** | **Clinical status** |
|-|-|
| < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) | Deficiency |
| 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L) | Insufficiency |
| ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) | Sufficiency |

---

Additional laboratory tests may include serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase to assess the severity and complications of deficiency [^1165kh6X].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with significant clinical consequences, including **increased fracture risk, osteomalacia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain** [^1165kh6X]. Management typically involves **vitamin D supplementation**, calcium supplementation if indicated, and addressing underlying causes or risk factors [^116Tw7ci]. Routine screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults is **not recommended** by major guidelines due to insufficient evidence of benefit [^111UJRQk] [^116h8rEF].

---

Vitamin D deficiency presents with a range of symptoms, including musculoskeletal pain, muscle weakness, and increased fracture risk, with additional nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and mood disturbances. Many cases are **asymptomatic**, so **laboratory testing** is essential for diagnosis [^1144Ymwq].

### Core symptoms of autism improved after vitamin D supplementation [^115LDHt5]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. Among the environmental factors, vitamin D3 (cholecaliferol) seems to play a significant role in the etiology of ASD because this vitamin is important for brain development. Lower concentrations of vitamin D3 may lead to increased brain size, altered brain shape, and enlarged ventricles, which have been observed in patients with ASD. Vitamin D3 is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver. Higher serum concentrations of this steroid may reduce the risk of autism. Importantly, children with ASD are at an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, possibly due to environmental factors. It has also been suggested that vitamin D3 deficiency may cause ASD symptoms. Here, we report on a 32-month-old boy with ASD and vitamin D3 deficiency. His core symptoms of autism improved significantly after vitamin D3 supplementation. This case suggests that vitamin D3 may play an important role in the etiology of ASD, stressing the importance of clinical assessment of vitamin D3 deficiency and the need for vitamin D3 supplementation in case of deficiency.

### Are long-lasting nonspecific symptoms related to vitamin D deficiency among older adults living in nursing homes? [^112Vea7f]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevance

In everyday clinical practice it is important to note that low concentrations of vitamin D and long-lasting nonspecific symptoms are very common among older adults living in nursing homes. Efforts should be made to identify the possible cause of these symptoms and not hastily conclude that it is an acute cystitis when simultaneous lower urinary tract symptoms are absent, leading to unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Given the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it is crucial not to overuse antibiotics.

Numerous potential associations with vitamin D are described in the literature and prior research, varying in their level of substantiation. However, it is equally important to publish articles that demonstrate conditions and factors not related to vitamin D deficiency. Thus, even if there was no association between vitamin D concentrations and nonspecific symptoms in this study, the information still contributes to the ongoing research on vitamin D.

In future studies, it is important to continue searching for other causes of these nonspecific symptoms among older adults living in nursing homes. In consideration of a population where the average age is constantly rising and life expectancy increasing, it is important to study factors that affect the health of older adults.

### Vitamin D deficiency: a worldwide problem with health consequences [^112bmgjr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency is the lack of appreciation that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most humans. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and foods that are fortified with vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy either a child's or an adult's vitamin D requirement. Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and will precipitate and exacerbate osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures in adults. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of common cancers, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and infectious diseases. A circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of > 75 nmol/L, or 30 ng/mL, is required to maximize vitamin D's beneficial effects for health. In the absence of adequate sun exposure, at least 800–1000 IU vitamin D3/d may be needed to achieve this in children and adults. Vitamin D2 may be equally effective for maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D when given in physiologic concentrations.

### Are long-lasting nonspecific symptoms related to vitamin D deficiency among older adults living in nursing homes? [^115vcnEN]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among older adults living in nursing homes, vitamin D deficiency and nonspecific symptoms persisting ≥ 3 months were common. However, there was no association between these long-lasting nonspecific symptoms and vitamin D deficiency.

The intensity of nonspecific symptoms typically varies over time, and during episodes of increased severity nurses often misinterpret these symptoms as acute cystitis. Additionally, since 25OHD concentrations fluctuate slowly over time and potential deficiencies develop gradually, there is greater likelihood of them being associated with symptoms persisting for an extended period. Based on this reasoning, and according to the pre-specified statistical analysis plan, we analyzed long-lasting nonspecific symptoms persisting ≥ 3 months instead of symptoms of shorter duration. Exploratively, we also carried out the analysis with a cut-off for nonspecific symptoms lasting ≥ 1 month. Also with this duration cut-off there was no association between nonspecific symptoms and vitamin D concentrations.

The median concentration of vitamin D and interquartile ranges were similar across groups (Table 1). In the regression analysis (Table 2), vitamin D was treated as a continuous variable. This approach allows to maximize the use of all available data points, while adjusting for confounders like dementia (Table 2). An alternative method of categorizing vitamin D levels into predefined cut-off values would result in a loss of data granularity. For this reason, vitamin D was treated as a continuous variable. Given that none of the p -values in Table 2 were close to statistical significance and that the median values between groups were similar (Table 1), it is unlikely that dividing the data into categorical cut-offs would yield a different result. Furthermore, exploratory analyses using different cut-off levels would generate numerous p -values, raising the risk of type I errors due to multiple testing.

Due to the data being 10 years old the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency today may differ. However, the aim of this sub-study was not to describe the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, but rather to investigate any association between low concentrations of vitamin D and presence of symptoms. Therefore, the conclusions are not influenced by potential changes in vitamin D supplementation over the years or the current prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, there is no recommendation for general supplementation with vitamin D of all residents in nursing homes in Sweden.

Table 4 — Vitamin D deficiency (Vitamin D3 preferred) symptoms and dosing — children and adults: Listed symptoms are Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, Rickets, and tetany in children. Children repletion is 4000–8000 IU daily and maintenance is 400–2000 IU daily. Adult repletion by baseline level is Serum 25(OH)D < 12 ng/ml: 50,000 IU weekly × 8 weeks; Serum 25(OH)D 12–20 ng/ml: 800–1000 IU daily; Serum 25(OH)D 20–30 ng/ml: 600–800 IU daily. Adult maintenance displays 800 IU daily, 800–1000 IU daily, and 600–800 IU daily. May require higher doses or use of hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites. Vitamin D3 should be used for treatment and supplementation due to its greater bioavailability and affinity for vitamin D–binding protein.

### Correlation of symptoms with vitamin D deficiency and symptom response to cholecalciferol treatment: a randomized controlled trial [^116tHfz8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association of symptoms with vitamin D deficiency and symptom response to cholecalciferol treatment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

Adult primary care patients in Duluth, Minnesota, were screened for vitamin D deficiency in February 2007. Participants completed questionnaires pertaining to a variety of symptoms, vitamin D intake, and selected medical conditions. Patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 10–25 ng/mL) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin D replacement and its effect on symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 000 units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) weekly or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D < 10 ng/mL) were treated in an unblinded fashion, and symptoms were reevaluated post treatment.

Results

A total of 610 patients underwent initial screening, and 100 patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency participated in the RCT. Thirty-eight severely deficient patients were treated in an unblinded fashion. On initial screening, 46.2% of participants were deficient in vitamin D. Self-reported vitamin D supplementation, milk intake, celiac disease, gastric bypass, and chronic pancreatitis were predictive of vitamin D status. Severely deficient participants reported increased musculoskeletal symptoms, depression (including seasonal), and higher (worse) scores on a fibromyalgia assessment questionnaire. In the RCT, the treated group showed significant improvement in fibromyalgia assessment scores (P = 0.03), whereas the placebo-treated participants did not. Severely deficient patients did not show symptom improvement over the 8-week trial period or when followed up 1 year later.

Conclusions

Compared with participants in the placebo group, patients in the treatment group showed mild short-term improvement in the overall fibromyalgia impact score, but did not show significant improvement in most musculoskeletal symptoms or in activities of daily living.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113mKtpB]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults states that for asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency (I statement). It applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended and does not apply to persons who are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes. Implementation notes add that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for vitamin D deficiency, and the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF statement.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Vitamin D deficiency in burn patients [^112As99z]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in pediatric burn patients; however, no formal studies have been conducted in adult burn populations. The available literature on vitamin D status in burn patients has been reviewed. A literature search was conducted using Medline™, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and EMBASE to identify any trials of vitamin D deficiency in burn patients. Six published studies regarding vitamin D status in burn patients were found; however, five of these were in pediatric populations and several did not assess vitamin D levels as a major endpoint. Vitamin D deficiency has been demonstrated to result in itching, muscle weakness, and neuropathy, all of which are common postburn sequelae. The major source of vitamin D is synthesis in the skin with a small amount being absorbed through dietary intake. Population groups are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency if they have inadequate exposure to UV light or reduced biosynthetic capability due to skin damage. Burn patients fall into both risk groups and also suffer common complaints that overlap with those reported by patients with vitamin D deficiency. Further research in adult burn patients is needed to determine the prevalence of deficiency in this population and whether vitamin D deficiency might influence postburn injury symptoms reported by patients.

### Vitamin D and depression [^111Jt2jx]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with depression and whether vitamin D supplementation is an effective treatment for depression.

Method

Empirical papers published in recent years were identified using three search engines and online databases - PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database. Specific search terms used were 'vitamin D', 'depression' and 'treatment' and articles were selected that examined the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and depression, vitamin D supplementation and Vitamin D as a treatment for depression. Our review weighted more recent studies (from 2011), although also considered earlier publications.

Results

Empirical studies appear to provide increasing evidence for an association between vitamin D insufficiency and depression, and for vitamin D supplementation and augmentation in those with clinical depression who are vitamin D deficient. Methodological limitations associated with many of the studies are detailed.

Limitations

Articles were restricted to those in the English language while publication bias may have weighted studies with positive findings.

Conclusions

There remains a need for empirical studies to move beyond cross-sectional designs to undertake more randomised controlled longitudinal trials so as to clarify the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of depression and its management, as well as to establish whether currently suggested associations are clinically significant and distinctive.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

### Primary vitamin D deficiency in adults [^113XiuF2]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

In adults, prolonged deficiency of vitamin D (calciferol) can lead to osteomalacia, while lesser deficiency (insufficiency) is associated with various non-specific symptoms. Both vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are becoming more common in developed countries. In the UK, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in all adults is around 14.5%, and may be more than 30% in those over 65 years old and as high as 94% in otherwise healthy south Asian adults. By comparison, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in adults may be as high as 55%, and the condition is even more common in patients with osteoporotic fractures. Recently, we discussed the management of children with primary vitamin D deficiency. Here we review the management of adults with the condition.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### Osteomalacia as a result of vitamin D deficiency [^112MUsjc]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Osteomalacia is an end-stage bone disease of chronic and severe vitamin D or phosphate depletion of any cause. Its importance has increased because of the rising incidence of vitamin D deficiency. Yet, not all cases of osteomalacia are cured by vitamin D replacement, and furthermore, not all individuals with vitamin D deficiency develop osteomalacia. Although in the past osteomalacia was commonly caused by malabsorption, nutritional deficiency now is more common. In addition, recent literature suggests that nutritional vitamin D deficiency osteomalacia follows various bariatric surgeries for morbid obesity. Bone pain, tenderness, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking are all common clinical manifestations of osteomalacia. Diagnostic work-up involves biochemical assessment of vitamin D status and may also include a transiliac bone biopsy. Treatment is based on aggressive vitamin D repletion in most cases with follow-up biopsies if patients are started on antiresorptive or anabolic agents.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^112o28dR]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

"RCTs using vitamin D supplementation to prevent or improve possible nonskeletal diseases related to poor vitamin D status have generated mixed results".

There is also general consensus that severe vitamin D deficiency or absence of 1,25(OH) 2 D (as in chronic renal failure) later in life can cause osteomalacia. Milder degrees of vitamin D deficiency generate secondary hyperparathyroidism in most but not all subjects of various ages and accelerates bone turnover and ultimately accelerates bone loss and the risk of fractures in the elderly.

In selected populations, RCTs with vitamin D and calcium supplementation demonstrated a decreased incidence of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures of ∼15%, with the effect being greater (i) in 80+ and 70 to 80 years of age persons than in persons 60 to 70 years of age, (ii) in those who are institutionalized in comparison with community living elderly, (iii) when vitamin D is combined with calcium supplementation, and (4) when compliance is > 80%. Nearly all major governmental guidelines confirm this policy and recommend that serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L should be avoided. Some expert groups (UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition), however, consider this conclusion still not sufficiently validated to recommend specific supplementation beyond what is needed to prevent rickets/osteomalacia. Other experts and grassroots organizations recommend much higher intake and aim for much higher serum 25OHD concentrations based on observational data and comparison with serum 25OHD levels in individuals living in circumstances similar to those of early humans.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### Undiagnosed vitamin D deficiency in the hospitalized patient [^115WDgHZ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency among hospitalized patients may be more widespread than realized. Vague musculoskeletal complaints in these chronically ill patients may be attributed to multiple underlying disease processes rather than a deficiency in vitamin D. However, the failure to diagnose an underlying deficiency places the patient at risk for continued pain, weakness, secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, and fractures. The causes of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia in the chronically ill patient are many, and the patient may respond to simple replacement therapy. Elderly hospitalized patients with ionized hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, with or without an elevated parathyroid hormone level, are most likely deficient in vitamin D. Initiating treatment during hospitalization is reasonable once the diagnosis has been confirmed by finding a low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. Treatment with high doses of vitamin D is safe. Unfortunately, some hospital formularies continue to provide multivitamin supplements that contain less vitamin D than currently is recommended.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

National guidance on the management of vitamin D

Unsurprisingly, this has led to controversy and confusion in the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to help will clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians and other practising clinicians containing key recommendations around
best way of estimating vitamin D status;
recommendations for vitamin D testing;
threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency;
treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on maintenance therapy;
guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance, and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of their patients.

Key points

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high world-wide, particularly in the elderly.
25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
Muscle weakness due to vitamin deficiency is reversible with vitamin D supplementation.
Recent National guidance has been published on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK.

### Does low vitamin D status contribute to "age-related" morbidity? [^111AicAy]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

It is increasingly appreciated that vitamin D plays important physiological roles beyond the musculoskeletal system. As such, it is plausible that endemic vitamin D deficiency contributes to much nonskeletal morbidity that adversely affects quality of life with advancing age among older adults. This overview will explore the evidence for, and potential involvement of, vitamin D deficiency in nonbone conditions that are currently accepted as "age-related" morbidity among older adults.

### Prevalence and correlates of vitamin D deficiency in adults after traumatic brain injury [^116PQxqJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D status is best assessed using serum 25‐hydroxy‐cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D3, concentration, as this is the major circulating form of vitamin D with a long half‐life of 2–3 weeks. 15 United Kingdom national surveys suggest that approximately 20% of adults can have low vitamin D status, 16 with seasonal variation meaning that in winter this can reach 50% of White adults. 17 Levels are also lower in subjects with darker skin as melanin absorbs UV‐B radiation from sunlight. 18 Vitamin D status can be classified as replete, insufficient or deficient, using established criteria (Table S1).

However, there are no published clinical data on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients after TBI or its association with poorer clinical outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency after TBI, and whether it is associated with severity of TBI, greater cognitive impairment, worse symptoms and quality of life.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

### Golden opportunity for intervention? Identifying vitamin D deficiency in patients with substance use disorders in hospital [^112hzEdV]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

A recent review of evidence assessing vitamin D status and vulnerability to coronavirus infection found no direct evidence related to vitamin D deficiency predisposing to coronavirus. However, it did state that current advice is that the whole population of the UK should take vitamin D supplements to prevent vitamin D deficiency, irrespective of any possible link with respiratory infection. The review concluded that clinicians should treat patients with vitamin D deficiency regardless of any link with respiratory infection.

Our hospital guidelines state that individuals at particular risk of vitamin D deficiency should be offered routine replacement treatment. They also advise that patients with the combination of one or more risk factors for vitamin D deficiency as well as symptoms/signs of vitamin D deficiency should be offered a vitamin D level check. Local and national guidelines suggest that everyone living the UK should take daily over-the-counter vitamin D supplements of 10 µg/400 IU between October and March.

Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency listed in the local guidelines are numerous, including deranged liver function and 'mental health conditions'. Nevertheless, they do not explicitly mention SUD. This omission is contrary to evidence already referenced, in that being a patient in addictions services is itself a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency.

Symptoms and signs of vitamin D deficiency are non-specific and can be easily missed. Vitamin D levels are easy to check with a simple blood test. Replacement of vitamin D is straightforward, safe and inexpensive.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### Vitamin D screening and supplementation in community-dwelling adults: common questions and answers [^115iKZP4]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin D levels and supplementation with oral vitamin D have become commonplace, although clinical trials have not demonstrated health benefits. The usefulness of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to assess adequate exposure to vitamin D is hampered by variations in measurement technique and precision. Serum levels less than 12 ng per mL reflect inadequate vitamin D intake for bone health. Levels greater than 20 ng per mL are adequate for 97.5% of the population. Routine vitamin D supplementation does not prolong life, decrease the incidence of cancer or cardiovascular disease, or decrease fracture rates. Screening asymptomatic individuals for vitamin D deficiency and treating those considered to be deficient do not reduce the risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or death in community-dwelling adults, or fractures in persons not at high risk of fractures. Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of depression, fatigue, osteoarthritis, and chronic pain show no benefit, even in persons with low levels at baseline.

A practical tool is "serum ALP, which if elevated for age should be followed with measurements of serum 25(OH)-D, calcium, phosphorus, and PTH", along with "radiologic examination of the distal ends of (1) the radius and ulna (wrist anteroposterior view) or (2) tibia and femur (knee anteroposterior view)"; reference ranges note "ALP levels are usually < 500 IU/L in neonates and < 1000 IU/L in children up to 9 years of age", and "the wrist radiograph may be the most reliable test for detecting subclinical rickets".

### Presentation of vitamin D deficiency [^112GcyKN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To describe the various ways in which vitamin D deficiency presents in children in selected districts of London and to identify which factors, if any, determine the mode of presentation.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients presenting to Newham General, Royal London, Great Ormond Street, and King's College Hospitals between 1996 and 2001 with either hypocalcaemia or rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency. Children with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 25 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) were considered to have vitamin D deficiency.

Results

Sixty five children, mostly from Black or Asian ethnic minority groups, were identified, 29 of whom had hypocalcaemic symptoms. Seventeen of these had no radiological evidence of rickets. The remainder (48 children) had radiological evidence of rickets with or without clinical signs. Symptoms and signs reverted to normal in all cases with vitamin D supplementation. All children who presented with symptomatic hypocalcaemia were aged either < 3 or > 10 years. There was a strong correlation between age at presentation and population growth velocity reference data.

Conclusions

Rickets remains a problem in the UK especially in "at risk" ethnic minority groups. Symptomatic hypocalcaemia is an important, but under-recognised presenting feature. Growth rate is likely to be an important factor in determining the mode of presentation. Unexplained hypocalcaemia should be attributed to vitamin D deficiency in "at risk" ethnic minority groups until proved otherwise.

### Editorial commentary: is vitamin D the new wheaties? Preventing muscle fatigue could keep athletes in the game [^114zq2mS]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is an oft overlooked and underevaluated condition that is widespread in patient-athletes, including the elite and professional. Although the symptomatology of this deficiency is well known in the general population (osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture), the symptom of muscle fatigue is not. It is only recently that the association between vitamin D deficiency and muscle fatigue in professional athletes has been placed in the spotlight. However, vitamin D deficiency should be of increasing concern for orthopaedists in regard to all athletes. In the elite collegiate/professional ranks, this condition may lead to detrimental injuries with career-altering effects. Although this condition may not affect career and financial well-being for most patients, modifications in athletic performance and lifestyle are still of utmost value to any athlete. Although I do not condone ordering vitamin D levels as a screening tool, nor broadly prescribing supplements to all patient-athletes, I do believe that it is warranted if certain "high-risk" criteria are met.

### IOM committee members respond to endocrine society vitamin D guideline [^113736uM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

### Therapeutic and mechanistic intervention of vitamin D in neuropsychiatric disorders [^117JVPcG]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is believed to affect between 35 and 55% of the world's population, making it a hidden pandemic. In addition to its role in bone and calcium homeostasis, vitamin D has also been linked in preclinical and clinical research to brain function. These outcomes have also been used for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental problems. Nevertheless, these individuals are more prone to develop signs of cognitive decline. This review will emphasize the association between vitamin D and neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism, schizophrenia, depression, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While numerous research show vitamin D's essential role in cognitive function in neuropsychiatric illnesses, it is too early to propose its effect on cognitive symptoms with certainty. It is necessary to conduct additional research into the associations between vitamin D deficiency and cognitive abnormalities, particularly those found in autism, schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD, to develop initiatives that address the pressing need for novel and effective preventative therapeutic strategies.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115GCzBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### Association of vitamin D status and other clinical characteristics with COVID-19 test results [^111TQZH1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, associated with test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 489 patients who had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status, a difference that was statistically significant.

Meaning

These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

Regarding medical management for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D supplementation, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider initiating higher dose (2–3 times higher; at least 6,000–10,000 IU/day) of vitamin D, followed by maintenance therapy of 3,000–6,000 IU/day, in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, or on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism, to treat vitamin D deficiency to maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

### Undiagnosed vitamin D deficiency in the hospitalized patient… [^114ssDPb]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia present with classic findings of neuromuscular irritability, including numbness, paresthesias, muscle cramps, laryngospasm, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's phenomenon, tetany, and seizures. 1 By contrast, patients with mild vitamin D deficiency present with more subtle complaints such as muscle weakness or pain. Finding only a modest reduction in a patient's calcium or phosphate level should not reassure the physician that all is well. When vitamin D deficiency is the cause of hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia, replacing calcium or phosphate alone does not restore the body to homeostasis. 2, 3. Prolonged asymptomatic hypocalcemia from deficient vitamin D production or absorption stimulates the release of parathyroid hormone. If vitamin D is not provided, secondary hyperparathyroidism develops with increased bone turnover and decreased bone mineralization.

2 The adult patient with severe vitamin D depletion develops osteomalacia and presents with localized bone pain, antigravity muscle weakness, difficulty rising from a chair or walking, and pseudofractures. 3, 7. She was discharged to the nursing home on low-flow oxygen therapy. On readmission, she had a weak cough and required vigorous tracheal suctioning through her tracheostomy tube. Depressed levels of serum calcium and phosphate resistant to vigorous oral and intravenous replacement were noted on both hospital admissions. As both hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia worsen, the calcium-phosphate product is no longer adequate to mineralize bone properly. Osteoblasts deposit a poorly mineralized collagen, a rubbery matrix that provides inadequate skeletal support. Painful osteomalacia is caused by the activation of periosteal sensory pain fibers deformed by weakened and poorly calcified bones.

10 Diagnosis and Treatment VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY The findings of muscle weakness and pain on physical examination are nonspecific, and often are misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. 10 The most sensitive test to diagnose vitamin D deficiency is the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. 2, 3, 7 PTH levels are normal in early or mild vitamin D deficiency. 2 Only later do the findings of prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism present. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia may range from fatigue and irritability to seizures and acute respiratory failure.

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25–40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

### Rickets: part I [^116Xu1YU]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Rickets is characterized by impaired mineralization and ossification of the growth plates of growing children caused by a variety of disorders, the most frequent of which is nutritional deficiency of vitamin D. Despite ample knowledge of its etiology and the availability of cost-effective methods of preventing it, vitamin D deficiency rickets remains a significant problem in developing and developed countries. This two-part review covers the history, etiology, pathophysiology and clinical and radiographical findings of vitamin D deficiency rickets. Other less frequent causes of rickets and some of the disorders entering into the differential diagnoses of rickets are also considered. Controversial issues surrounding vitamin D deficiency include determination of what constitutes vitamin D sufficiency and the potential relationship between low levels of vitamin D metabolites in many individuals and unexplained fractures in infants.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1145ZUz5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

Vitamin D levels and population prevalence — The document states that "no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency". It reports that "an estimated 97.5% of the population will have their vitamin D needs met at a serum level of 20 ng/mL (49.9 nmol/L) and risk for deficiency, relative to bone health, begins to occur at levels less than 12 to 20 ng/mL (29.9–49.9 nmol/L)". Additionally, a report based on 2014 survey data found that 5% of persons 1 year or older had very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels (< 12 ng/mL) and 18% had levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- Definition: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- Disease course: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Vitamin D, chronic pain, and depression: linear and non-linear mendelian randomization analyses [^1128VsUF]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency, defined as low levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), has been linked to recurrent and chronic pain conditions. Profound vitamin D deficiency is strongly linked to pain from osteomalacia, a bone weakening disorder. Low vitamin D levels have also been suggested to play a role in the aetiology of chronic pain states through their influence on bone biology, autoimmune diseases, inflammation, or neuromuscular and other immunological influences on pain manifestation. Empirical evidence from observational studies indicates hypovitaminosis D to be highly prevalent in patients with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and depression.

However, evidence for a direct causal link between low 25(OH)D levels and chronic pain conditions is incomplete. Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D as a treatment for chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia, have generally shown no evidence of benefit, but most were limited in size and quality. In contrast, systematic reviews of randomized trials for depression, depressive symptoms, and negative emotions have indicated beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation, although no evidence for an effect was observed in the large Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL). A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that vitamin D levels have a threshold effect on depression, which was not detected in the VITAL trial as many participants in the control arm had adequate vitamin D levels. Inverse associations have also been observed in observational epidemiological studies, although such investigations are vulnerable to bias from confounding and reverse causality: individuals with depression could have low vitamin D levels due to spending less time outdoors or changes in appetite and diet.

### Vitamin D deficiency-the once and present epidemic… [^111andMo]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

When the human body is deficient in vitamin D because of reduced dietary intake or inadequate exposure to sunlight, the parathyroid hormone mobilizes calcium from its stores in the skeleton to restore calcium balance in the blood. While this action prevents the usual manifestations of hypocalcemia until vitamin D deficiency is quite severe, adults who are deficient in vitamin D may have chronic pain and lower extremity weakness. Indeed, women who are deficient in vitamin D often are misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia or even somatization syndromes. Technically, vitamin D is not a vitamin but a steroid hormone that stimulates the vitamin D receptor in the cell nucleus to upregulate gene expression. The result of this stimulation is an increase in the absorption of calcium from the small intestine. Without adequate vitamin D, the body absorbs no more than 15 percent of dietary calcium.

With sufficient vitamin D, calcium absorption increases to 30 percent and, during pregnancy or lactation and in periods of growth, absorption can approach 80 percent. 3 One reason physicians discount the possibility of vitamin D deficiency is that they assume their patient has had plenty of sun exposure or adequate dietary intake. However, many patients actively avoid the sun or scrupulously use sunscreen in an effort to reduce their risk of developing skin cancer. In addition, as some patients age and become more homebound, they do not go out in the sun as much. 4 Some people take in more vitamin D than is recommended and still are deficient in vitamin D. The results of one study 5 of patients in a Boston hospital showed that 37 percent of those with intakes exceeding recommended amounts had subnormal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. When reduced sun exposure is combined with inadequate dietary intake, vitamin D deficiency is found to be much more widespread than previously was thought.

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be as high as 21 to 58 percent in adolescents and adults in the United States. Physicians should consider checking serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients at risk for deficiency and in those suspected of being deficient in vitamin D. This is the most reliable test for vitamin D status. Symptomatic patients, such as those with unexplained muscle weakness or pain also should be evaluated for vitamin D deficiency. 9 The results of recent reports give physicians another opportunity to improve the well-being of many of our chronically ill patients.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — clinical stages and manifestations: The clinical presentation of vitamin D–deficiency rickets includes symptoms and signs of bone deformity and/or pain and may be associated with hypocalcemia and associated clinical features. The disease can be divided into 3 stages; the first stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical or overt hypocalcemia, followed in the second stage by rising PTH levels, and in the final stage bone changes become more severe with hypocalcemia again evident. Symptoms range from none to irritability, delay in gross motor development, and bone pain, and signs include widening of the wrists and ankles, genu varum or valgum, prominence of the costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), delayed closure of fontanelles, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Vitamin D deficiency presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or tetany is reported more frequently in infancy and adolescence than in childhood; hypocalcemic children may have apneic spells, stridor or wheezing, hypotonia, muscular weakness, and brisk reflexes, and severe deficiency may be associated with cardiomyopathy related to hypocalcemia that normalizes with treatment.

Background

As the population ages, the healthcare needs of older adults have become an increasingly important focus. Older individuals often present with atypical or nonspecific symptoms when experiencing common health issues, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. This is particularly true in older adults living in nursing homes, where frailty, comorbidities, and cognitive decline are prevalent. Nonspecific symptoms, such as confusion or fatigue, may obscure the underlying cause of illness, leading to potential misdiagnosis.

Furthermore, the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance has prompted a critical review of how antibiotics are used, particularly in the care of older adults in nursing homes. As such, there is a growing need to understand and explore other potential explanations for these nonspecific symptoms in this vulnerable population.

Confusion, restlessness, and fatigue are common nonspecific symptoms among older adults living in nursing homes and, in the absence of new symptoms from the urinary tract, often misinterpreted as urinary tract infections (UTIs), leading to unnecessary antibiotic treatment. This practice increases the risk of selecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. UTIs are more prevalent among women in nursing homes. According to international consensus, even in older residents in nursing homes, symptoms from the lower urinary tract should be present to diagnose acute cystitis. Despite this, few patients treated for suspected UTIs in nursing homes actually exhibit lower urinary tract symptoms. The diagnosis is instead based on nonspecific symptoms, which are not specific to the urinary tract, such as confusion, restlessness, fatigue, agitation, reduced appetite, tendency to fall, or a sense of not being oneself. Given the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria it is important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Therefore, it is important to investigate alternative explanations for these nonspecific symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency is common among older adults living in nursing homes and is associated with risk of falls. It has also been linked to impaired cognitive functions and dementia. Impaired cognitive function can manifest as nonspecific symptoms, highlighting the importance of investigating whether there is an association between these symptoms, often misinterpreted as UTIs, and vitamin D deficiency.

The aim of this study was to determine if nonspecific symptoms among older adults living in nursing homes are associated with vitamin D deficiency.
