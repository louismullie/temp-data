## Question

What is the appropriate adenosine dose for atrial fibrillation in a patient with WPW?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate adenosine dose for atrial fibrillation in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether adenosine is indicated or contraindicated in pre-excited AF. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for AF with WPW. Next, I need to check the FDA labeling for adenosine and its approved dosing and indications. After that, I will consider mechanistic risks and any clinical evidence of harm. Finally, I should outline the correct acute management pathway and synthesize a clear bottom line answer with safety caveats [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o] [^115YjCUR] [^117D3YmF].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and pathophysiology. In AF with WPW, atrial impulses can conduct anterogradely via the accessory pathway, producing very rapid, irregular wide-complex ventricular rates that can exceed 250–300 bpm and may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation; the AV node's protective filtering is bypassed during pre-excited AF, which is precisely why maneuvers or drugs that slow AV nodal conduction can paradoxically worsen ventricular rates by shunting more impulses down the accessory pathway [^116DiEyD].

> Next, I should review high-credibility guideline recommendations; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I verify the exact wording. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline explicitly recommends avoiding AV-nodal–blocking agents in AF with anterograde accessory pathway conduction and lists adenosine among the agents to avoid; for stable patients it recommends IV procainamide or IV ibutilide for pharmacologic cardioversion, and for unstable patients immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o]. I should confirm there is alignment internationally; the 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guideline likewise advises avoiding AV nodal blockers and amiodarone in ventricular pre-excitation and endorses ibutilide or procainamide or electrical cardioversion depending on stability, which matches the ACC/AHA/HRS stance [^115YjCUR].

> I need to check the FDA label to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. The adenosine label indicates use for conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, including cases associated with accessory pathways, but it explicitly states adenosine does not convert atrial fibrillation and may only transiently slow ventricular response; the approved dosing sequence of 6 mg then 12 mg IV bolus applies to PSVT, not AF, and thus is not appropriate here; I should also recall the label's serious cardiovascular adverse events, including VF, underscoring the risk in the wrong rhythm substrate [^117D3YmF] [^111Nrk6i] [^115V8uTk] [^117GPB8J].

> I will now examine clinical evidence for proarrhythmia to avoid overstating theory; wait, let me verify a representative case. A published case describes degeneration into pre-excited AF following adenosine for a presumed narrow-complex tachycardia in WPW, requiring urgent cardioversion; emergency medicine reviews similarly warn that AV-nodal–blocking drugs can precipitate hemodynamic collapse in pre-excited AF, reinforcing the guideline prohibition of adenosine in this context [^112z7pXZ] [^116DiEyD].

> Let me consider correct management alternatives and double-check for any exceptions. For hemodynamically unstable pre-excited AF, immediate synchronized cardioversion is the treatment of choice; for stable patients, IV procainamide or IV ibutilide are recommended options that prolong the accessory pathway refractory period and can cardiovert, while all AV nodal blockers including adenosine, beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin, and even amiodarone should be avoided due to the potential to accelerate pre-excited conduction and provoke VF; I initially wondered whether amiodarone might be acceptable in structural heart disease, but current guidance places it on the avoid list for pre-excited AF because of reported acceleration of ventricular response and proarrhythmia in this setting [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o] [^115YjCUR] [^111qxFCc].

> Bottom line, I should confirm there is no safe dose here before I conclude; after rechecking the guidelines and label, there is no appropriate adenosine dose for AF with WPW, because adenosine is contraindicated in pre-excited AF at any dose and should not be administered; the PSVT dosing sequence of 6 mg then 12 mg is irrelevant and dangerous in this context, and management should instead follow the procainamide or ibutilide pathway for stable patients or immediate synchronized cardioversion if unstable [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o] [^117D3YmF].

---

Do not use **adenosine** for atrial fibrillation with WPW [^115hR2Ew] because it may precipitate dangerous ventricular acceleration or ventricular fibrillation [^112z7pXZ] [^117GPB8J]. Instead, use **IV procainamide or ibutilide** [^116hNf2o] for stable patients and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable [^115KoJg4]. Avoid **AV nodal blockers** — including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, amiodarone, and adenosine — in pre-excited AF [^115YjCUR] [^115hR2Ew].

---

## Clinical risks of adenosine in WPW-associated AF

Adenosine **blocks the AV node** [^115hR2Ew], which can shift conduction to the accessory pathway, producing rapid ventricular rates and potentially triggering ventricular fibrillation [^112z7pXZ]. This risk is greatest when the accessory pathway has a short refractory period, allowing very rapid conduction [^112Ga2h4].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines explicitly **advise against adenosine** [^115hR2Ew] in AF with pre-excitation [^115YjCUR] due to the risk of ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamic collapse. Recommended alternatives include **IV procainamide or ibutilide** for stable patients with pre-excited AF [^116hNf2o] [^115KoJg4] and **immediate synchronized cardioversion** for unstable patients [^116hNf2o].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management

For stable pre-excited AF, **use agents that slow conduction over the accessory pathway** [^116hNf2o].

| **Medication** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Procainamide | 15 mg/kg IV over 30–60 min | Monitor for hypotension and QRS widening |
| Ibutilide | - 1 mg IV over 10 min <br/> - Repeat once if needed | Monitor for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes |
| Flecainide | 2 mg/kg IV over 10 min (max 150 mg) | Avoid in structural heart disease |
| Propafenone | 2 mg/kg IV over 10 min (max 150 mg) | Avoid in structural heart disease |

---

## Clinical scenarios where adenosine may be considered

Adenosine may be used for diagnostic purposes in narrow-complex tachycardias [^117D3YmF] when AF is not suspected, but only with continuous ECG monitoring and immediate access to resuscitation equipment [^112z7pXZ] [^111dvrds]. It is **not indicated for AF with pre-excitation** [^115hR2Ew].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not use adenosine**: in AF with pre-excitation due to risk of ventricular fibrillation [^115YjCUR] [^115hR2Ew].
- **Use procainamide or ibutilide**: for stable pre-excited AF [^115KoJg4] [^116hNf2o].
- **Perform immediate cardioversion**: if the patient is unstable [^116hNf2o].

---

Adenosine is **contraindicated in AF with WPW** [^115hR2Ew] because it can precipitate ventricular fibrillation; use procainamide or ibutilide [^116hNf2o] for stable patients and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable [^115KoJg4].

Although serious adverse events following adenosine administration are rare, it should only be administered in an environment where continuous ECG monitoring and emergency resuscitation equipment are available. The case report describes the development of pre-excited atrial fibrillation in a 31-year-old woman with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome following the administration of adenosine. She had previously been fit and well and was admitted to the coronary care unit with a 2-hour history of regular palpitations. A 12-lead ECG showed a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. Carotid sinus massage was unsuccessful in terminating the tachycardia, and the patient subsequently received rapid boluses of intravenous adenosine. The cardiac rhythm degenerated into atrial fibrillation with ventricular pre-excitation following 12 mg adenosine.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with WPW and pre-excitation syndromes, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines advise administering IV ibutilide or IV procainamide for pharmacological cardioversion. This is recommended as an alternative to elective cardioversion in hemodynamically stable patients with AF with rapid anterograde conduction (pre-excited AF).

Regarding atrial fibrillation, especially concerning patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and pre-excitation syndromes, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of pharmacological agents that block atrioventricular nodal conduction. Such agents include verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, and β-blockers. These should not be used in patients with atrial fibrillation and anterograde accessory pathway conduction (pre-excited AF) due to the risk of precipitating ventricular fibrillation or causing hemodynamic deterioration.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111qxFCc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), also known as preexcited AF, typically present with a rapid ventricular response rate and wide QRS complexes. The fast conduction of atrial high‐frequency impulses occurs preferentially via the accessory pathway (AP), which has a shorter refractory period than the atrioventricular node (AVN). Consequently, patients are at a higher risk of hemodynamic instability, spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), and cardiac arrest.

Patients with preexcited AF who present with hemodynamic instability typically undergo prompt electrical cardioversion. Those with stable hemodynamics are commonly treated with the infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug to decrease the preexcited ventricular rate and prevent hemodynamic instability. The 2017 European Heart Rhythm Association Consensus recommends procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or ibutilide, whereas the 2014 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend procainamide or ibutilide for intravenous use to acutely slow the ventricular rate of preexcited AF.

The above four agents, however, are not recommended for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function (ILVF). Intravenous amiodarone, a multichannel blocker, was widely used in the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and ILVF. Recent reports of accelerated preexcited ventricular responses and VF during amiodarone infusion have raised concerns about its utility. Therefore, intravenous amiodarone is no longer considered effective within this context.

### Adenosine in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia: 5 years of experience (2002–2006) [^1114qKAo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We report a retrospective analysis over 5 years of adenosine use in our emergency department (2002–2006). We treated 454 patients with an intravenous bolus of adenosine. The cohort consisted of 40.7% men and 59.3% women, with a mean age of 47.32 years and a mean heart rate of 162.48 beats per minute. Among them, 73% responded immediately to the 6 mg dose, 15% responded after the second 12 mg dose, and 11% responded to a further 12 mg dose, whereas 11% were unresponsive. We observed minor side effects in a high percentage of patients, including chest tightness (83%), flushing (39.4%), and a sense of impending death (7%). Only one major adverse effect was recorded; administering 12 mg of adenosine induced a marked acceleration in the ventricular rate of a patient with an undiagnosed atrial flutter, caused by induction of atrioventricular conduction (1:1).

Our results confirm that when patients are appropriately selected, adenosine is probably the best available drug to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, especially in emergency situations.

Chest pain is not an uncommon complaint among adolescents; however, it often leads them to seek emergency medical care. The variant angina (coronary artery spasm) with resulting acute myocardial ischemia is an extremely rare cause of chest pain among the pediatric population, and there are very few cases reported. We describe a 13-year-old boy with underlying intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who had an acute coronary artery syndrome due to coronary artery vasospasm.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^113xDUCi]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). High credibility.

The procedure was performed through a median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass without cardioplegic arrest. The beating heart allowed real-time electrophysiologic testing during the procedure. An incision was made through the right ventricular epicardial fat a few millimeters lateral to the atrioventricular junction and over the right coronary artery (RCA). The epicardial fat was then dissected away from the RCA in an attempt to divide the accessory pathway, which resulted in no change in preexcitation.

The right atrium was then opened with a free wall incision, and the tricuspid valve was exposed. Sites of previous catheter ablation were clearly visible by endocardial scarring. An incision was made approximately 5 mm from the tricuspid annulus starting at the 1 o'clock position and carried down to the coronary sinus. The dissection was extended through the endocardium, exposing the RCA from the inside and carried into the pyramidal space. At this point of dissection into the pyramidal space, the preexcitation disappeared — consistent with the division of a subendocardial posterior-septal pathway.

Adenosine was then administered for atrioventricular nodal blockade, at which point we could not demonstrate antegrade or retrograde conduction across the accessory pathway. Further ablation was performed using radiofrequency and cryoablative techniques along the endocardial dissection plane.

### Adenosine [^117GPB8J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

The following adverse reactions were reported with intravenous adenosine used in controlled U.S. clinical trials. The placebo group experienced less than a 1% rate of all these reactions.

- **Post marketing experience**: The following adverse events have been reported from marketing experience with adenosine injection. Since these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and are associated with concomitant diseases, multiple drug therapies, and surgical procedures, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) the seriousness of the event, (2) the frequency of the reporting, (3) the strength of causal connection to the drug, or a combination of these factors.

- **Cardiovascular**: Prolonged asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, transient increase in blood pressure, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and Torsade de Pointes.

- **Respiratory**: Bronchospasm.

- **Central nervous system**: Seizure activity, including tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, and loss of consciousness.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^113hsdWr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The study examines the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in 51 patients with preexcitation. The parameter changes for each patient are depicted with lines having a dot at each end. Horizontal bars and vertical lines represent mean values and standard deviations (with median and percentiles 25–75 shown).

- **Electrophysiological and clinical parameters include**: atrial fibrillation; average preexcited R-R interval; average R-R interval; heart rate; percentage preexcitation, which is the ratio of preexcited complexes to total ventricular complexes; systolic blood pressure; and the shortest preexcited R-R interval.

- **Figure 3 highlights** characteristic responses of nifekalant in two patients with preexcitation.

	- **First patient**: A 47-year-old man with paroxysmal preexcitation and no structural heart disease. Before nifekalant infusion, his R-R interval was 283 ms with no narrow preexcitation observed in panel A. At 7 minutes post-infusion, his R-R interval prolonged to 329 ms with an intermittent narrow preexcitation shown in panel B. This patient underwent ablation of both accessory pathways.

	- **Second patient**: A 69-year-old woman with spontaneous sustained preexcitation who had rheumatic heart disease and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. Before nifekalant infusion, her R-R interval was 310 ms, and no narrow preexcitation was noted in panel C. At 7 minutes post-infusion, her R-R interval prolonged to 420 ms with intermittent narrow preexcitation depicted in panel D. This patient underwent ablation of only one accessory pathway.

Abbreviations: AF indicates atrial fibrillation; shortest preexcited R-R interval. Arrows in the images indicate the presence of a narrow preexcitation and no preexcitation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^1166bw2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation has not been assessed.

- **Methods and results**: The study populations consisted of patients with sustained preexcited atrial fibrillation (n = 51), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 201), and persistent atrial fibrillation (n = 87). Effects of intravenous infusion of nifekalant were assessed on electrophysiological and clinical parameters. Nifekalant prolonged the shortest preexcited R-R interval, the average preexcited R-R interval, and the average R-R intervals from 290 ± 35 to 333 ± 44 ms, 353 ± 49 to 443 ± 64 ms, and 356 ± 53 to 467 ± 75 ms, respectively, in patients with preexcited atrial fibrillation (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant also decreased the percentage of preexcited complexes, heart rate, and increased systolic pressure (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant terminated atrial fibrillation in 33 of 51 patients (65%). Similar effects were also observed in a subgroup of 12 patients with preexcited atrial fibrillation and impaired left ventricular function. In patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, nifekalant significantly prolonged the effective refractory period, the block cycle length of the antegrade accessory pathway, and the atrial effective refractory period (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant had no effect on the effective refractory period of the antegrade atrioventricular node. Finally, in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation without an accessory pathway, nifekalant did not significantly decrease the ventricular rate. One patient developed Torsades de Pointes. No other adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period of the antegrade accessory pathway and atrium without blocking the antegrade atrioventricular node.

### Impact of adenosine on wavefront propagation in persistent atrial fibrillation: Insights from global noncontact charge density mapping of the left atrium [^112zvDwB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In order to correct for false-positive pattern detection and isolated occurrences and to identify regions where specified activation patterns are repeatedly observed, a method of applying detection cutoffs was devised for left atrial activation (LRA) and left intra-atrial (LIA) assessments. A dynamic threshold, individualized for each recording, is required due to significant variation in frequency and duration of patterns across the chamber. This could lead to a fixed frequency threshold that is appropriate for one patient or map segment, either excluding all activation occurrences or not sufficiently excluding regions with low relative frequency when applied to another recording.

In addition, the relationship between frequency and duration of pattern occurrences is not fixed, meaning a threshold considering only a set percentage of pattern occurrences without including the duration these are present may be inadequate. First, a static map was generated with all pattern occurrences included, and the percentage of time the pattern was present anywhere in the chamber was calculated. Occurrences were then excluded using cutoff values according to the frequency of each pattern that represented a 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% relative drop in the total time the pattern was present. This resulted in gradually greater exclusion of regions with infrequent pattern occurrences, leaving those with the greatest frequency of detection (Figure 2).

Measuring the number of occurrences of each activation pattern, along with the proportion of time these patterns are present over the fixed map duration of 5 seconds, provides additional insights into the dynamics of wavefront propagation.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern by pediatric electrophysiologists [^114JrgTE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

To determine the present-day approach of pediatric cardiac electrophysiologists to asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern, a questionnaire was sent to 266 members of the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society across 25 countries. This study repeated 21 questions from a 2003 survey and added new questions regarding risk stratification and decision-making.

Out of 113 responses from 13 countries, respondents had substantial electrophysiology experience with a median of 15 years (IQR 8.5–25 years). Only 12 (11%) believed that intermittent pre-excitation and 37 (33%) that sudden loss of pre-excitation on exercise test were sufficient to deem an accessory pathway safe enough to avoid an invasive electrophysiology study.

The optimal weight for an electrophysiology study was reported as 20 kg (IQR 18–22.5 kg). Furthermore, 61% and 58% of respondents would proceed to ablate all right-sided or left-sided accessory pathways, respectively, irrespective of their electrophysiological properties; in contrast, only 23% would choose ablation for all septal accessory pathways (P < .001). Comparison with the 2003 survey indicated that respondents were more likely to consider inducible arrhythmia as sufficient justification for ablation (77% vs. 26%, P < .001).

In conclusion, in light of recent literature on the reliability of risk stratification tools, most operators now perform electrophysiology studies for asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients regardless of noninvasive findings, and many proceed to ablate all detected accessory pathways.

### Natural history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood [^113LPCkd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome carries a risk for symptomatic arrhythmias and sudden death. This study aimed to examine the natural history of patients with WPW syndrome diagnosed in childhood, followed longitudinally at a single institution. The study population consisted of 446 patients with a median age of diagnosis of 7 years; 61% were male. Associated heart disease was present in 40 patients (9%).

- **Modes of presentation**: Supraventricular tachycardia (38%), palpitations (22%), chest pain (5%), syncope (4%), atrial fibrillation (0.4%), sudden death (0.2%), and incidental findings (26%). Data were unavailable in 4%.

During the study period, a total of 243 patients (54%) had supraventricular tachycardia, and 7 patients (1.6%) had atrial fibrillation. In patients who presented at ≤ 3 months of age, 35% had resolution of manifest preexcitation, compared with 5.8% who presented at > 3 months of age (p < 0.0001). There were 6 sudden deaths (1.3%), with an incidence of 2.8 per 1,000 patient-years. Two of these patients had structurally normal hearts (incidence 1.1 per 1,000 patient-years). Four of these patients had associated heart disease (incidence 27 per 1,000 patient-years, p < 0.01).

In conclusion, in a large population of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood, 64% had symptoms at presentation, and an additional 20% developed symptoms during follow-up. There were 6 sudden deaths (1.3%), with an overall incidence of 1.1 per 1,000 patient-years in patients with structurally normal hearts and 27 per 1,000 patient-years in those with associated heart disease.

### Adenosine [^111Nrk6i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Dosage & administration**: Adenosine injection is for rapid bolus intravenous use only. It should be administered as a rapid bolus through the peripheral intravenous route to ensure the solution reaches the systemic circulation. This can be achieved by administering it directly into a vein or, if using an IV line, giving it as close to the patient as possible followed by a rapid saline flush.

- **Adult patients**: The dose recommendation is based on clinical studies using peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous administration (i.e. CVP or other) of adenosine has not been systematically studied. The recommended intravenous doses for adults are as follows: The initial dose is 6 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus over 1 to 2 seconds. If the first dose does not eliminate the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, a repeat dose of 12 mg should be administered, again as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if necessary.

- **Pediatric patients**: In neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, dosages equivalent to those for adults are used on a weight basis.

	- **Pediatric patients with a body weight < 50 kg**: The initial dose is 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg given as a rapid IV bolus, administered either centrally or peripherally, followed by a saline flush. If conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be given at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg, followed by a saline flush.

### Adenosine [^117D3YmF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Adenosine Injection, USP is indicated for the conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including cases associated with accessory bypass tracts such as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers, such as the Valsalva maneuver, should be attempted prior to administering adenosine. It is important to ensure that the adenosine solution reaches the systemic circulation.

Adenosine does not convert atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm. In cases of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, transient modest slowing of the ventricular response may occur immediately after adenosine administration.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^112x7AwZ]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

The patient is a 27-year-old man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and two prior unsuccessful catheter ablation attempts who presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully resuscitated, and after recovery, he was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20% with an electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and a delta wave (see Figure 1, A). Electrophysiology mapping indicated a posterior-septal accessory pathway. Multiple attempts to ablate the accessory pathway endocardially and via the middle cardiac vein were unsuccessful. One additional attempt at catheter ablation via both endocardial and epicardial mapping and ablation was also unsuccessful. In view of resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation due to rapid atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly over the accessory pathway, the patient was referred for surgical ablation.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AenWH]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. Previous studies have reported a decreased incidence in AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), indicating that the AP itself may play an important role in the initiation of AF. However, paroxysmal AF still frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. The identification of patients at high risk for recurrence of AF is of clinical importance because additional therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients.

Interatrial block (IAB) denotes a conduction delay between the right and left atria that manifests in a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms. A prolonged P-wave with biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads represents an even higher degree of IAB and has been referred to as advanced IAB. The appearance of advanced IAB is frequently associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias and has been found to predict AF in multiple clinical scenarios. However, the role of advanced IAB in predicting the recurrence of AF after AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome is unclear. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the clinical utility of advanced IAB for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116k1KWz]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control and maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of dofetilide for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, with close monitoring of the QT interval, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function in patients with AF without significant baseline QT interval prolongation or uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

### Adenosine [^111mLgM9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Adenosine plays a critical role in clinical pharmacology, particularly in the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). It slows conduction time through the A-V node, which can interrupt reentry pathways and restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with PSVT, including those associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. Methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, competitively antagonize adenosine, whereas nucleoside transport blockers such as dipyridamole potentiate its effects. Adenosine's action is not inhibited by atropine.

The hemodynamics of adenosine reveal that an intravenous bolus dose of 6 or 12 mg usually does not affect systemic hemodynamics. Larger doses administered by infusion can decrease blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance.

In terms of pharmacokinetics, intravenously administered adenosine is quickly cleared from circulation through cellular uptake by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. This uptake occurs via a specific transmembrane nucleoside carrier system, which is reversible and bidirectionally symmetrical. Intracellular adenosine is then rapidly metabolized — either phosphorylated to adenosine monophosphate by adenosine kinase or deaminated to inosine by adenosine deaminase in the cytosol. Adenosine kinase, with a lower Km and Vmax than adenosine deaminase, highlights that deamination becomes significant only when cytosolic adenosine saturates the phosphorylation pathway. Inosine, formed by adenosine deamination, can either exit the cell intact or be further degraded into hypoxanthine, xanthine, and ultimately uric acid.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern in young patients: Has anything changed [^115zVSLc]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The approach to pediatric asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) patients is controversial. The objective of this review is to update the last consensus of specialists from the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society/Heart Rhythm Society on this subject to summarize the most recent evidence on the management of young patients with asymptomatic WPW pattern. A systematic review of the literature published between 2008 and 2018 was performed, taking into account the protocol of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) in PubMed (including Cochrane), Embase, and Web of Science. Observational, experimental, and multicentric studies were included. Out of a total of 37 articles selected, 4 were considered eligible.

Most studies considered a cutoff age of 8 or greater as recommended in the 2012 consensus. The identification of a shortest pre-excitatory RR interval (SPERRI) ≤ 250 ms seems to be the best predictor for risk stratification. The importance of routine isoprenaline use to improve the sensitivity of the electrophysiological study to identify patients at high risk of sudden death was consensual. Prophylactic ablative therapy has been indicated in asymptomatic children with an accessory pathway (AP) who have a low SPERRI and/or a low effective anterograde period of the AP and/or multiple APs. Despite the evidence found in the most recent studies, more studies are warranted in this setting.

### Impact of adenosine on wavefront propagation in persistent atrial fibrillation: Insights from global noncontact charge density mapping of the left atrium [^112RHCf6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that rotational activation, in contrast with focal firing, and much less so local intra-atrial activation (LIA), is influenced by adenosine. Adenosine allows for a higher density of rotating wavefronts at spatially variable sites throughout the left atrium and a shorter global cycle length with an increase in dominant frequency (DF). The degree of rotational activation may serve as a surrogate measure of individual atrial functional properties, with little evidence that rotational activation seen with adenosine represents promising targets for ablation aimed at arrhythmogenic sources of atrial fibrillation (AF) perpetuation within the left atrium, particularly as there is little stability of local rotational activation (LRA) sites within patients. Caution should be exercised when interpreting maps obtained after adenosine administration to guide nonpulmonary vein ablation.

### Electrophysiologic profile and results of invasive risk stratification in asymptomatic children and adolescents with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern [^112rkvvL]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Data on the results and clinical effect of an invasive risk stratification strategy in asymptomatic young patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern are scarce.

- **Methods and results**: Eighty-five consecutive patients aged < 18 years with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and persistent preexcitation at maximum exercise undergoing invasive risk stratification were retrospectively studied. Adverse accessory pathway (AP) properties were defined according to currently consented criteria as any of the following: shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation/rapid atrial pacing ≤ 250 ms (or antegrade effective refractory period ≤ 250 ms if shortest preexcited RR interval was not available), or inducible atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. Age at evaluation was median 14.9 years. Eighty-two patients had a structurally normal heart and 3 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A single manifest AP was present in 80 patients, 1 manifest and 1 concealed AP in 4 patients, and 2 manifest APs in 1 patient. Adverse AP properties were present in 32 of 85 patients (37.6%) at baseline and in an additional 16 of 44 (36.4%) after isoproterenol. Ablation was performed in 41 of these 48 patients. Ablation was deferred in the remaining 7 for pathway proximity to the atrioventricular node. In addition, 18 of the low-risk patients were ablated based on patient/parental decision.

- **Conclusions**: Adverse AP properties at baseline were exhibited by 37.6% of the evaluated patients with an asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White preexcitation persisting at peak exercise.

### Atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: ECG recognition and treatment in the ED [^116DiEyD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a condition where atrial impulses bypass the atrioventricular node and directly activate the ventricular myocardium via an accessory pathway. Clinical clues for diagnosis include a young patient with previous episodes of palpitations, rapid heart rate, or syncope. Although several different rhythm presentations are possible, atrial fibrillation is a common dysrhythmia seen in WPW patients. Electrocardiographic features suggestive of WPW atrial fibrillation include irregularity of the rhythm, a very rapid ventricular response, presence of a delta wave, and a wide, bizarre QRS complex.

- **Management**: Stable patients suspected of having this condition should not receive agents that predominantly block atrioventricular conduction, but they may be treated with procainamide or ibutilide. If instability is present, electrical cardioversion is required.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AateQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman with no medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of sudden onset chest pressure, palpitations, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. She reported a 90-pound unintentional weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, night sweats, and palpitations for 2 months.

Physical examination revealed a heart rate (HR) of 269 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/94 mm Hg. Her ECG revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with right bundle branch morphology and an HR of 265 bpm. Intravenous adenosine was administered, resulting in the resolution of the arrhythmia and symptoms. Her subsequent ECG showed sinus tachycardia with δ waves, consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.

Laboratory findings confirmed thyroid storm, and treatment began with intravenous hydrocortisone, methimazole, metoprolol, amiodarone, and iodine drops. Graves' disease was confirmed based on the presence of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. The patient underwent successful WPW accessory tract ablation 6 weeks after the initial presentation.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115YJHzp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) can eliminate atrial fibrillation (AF) in some patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, it can recur in others. The hypothesis that adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation might effectively prevent AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is still under investigation.

A retrospective study was conducted with 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation. Of these, 103 (64.4%) underwent only AP ablation (AP group), while 57 (35.6%) underwent AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). An advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

During a mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range 3–36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) experienced AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not significantly differ between the AP + PVI group and the AP group (15.5% vs. 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–1.68; p = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was notably lower in the AP + PVI group compared to the AP group (90% vs. 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.032).

In conclusion, PVI following successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening using a resting 12-lead ECG is recommended for better management of these patients.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114xYpjb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The study examined the electrophysiological effects of nifekalant in patients who have Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation. The primary objective was to assess the clinical efficacy of nifekalant in managing these conditions. The findings indicated a significant reduction in arrhythmia episodes following nifekalant administration.

- **Study design**: The research adopted a randomized controlled trial methodology involving a sample size sufficient to provide credible results.
- **Participant details**: Participants with diagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and concurrent atrial fibrillation were recruited for the study.
- **Outcome measures**: Key measures included the frequency of arrhythmic events and electrophysiological parameters recorded during the study period.
- **Results**: Nifekalant demonstrated effectiveness in reducing arrhythmia prevalence in the target patient group, with improvements in measured electrophysiological parameters.

In conclusion, the administration of nifekalant was associated with beneficial outcomes for patients with both Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation, presenting a potential therapeutic option worthy of further investigation.

### Occurrence of intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during intravenous sedation [^1136LByR]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, defined as intermittent loss of the delta waves, can show occasional conduction through the accessory pathway. WPW syndrome often causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. However, it may be difficult to identify the abnormalities preoperatively because of their only intermittent occurrence. We report a case in which exogenously administered epinephrine and an autonomic imbalance may have precipitated the abrupt occurrence and disappearance of the delta waves.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1167RxQw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with overt or intermittent WPW syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed.

The inclusion criteria were:

- At least one documented episode of AF before ablation
- Performance of AP ablation alone, with no catheter ablation for AF
- Successful catheter ablation, defined as the elimination of Kent bundle conduction by demonstration of atrial and ventricular pacing even after isoproterenol infusion
- Available records of a post‐ablation, 12‐lead ECG

The exclusion criteria were:

- Repeated ablations
- Previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease
- Thyroid dysfunction on admission (abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid‐stimulating hormone level)

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed about the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent has been waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

- **Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation**: The patients underwent an electrophysiological study after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half‐lives and before radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1133ACDD]. Heart Rhythm (2017). High credibility.

The first study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial involving 534 patients with PAF. All the patients were administered adenosine 20 minutes following initial PVI. The initial dose was 12 mg, which was titrated until at least one blocked P wave or a 3-second pause was observed. The presence of dormant PV conduction was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence. Patients with dormant PV conduction were randomly assigned to additional adenosine-guided or to no further ablation. Elimination of dormant PV conduction by additional targeted ablation significantly reduced re-atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs) by 56% during follow-up (P < 0.0001).

The most recent study enrolled 2113 patients with paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent AF. In this study, 0.4 mg per kg of adenosine was administered following a variable waiting time (median time 43 minutes). Early reconduction after the waiting time alone was observed in 42% of the patients in both groups. Subsequent administration of adenosine demonstrated further reconduction in an additional 27% of the patients. Further ablation was then performed to eliminate dormant conduction. At the end of 1 year of follow-up, no difference in outcome was observed, with a success rate of approximately 65% in each group. Of note, given the lower observed 27.6% prevalence of dormant conduction in the latter trial, a risk reduction of 72.4% in those patients with dormant conduction would have been required to detect a significant overall difference. It is also notable that the use of force-sensing ablation catheter was employed.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116jXM56]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances concerning atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with valvular heart disease, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating long-term anticoagulation with warfarin over direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). This recommendation aims to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke or death, in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) or MS of moderate or greater severity and a history of atrial fibrillation, independent of the CHA2DS2-VASc score.

### Malignant vasovagal syndrome in two patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^117Uv3Wk]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in patients presenting with syncope suggests that tachyarrhythmia may be the cause. However, the symptoms require careful evaluation. Two young patients presented with syncope and were found to have WPW syndrome on their ECG. In both patients, symptoms were suggestive of vasovagal syncope. During tilt testing, both patients developed their typical symptoms with a fall in blood pressure and heart rate, confirming the diagnosis of malignant vasovagal syndrome.

### Differentiating fasciculoventricular pathway from Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by electrocardiography [^116iHzEN]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

In school-based cardiovascular screening programs in Japan, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is diagnosed based on the presence of an electrocardiographic (ECG) delta wave without differentiation from the fasciculoventricular pathway (FVP), although the risk of sudden death is associated only with the former.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to differentiate FVP patients among children diagnosed with WPW syndrome by ECG.

- **Methods**: Children who were diagnosed with WPW syndrome through school screening between April 2006 and March 2008 and had QRS width ≤ 120 ms were included. Patients with asthma and/or coronary heart disease were excluded. FVP and WPW syndrome were differentiated based on ECG responses to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) injection. Age, PR interval, QRS width, and Rosenbaum classification were compared among patients.

- **Results**: Thirty patients (median age 12.7 years, range 6.5–15.7 years) participated in the study. FVP was diagnosed in 23 patients (76.7%), and WPW syndrome in 7 (23.3%). In Rosenbaum type A patients, all six patients had WPW syndrome, whereas FVP was diagnosed in 23 of 24, and WPW syndrome was diagnosed in 1 of 24, of type B patients. Age, PR interval, and QRS width were not significantly different between the two conditions.

- **Conclusion**: ATP stress test was reliable in differentiating FVP from WPW syndrome. Although FVP is considered rare, the results of our study indicate that many WPW syndrome patients with QRS width ≤ 120 ms may actually have FVP. Patients categorized as type B are more likely to have FVP, whereas type A patients tend to have WPW syndrome.

### Adenosine [^114gBxVq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Intravenous adenosine has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine (see WARNINGS). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see WARNINGS).

	- The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole. Thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**: Studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of adenosine. Adenosine was negative for genotoxic potential in the Salmonella (Ames Test) and Mammalian Microsome Assay.

### Cardiovascular disease in the young council's science and clinical education lifelong learning committee: Year in review [^113bovY4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, existing knowledge of Wolf‐Parkinson‐White and Brugada syndromes has been challenged, provoking new thoughts about paradigms for treatment and management. This year, three articles have advanced our understanding of these conditions.

- **Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome**: Practice guidelines for managing Wolf‐Parkinson‐White in children are largely based on the assumption that the risk of sudden death is both predictable and ascertainable. A large retrospective multicenter international study of 912 children with Wolf‐Parkinson‐White suggested that, while the risk of sudden death in children remains low, identifying those at highest risk remains difficult. These findings raise questions about future management recommendations and will likely affect how physicians counsel patients in the future.

- **Brugada syndrome**: Brugada syndrome has classically been considered a primary ion channel disorder. Although small case studies had previously suggested ablation as a curative therapy, multiple studies this year provide further evidence that epicardial ablation may successfully treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome in symptomatic adults. While long‐term follow‐up following ablation is lacking and studies in children have not been performed, these preliminary results provide new insights into this disease. Regardless of whether ablation is found to be a treatment option for children with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, the manner in which we approach this disease and counsel patients regarding long-term care may evolve.

### Risk of malignant arrhythmias in initially symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results of a prospective long-term electrophysiological follow-up study [^112Ga2h4]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

The available amount of detailed long-term data in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is limited, and no prospective electrophysiological studies looking at predictors of malignant arrhythmia are available.

- **Methods and results**: Among 8575 symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia referred for electrophysiological test, 369 (mean age, 23 ± 12.5 years) declined catheter ablation and were followed up. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate over a 5-year follow-up the predictors and characteristics of patients who develop malignant arrhythmias. After a mean follow-up of 42.1 ± 10 months, malignant arrhythmias developed in 29 patients (mean age, 13.9 ± 5.6 years; 26 male), resulting in presyncope/syncope (25 patients), hemodynamic collapse (3 patients), or cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation (1 patient).

Of the remaining 340 patients, 168 (mean age, 34.2 ± 9.0 years) remained asymptomatic up to 5 years, and 172 (mean age, 13.6 ± 5.1 years) had benign recurrence, including sustained atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (132 patients) or atrial fibrillation (40 patients). Compared with the group with no malignant arrhythmias, the group with malignant arrhythmias showed shorter accessory-pathway effective refractory period (P < 0.001) and more often exhibited multiple accessory pathways (P < 0.001), and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia triggering sustained pre-excited atrial fibrillation was more frequently inducible (P < 0.001).

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114YrSMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide, recommended by the guideline or consensus, on preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) have been reported by several investigators. Sellers et al. evaluated procainamide in 21 patients with preexcited AF. Boahene et al. evaluated procainamide in 30 patients and propafenone in 25 patients. Ludmer et al. evaluated propafenone in 10 patients, O'Nunain et al. evaluated propafenone and flecainide in 16 patients, and Glatter et al. evaluated ibutilide in 14 patients. All showed the effectiveness of the four agents in preexcited AF, albeit with different magnitudes of efficacy.

For example, Boahene et al. showed that propafenone prolonged SPRR from 215 ± 40 to 415 ± 198 ms, with a ΔSPRR of 200 ms. Ludmer et al. showed a propafenone ΔSPRR of 75 ms, whereas O'Nunain et al. showed a propafenone ΔSPRR of 37 ms, which indicated considerable heterogeneity among the studies. Factors contributing to the heterogeneity might include drug dose, infusion speed and time, intrinsic ERP of antegrade AP, hemodynamic status, sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, among others. This heterogeneity was more evident in the small sample size studies. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of nifekalant and other agents in the treatment of preexcited AF. Randomized controlled studies with large samples would be valuable to determine the comparative effectiveness of these agents.

One notable difference is that propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide could completely block the AP, whereas nifekalant did not completely block AP in the present study.

### A randomized study of prophylactic catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Wdapq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). High credibility.

Young age and inducibility of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during invasive electrophysiological testing identify asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern on the electrocardiogram as being at high risk for arrhythmic events. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of accessory pathways would provide meaningful and durable benefits as compared with no treatment in such patients.

- **Methods**: From 1997 to 2002, among 224 eligible asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, patients at high risk for arrhythmias were randomly assigned to radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways (37 patients) or no treatment (35 patients). The end point was the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: Patients assigned to ablation had baseline characteristics similar to those of the controls. Two patients in the ablation group (5 percent) and 21 in the control group (60 percent) had arrhythmic events. One control patient had ventricular fibrillation as the presenting arrhythmia. The five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of arrhythmic events were 7 percent among patients who underwent ablation and 77 percent among the controls (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test); the risk reduction with ablation was 92 percent (relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.33; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic accessory-pathway ablation markedly reduces the frequency of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114YuL7V]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically in relation to rhythm control and pharmacological cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the "pill-in-the-pocket" approach. This involves a single oral dose of flecainide or propafenone, paired with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent, for pharmacological cardioversion if previously tested in a monitored setting in patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation occurring outside the hospital.

### Adenosine [^115V8uTk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

In controlled studies conducted in the United States, bolus doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg were examined. A cumulative 60% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute after receiving an intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg adenosine (some patients converted on 3 mg, and those who did not were administered 6 mg). A cumulative 92% converted following a bolus dose of 12 mg. In contrast, 7% to 16% of patients converted after 1 to 4 placebo bolus injections. Similar responses were observed across a variety of patient subsets, including those using or not using digoxin, those with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, as well as among males, females, Blacks, Caucasians, and Hispanics.

Adenosine is not effective in converting other rhythms, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia, to normal sinus rhythm.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114t35rU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. Although previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), paroxysmal AF frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. Our recent study found that the presence of advanced interatrial block (IAB) and age greater than 50 years were associated with a higher risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation in WPW patients. For patients at high risk of AF recurrence, additional preventive interventions are required. Currently, pulmonary vein intervention (PVI) is a widely accepted treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal AF.

However, it is unknown whether additional PVI after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome, especially in patients at high risk of AF recurrence. Thus, the purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence in all patients with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF, and in patients at high risk of AF recurrence, identified by advanced IAB or age greater than 50 years.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^116Yo8MW]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Because patients with advanced interatrial block (IAB) have a high risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after accessory pathway (AP) ablation, additional interventions are required to prevent AF recurrence in this population. Pulmonary vein isolation is an established effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. However, we did not assess whether pulmonary vein isolation was effective for preventing AF recurrence in patients in the present study. Although the pulmonary vein is reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, atrial substrate abnormalities partially determine the likelihood of AF recurrence after AP ablation in these patients. Thus, the clinical efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation for preventing AF recurrence in these patients requires further study.

### Atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome but without paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^116h1rSy]. Clinical Cardiology (2004).

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The purpose of this study was to analyze the atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities and the vulnerability to develop atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with WPW syndrome but with no previous history of PAF.

- **Methods**: We investigated atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities and vulnerability to AF in patients with WPW syndrome but without PAF. An electrophysiologic study was performed in 28 patients with WPW syndrome, 23 with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and 25 with other arrhythmias (control), all of whom had no history of PAF. The following atrial excitability parameters were assessed: effective refractory period (ERP), spontaneous or paced (A1) and extrastimulated (A2) atrial electrogram widths, percent maximum atrial fragmentation (%MAF; A2/A1 x 100), wavelength index (WLI; ERP/A2), and inducibility of AF.

- **Results**: The ERP tended to be shorter in patients with WPW syndrome and in those with AVNRT than in the control group. The %MAF increased (154 ± 33 vs. 137 ± 23%, p < 0.05) and WLI decreased (2.7 ± 0.8 vs. 3.4 ± 1.0, p < 0.05) significantly in patients with WPW syndrome compared with the control group. However, these parameters in patients with AVNRT showed intermediate values. Atrial fibrillation was more inducible in patients with WPW syndrome (4/28 [14.3%]) than in those with AVNRT (1/23 [4.3%]) and the control group (0/25 [0%]).

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114tFe24]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

**Limitations**: Several limitations of our study should be considered. First, the small sample size may have introduced statistical bias; further studies involving larger numbers of patients are needed to evaluate the effects of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after accessory pathway (AP) ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Second, it is not possible to identify advanced interatrial block (IAB) before AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome because the delta wave overshadows the point at which the P-wave ends. Additionally, the P-wave duration was measured based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained immediately after the ablation procedure; thus, residual atrial injury from the ablation procedure may have affected the P-wave duration. Finally, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by the single-center, retrospective, observational approach.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111m6W3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with AF and no AP

Electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but no accessory pathway (AP) were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 38% (33 of 87) of patients, while 62% (54 of 87) continued to have AF after 30 minutes of nifekalant treatment. Among those whose AF did not terminate, the mean age was 58 ± 13 years (range 18–74 years), and 32 were male. Additionally, 37% (20 of 54) of these patients had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction of 37 ± 5%.

Ventricular rate changes during nifekalant infusion were as follows:

- **Baseline**: 97 ± 17 beats/min
- **During infusion**:
	- **After 1 minute**: 97 ± 16 beats/min
	- **After 3 minutes**: 99 ± 18 beats/min
	- **After 5 minutes**: 101 ± 20 beats/min
	- **After 7 minutes**: 103 ± 22 beats/min
	- **After 10 minutes**: 104 ± 24 beats/min
	- **After 15 minutes**: 102 ± 21 beats/min
	- **After 20 minutes**: 96 ± 19 beats/min
	- **After 30 minutes**: 95 ± 15 beats/min

Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (from 97 ± 17 to 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). There was a trend toward an increased ventricular rate at 0 to 10 minutes infusions, and a trend toward a decrease at 10 to 30 minutes of the infusion period.

The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with AF but no AP did not change significantly with nifekalant infusion (from 106 ± 16 to 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30). No torsades de pointes (TdP) occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^112Tj9wj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials, in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, upstream EPS and/or ablation) versus the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### Adenosine test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope: Marker of conducting tissue disease or neurally mediated syncope [^116WNCJX]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The adenosine test, which involves supine administration of a 20 mg intravenous bolus with electrocardiographic and blood pressure monitoring, has been endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on syncope management as an 'experimental' test in the diagnosis of unexplained syncope. The test is quick and cost-effective; however, there remains no consensus on the specific condition the adenosine test may reveal. Conducting tissue disease and neurally mediated syncope have been proposed by various authors as potential explanations. This article reviews the possible mechanisms underlying a positive adenosine test, evaluates its safety, and offers a comprehensive examination of the literature supporting each of the proposed causal diagnoses.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^112Mng4W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

All patients undergoing electrophysiological stimulation for the induction of atrial fibrillation (AF) were under the same anesthetic regimen as those who presented with spontaneous sustained preexcited AF. Both groups received local anesthesia at the puncture sites before the procedure. No additional anesthesia was used during the electrophysiological (EP) studies and drug infusion. Of the 51 patients, 12 (24%) had structural heart disease and a low mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 36 ± 6%.

- **EP studies**: These were performed using the WorkMate Claris System (St. Jude Medical Inc, Little Canada, MN). Surface ECG and bipolar intracardiac electrograms were simultaneously recorded from the high right atrium, coronary sinus, His bundle region, right ventricular apex, and left atrium (where appropriate). AF was induced routinely by rapid atrial decremental pacing, with cycle lengths ranging from 200 to 50 ms and a pulse width of 2 ms.

- **Adrenergic drugs**: Isoproterenol and other adrenergic drugs were not used during the EP studies, including the induction of AF, to avoid potential confounding effects of adrenergic stimulation on the shortest preexcited R-R (SPRR) interval and other electrical parameters.

AF was considered sustained if it lasted more than 10 minutes. Nifekalant infusion commenced following 10 minutes of successful AF induction, starting with an initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg over 5 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion at 10 μg/kg per minute for 25 minutes. The infusion was discontinued when AF terminated during the study.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115wfJJ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The entire process of electrophysiological studies in preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) was recorded and analyzed. Consecutive R-R intervals for 1 minute were measured before and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from the onset of infusion. Additionally, the R-R interval was recorded and analyzed 1 minute before the termination of AF. The electrophysiological parameters included the shortest preexcited R-R interval (SPRR), average preexcited R-R interval (APRR), average R-R interval (ARR), and the ratio of preexcited QRS complexes to total ventricular complexes, known as percentage preexcitation (PP). Clinical outcomes examined were heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP).

The electrophysiological parameters and clinical outcomes were compared during AF at baseline before the drug infusion (baseline state) and after nifekalant infusion, at infusion times of 7–10 minutes, or 1 minute before termination of AF if cardioversion occurred before 7 minutes. The study also investigated AF cardioversion, acceleration of preexcited ventricular responses, deterioration to syncope/cardiac arrest, and Torsades de Pointes (TdP).

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112dUWEh]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of sotalol for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, with close monitoring of the QT interval, heart rate, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function. This is advised for patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have significant baseline QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115gQTAx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS‐551 in Japan, is a pure class 3 antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed‐rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β‐adrenergic activity. Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, and decreases the defibrillation threshold.

Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with ILVF. Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. More recently, nifekalant has been used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter. However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114LU8ym]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been assessed. The study populations consisted of patients with sustained preexcited AF (n = 51), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 201), and persistent AF (n = 87). Effects of intravenous infusion of nifekalant were assessed on electrophysiological and clinical parameters. Nifekalant prolonged the shortest preexcited R-R, the average preexcited R-R, and the average R-R intervals from 290 ± 35 to 333 ± 44 ms, 353 ± 49 to 443 ± 64 ms, and 356 ± 53 to 467 ± 75 ms, respectively, in patients with preexcited AF (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant also decreased the percentage of preexcited QRS complexes, heart rate, and increased systolic pressure (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant terminated AF in 33 of 51 patients (65%). Similar effects were also observed in a subgroup of 12 patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function. In patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, nifekalant significantly prolonged the effective refractory period, the block cycle length of the antegrade accessory pathway, and the atrial effective refractory period (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant had no effect on the effective refractory period of the antegrade atrioventricular node. Finally, in patients with persistent AF without an accessory pathway, nifekalant did not significantly decrease the ventricular rate of AF. One patient developed Torsades de Pointes. No other adverse effects were observed.

In conclusion, nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period of the antegrade accessory pathway and may have therapeutic benefits for specific patient populations.

### Determining the optimal dose of adenosine for unmasking dormant pulmonary vein conduction following atrial fibrillation ablation: Electrophysiological and hemodynamic assessment. DORMANT-AF study [^117SNqkg]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

The significance of adenosine-induced dormant pulmonary vein (PV) conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation remains controversial. The optimal dose of adenosine to determine dormant PV conduction is yet to be systematically explored.

- **Methods and results**: Consecutive patients undergoing index AF ablation received three adenosine doses (12, 18, and 24 mg) in a randomized, blinded order, immediately after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Electrophysiological parameters (PR prolongation, AV block (AVB), and PV reconnection) and hemodynamic parameters (BP) were measured. A total of 339 doses (113 per dose) assessed 191 PVs in 50 patients (66% male, 72% paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 52% hypertensive). Dormant PV conduction occurred in 28% of patients (16.5% [32] of PVs). All cases were associated with AVB (AVB: PV reconnection vs. no PV reconnection 100% vs. 83%, P = 0.007). AVB occurred more frequently at 24 mg versus 12 mg (92% vs. 82%, P = 0.019) but not versus 18 mg (91%, P = 0.62). AVB duration increased between 12 mg (12.0 ± 8.9 seconds), 18 mg (16.1 ± 9.1 seconds, P = 0.001), and 24 mg (19.0 ± 9.3 seconds, P = 0.001). A decreased BP response to adenosine in patients weighing > 110 kg (65% vs. 91% in 70–110 kg group, P < 0.001) was observed.

### Atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction in undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1126rGuj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction via an accessory pathway is an uncommon presentation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome not previously reported in the emergency medicine literature. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a form of ventricular preexcitation sometimes initially seen and diagnosed in the emergency department (ED), can present with varied tachydysrhythmias for which certain treatments are contraindicated. For instance, atrial fibrillation with preexcited conduction needs specific consideration of medication choice to avoid potential degeneration into ventricular fibrillation.

- **Case report**: We describe an adult female presenting with a very rapid, regular wide complex tachycardia successfully cardioverted in the ED, followed by a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). An electrophysiology study confirmed atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction and revealed an accessory pathway consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, despite the lack of ECG findings of preexcitation during sinus rhythm. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Ventricular tachycardia must be the first consideration in patients with regular wide complex tachycardia. However, clinicians should consider atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction related to an accessory pathway when treating patients with the triad of a very rapid rate (> 250 beats/min), wide QRS complex, and regular rhythm, especially when considering pharmacologic treatment. Emergency physicians also should be aware of electrocardiographically concealed accessory pathways and that the lack of delta waves does not rule out the presence of an accessory pathway.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^111fi1R9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, it can recur in others.

We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation. This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, which was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2–71 months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF. P 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; p = 0.027) were identified as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

In conclusion, advanced IAB was found to be an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^115qm9SR]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

Dissection of the RCA into the pyramidal space exposes the site of the accessory pathway. This article describes, in detail, the techniques for surgical ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Surgery is now rarely performed for this indication but may be necessary in refractory cases.

First performed by Sealy in 1968, surgical ablation of an accessory pathway was the gold standard for curative treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). However, in the early 1990s, the safety and efficacy of catheter radiofrequency ablation replaced the surgical procedure. In most patients, catheter ablation will provide a cure for WPW; however, in select, refractory cases, there is still a role for surgical intervention. Here, we present a case and the technical details for the surgical correction of WPW. Consent was obtained from the patient to publish the images and the data (IRB approval No. HM13607; July 29, 2013).

Generally, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome presents a good prognosis. However, several case reports have demonstrated malignant arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death as WPW syndrome's first presentation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation using extracorporeal life support is a therapeutic option in refractory cardiac arrest. We present a WPW syndrome patient who experienced sudden cardiac arrest as the first presentation of the disease and was treated with extracorporeal life support, resulting in a good neurologic outcome.

### Adenosine versus intravenous calcium channel antagonists for supraventricular tachycardia [^111dvrds]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

People with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) frequently are symptomatic and present to the emergency department for treatment. Although vagal manoeuvres may terminate SVT, they often fail, and subsequently, adenosine or calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) are administered. Both are known to be effective, but both have a significant side effect profile. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the effects of adenosine versus CCAs in terminating SVT.

- **Search methods**: We identified studies by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers in July 2017. We checked bibliographies of identified studies and applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We planned to include all RCTs that compare adenosine versus a CCA for patients of any age presenting with SVT.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently checked results of searches to identify relevant studies and resolved differences by discussion with a third review author. At least two review authors independently assessed each included study and extracted study data. We entered extracted data into Review Manager 5. Primary outcomes were the rate of reversion to sinus rhythm and major adverse effects of adenosine and CCAs. Secondary outcomes were the rate of recurrence, time to reversion, and minor adverse outcomes. We measured outcomes by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and assessed the quality of primary outcomes using appropriate measures.
