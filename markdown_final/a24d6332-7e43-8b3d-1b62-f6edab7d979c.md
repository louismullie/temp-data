## Question

Middle-aged man with nonpruritic, sun-exacerbated blistering lesions on the hands, forearms, and face, dark urine, and a family history of similar skin findings.

A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a painless blistering rash on his hands, forearms, and face for 2 weeks. The rash is not itchy and seems to get worse in the sunlight. He has also noticed that his urine is darker than usual. His aunt and sister have a history of similar skin lesions. Examination of the skin shows multiple fluid-filled blisters and oozing erosions on the forearms, dorsal side of both hands, and forehead. There are areas of hyperpigmented scarring and patches of bald skin along the sides of the blisters. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat this patient's condition?

Answer Choices:
A. Hemin
B. Prednisone
C. Fexofenadine
D. Hydroxychloroquine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacotherapy is most appropriate for a 56-year-old man with nonpruritic, sun-exacerbated blistering on the hands, forearms, and face, dark urine, a family history of similar lesions, and scarring with milia, and to choose among hemin, prednisone, fexofenadine, or hydroxychloroquine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this fits porphyria cutanea tarda. Then, I should verify the key differentials that mimic PCT and how to exclude them. Next, I will review evidence-based treatments for PCT and compare their efficacy and safety. Finally, I will match the best option to the patient's phenotype and justify why the alternatives are incorrect or less appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. The combination of painless, nonpruritic bullae on sun-exposed sites, skin fragility, milia, scarring, hyperpigmentation, dark urine suggesting porphyrinuria, and a positive family history strongly supports porphyria cutanea tarda, particularly the familial type II form, which is autosomal dominant with low penetrance and often requires hepatic UROD activity below about 20% plus environmental triggers to manifest clinically [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7] [^3d820d47].

> Wait, let me verify the differentials I need to exclude. Pseudoporphyria can look identical clinically and histologically but lacks biochemical porphyrin elevation; it is often drug-induced or associated with dialysis, so I should confirm porphyrin studies before committing to PCT-specific therapy, even though the family history here makes PCT more likely [^1f91e2da] [^064a30ff]. Variegate porphyria can also cause photosensitive blistering, but it is classically associated with neurovisceral attacks and a different porphyrin pattern; I should keep that in mind if there are systemic symptoms or if the biochemical profile is atypical for PCT [^a72d2df7]. Bullous pemphigoid tends to be pruritic, shows linear IgG/C3 on direct immunofluorescence, and lacks dark urine, so it does not fit this presentation [^81a0c938].

> I will now examine first-line therapies for PCT. The two evidence-based, equally effective options are repeated phlebotomy to reduce hepatic iron and low-dose hydroxychloroquine to increase porphyrin excretion; both achieve biochemical and clinical remission in most patients, with remission typically in 6–15 months, though relapse can occur if susceptibility factors persist [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7] [^3d820d47]. Hold on, I should verify dosing: contemporary data support hydroxychloroquine 100 mg twice weekly, not daily, to balance efficacy and ocular safety, and this regimen has been used successfully in case series and reports, including in patients with familial PCT and those declining phlebotomy [^236577f9] [^1c7bec5a].

> Let me consider the provided options against this evidence. Hemin is used for acute hepatic porphyrias to repress hepatic ALA synthase and prevent neurovisceral attacks; it is not indicated for the chronic cutaneous porphyria of PCT, so choosing hemin would be a mismatch for this phenotype [^a72d2df7] [^501b71bd]. Prednisone and other systemic corticosteroids are not effective for PCT and are not recommended; steroids may help inflammatory blistering diseases like bullous pemphigoid, but that is not the diagnosis here, so prednisone would be inappropriate [^236577f9]. Fexofenadine is an antihistamine useful for pruritic conditions; PCT lesions are typically nonpruritic, so antihistamines do not address the pathophysiology and would not be expected to help.

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate or declines phlebotomy? In that scenario, low-dose hydroxychloroquine is a reasonable alternative that achieves remission in many patients, albeit with a possibly higher relapse risk than phlebotomy in observational data; I should counsel on ophthalmologic monitoring and use the lowest effective dose to mitigate retinal risk [^236577f9] [^1c7bec5a]. Given the choices provided and the clinical context, hydroxychloroquine is the only pharmacologic option listed that is evidence-based for PCT, making it the best answer among the alternatives presented [^236577f9].

> Final answer: D. Hydroxychloroquine, at 100 mg twice weekly, is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient with familial porphyria cutanea tarda, with the caveat that phlebotomy remains an equally effective first-line option and that porphyrin studies should confirm the diagnosis before initiating therapy [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)** [^236577f9], given the nonpruritic, sun-exposed bullae, dark urine, and family history. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **low-dose hydroxychloroquine** [^236577f9] (100–200 mg twice weekly), which mobilizes porphyrins and improves skin lesions. Prednisone is ineffective for PCT [^notfound], and hemin is reserved for acute porphyrias, not chronic cutaneous disease [^a72d2df7]. Fexofenadine is not indicated for PCT [^notfound].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis

The clinical features — nonpruritic bullae on sun-exposed sites, skin fragility, milia, hyperpigmentation, scarring, dark urine, and a positive family history — are classic for **PCT** [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7]. Key differentials include:

- **Pseudoporphyria**: clinically similar but normal porphyrins; often drug-induced (e.g. NSAIDs, diuretics) [^1f91e2da] [^064a30ff].
- **Variegate porphyria**: photosensitivity plus neurovisceral attacks; different porphyrin profile [^a72d2df7].
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: pruritic, not photosensitive, with linear IgG/C3 on DIF [^81a0c938].
- **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**: trauma-induced scarring; linear IgG on DIF [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of porphyria cutanea tarda

PCT results from **reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity** [^236577f9], causing uroporphyrin accumulation and photosensitivity. Triggers include alcohol, hepatitis C, estrogen, iron overload, and UROD mutations [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7].

---

## Pharmacological treatment options

### First-line treatments

Two **first-line therapies** are effective: **phlebotomy** — the standard approach reducing iron and porphyrins [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7] — and **low-dose hydroxychloroquine** (100–200 mg twice weekly), which mobilizes porphyrins via lysosomal pathways and is equivalent to phlebotomy in many patients [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7].

---

### Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Alternative options include **chloroquine** (low-dose, similar mechanism) [^7c857bcd] and **deferasirox** for iron overload when phlebotomy is contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Mechanism of action** | **Relevance to pct** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A. Hemin | Heme administration suppresses ALA synthase | Used for acute porphyrias, not chronic cutaneous PCT | Not indicated [^a72d2df7] |
| B. Prednisone | Anti-inflammatory immunosuppressant | No effect on porphyrin metabolism or photosensitivity | Ineffective [^notfound] |
| C. Fexofenadine | Antihistamine | No effect on porphyrin metabolism or photosensitivity | Not indicated [^notfound] |
| D. Hydroxychloroquine | Lysosomal porphyrin mobilization | Effective first-line therapy for PCT | Recommended [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine

- **Equivalence to phlebotomy**: Low-dose regimens achieve biochemical and clinical remission in most patients [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7].
- **Safety**: Ocular toxicity is rare at low doses; monitor vision periodically [^notfound].
- **Case reports**: Remission documented in familial and acquired PCT [^1c7bec5a] [^f7e85fd4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During treatment, **monitor urinary porphyrins, liver function, and iron indices**; expect remission in 6–12 months and continue surveillance for relapse [^236577f9] [^3d820d47].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **hydroxychloroquine** 100–200 mg twice weekly, a first-line, evidence-based option that improves skin lesions and biochemical markers in PCT [^236577f9] [^a72d2df7].

### An unusual bullous eruption: olanzapine induced pseudoporphyria [^ff136df1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 27-year-old man with a background of schizophrenia presented during the summer months with a 2-day history of a blistering eruption predominantly affecting his hands, forearms and face. He had not knowingly been exposed to any chemicals or toxins and was otherwise well. Clinical examination revealed multiple, large, tense blisters affecting the sun-exposed sites. Histology subsequently demonstrated subepidermal blisters with minimal inflammation and negative immunofluorescence. Porphyrin biochemistry including faecal, urinary and serum samples were unremarkable and thus a diagnosis of pseudoporphyria was reached. There were no obvious triggers, however, olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) had been commenced 2 months previously and was deemed to be the most likely cause. This is the first report of pseudoporphyria being associated with an atypical antipsychotic and highlights the importance of eliciting an accurate drug history by specifically enquiring about any recent medication changes that could account for the clinical presentation.

Case report

A 36-year-old Caucasian male presented for evaluation of a widespread pruritic pustular eruption. It began on the left forearm and spread over 3 weeks to involve both upper and lower extremities with sparing of the trunk, face, hands, and feet. There were no associated constitutional symptoms and no improvement had occurred with a 10-day course of cephalexin followed by a 5-day course of prednisone 50 mg trialed by another physician prior to presentation at our clinic. The patient reported similar but less severe episodes occurring on a monthly basis over the previous 10 years.

His past medical history was significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia managed respectively with bisoprolol and rosuvastatin. He also gave a history of widespread erythema at birth, episodic spontaneous blistering of the skin in childhood and severe generalized xerosis and thickened skin on the extensors beginning in adulthood. The patient had one unaffected sibling, but there was a family history of similar skin problems occurring in his mother and maternal grandfather. There was no family history of psoriasis.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a condition that affects liver and skin by reduction of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity. It is characterized by blistering lesions, erosions and crusts on sun-exposed areas. We report a 51-year-old male presenting with recurrent episodes of bullae, erosions, and crust on his neck and dorsum of the hands for 3 months. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as total plasma porphyrin and urinary uroporphyrin levels were elevated. Based on the clinical manifestations, the history and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of PCT was made. The cutaneous and biochemical abnormalities of the patient improved with therapy of glycyrrhizin.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^960c77ba]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^1c7bec5a]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 55-year-old woman (transgender male-to-female) maintained on oral estradiol for 23 years presented with a 3-month history of burning pain, pruritus, and recurrent blisters on her forearms and hands after exposure to sunlight. One month before symptom onset, the patient initiated a trial of micronized progesterone (100 mg/d) and increased her daily estradiol from 2 mg to 4 mg in an effort to better control gender dysphoria. Her subsequent laboratory findings were notable for a supratherapeutic total estrogen level (1945 pg/mL). Other medications included lisinopril, spironolactone, medroxyprogesterone, and occasional ibuprofen. She denied a personal or family history of liver disease, hepatitis, iron abnormalities, or blistering eruptions. She consumed 2 beers daily and had a 30-pack-year smoking history.

Physical examination confirmed the presence of vesicles and bullae on erythematous bases with scattered milia over the bilateral dorsal forearms, hands, and ears (Figs 1 and 2). Hypertrichosis was not observed or endorsed by the patient. Punch biopsy found a subepidermal blister overlying festooning of the dermal papillae with minimal superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and a negative immunofluorescence examination (Fig 3). A periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative. Laboratory findings revealed mild hepatic transaminitis, negative HIV and hepatitis C antibodies, unremarkable iron studies, elevated total serum porphyrins, urine uroporphyrin and heptaporphyrin, and HFE C282Y heterozygosity (Table I). A liver ultrasound scan was recommended but not obtained. A diagnosis of PCT was discussed with the patient. She was counseled on smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, and photoprotection. She became distressed upon learning that estrogen may be contributing to her symptoms but ultimately decided to temporarily hold estrogen therapy. Hydroxychloroquine, 100 mg twice weekly, was initiated in lieu of repeated phlebotomy due to patient preference. She achieved clinical remission within 5 months without restricting her alcohol or tobacco use. At that time, estradiol was reintroduced via 0.025-mg patch twice weekly without recurrence.

### Erythematous desquamating rash after initiation of chemotherapy [^b18dc007]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pseudoporphyria
B. Photo recall dermatitis
C. Drug-induced phototoxic reaction
D. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction
E. Polymorphous light eruption

Answers:
A. Pseudoporphyria – Incorrect. Pseudoporphyria is a drug induced form of porphyria cutanea tarda that presents with blisters and scarring on sun exposed areas, most commonly the dorsal hands. Blistering occurs quickly after sun exposure, not in the area of previously healed sunburn. Common drug triggers include: naproxen, thiazides, voriconazole, and furosemide.
B. Photo recall dermatitis – Correct. Photo recall dermatitis is an acute inflammatory reaction involving previously sunburned areas that can be triggered by drugs, most commonly chemotherapeutic agents. Patients present with varying degrees of erythema and ulceration in the areas of previous ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, with the potential of progression to necrosis. Her preceding severe sunburn acted as the initial trigger with subsequent chemotherapy driving the cutaneous reaction.
C. Drug-induced phototoxic reaction – Incorrect. Drug-induced phototoxic reactions can present similarly, with the development of confluent erythema and occasional edema, blistering, and desquamation following exposure to a phototoxic substance and UVR. However, phototoxicity usually occurs within 48 hours after the initial exposure to an offending agent, whereas our patient developed an ulcerating rash 2 weeks after initial UVR exposure.
D. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction – Incorrect. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in previously sensitized individuals to the same substance. Patients often complain of itching rather than burning and present with red, scaly papules and plaques in sun-exposed areas.
E. Polymorphous light eruption – Incorrect. Polymorphous light eruptions present as erythematous papules, vesicles, and plaques in sun-exposed areas. This rash tends to present minutes to hours after exposure to UVR and would be less likely to present with erythematous patches in the absence of papulovesicular lesions.

### Pseudoporphyria [^1f91e2da]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pseudoporphyria is the term used to describe a photodistributed bullous disorder with clinical and histologic features of porphyria cutanea tarda, but without accompanying biochemical porphyrin abnormalities. Medications, chronic renal failure/dialysis, excessive sun exposure and UVA radiation have all been reported to cause pseudoporphyria. Recognition, diagnosis, and appropriate management of pseudoporphyria are discussed.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^3d820d47]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a rare disease characterized by fragile skin and blistering on sun-exposed areas. Increased urinary porphyrin excretion causes red- or dark-coloured urine. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by hepatic iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens, hepatitis C and various liver stressors, in combination with exposure to light. The prevalence of symptomatic disease is estimated to be 1 in 10 000. The condition exists in both a familial and sporadic subtype. Compared with 25% of cases worldwide, about 50% of cases of PCT in Norway are hereditary because of two founder mutations. Penetrance is very low, and only an estimated 10% of mutation carriers develop symptoms throughout life. Treatment consists of avoidance of precipitating factors, phlebotomy to reduce iron or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chloroquine.

It might take 6–15 months before complete clinical and biochemical remission is reached, but the prognosis is good, and many patients experience lifelong remission. To detect relapse, urinary porphyrin concentration, iron and liver functions should be assessed annually.

The principal aim of the Norwegian Porphyria Centre is to optimize the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with porphyria. Although the clinical benefits of mutation screening are controversial, distinguishing between sporadic and familial cases appears to be important to many patients and their relatives, and NAPOS therefore offers, in hereditary cases, predictive genetic testing and counselling to at-risk adult family members.

Photodermatoses can have a high psychological impact. Jong et al.investigated quality of life (QoL) in patients with a range of photodermatoses, including PCT. They concluded that, overall, photodermatoses had a major impact on QoL, but that PCT had a lower impact on QoL than did other cutaneous porphyrias. Very little knowledge of the psychosocial impact of PCT is available and more information on the subjective experiences is therefore needed to secure optimal treatment, follow-up and counselling of this group. The aim of the present study was therefore to explore the experiences persons with PCT have regarding symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

### Exacerbation of bullous pemphigoid after hand, foot, and mouth disease treated with rituximab [^d2abb713]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A 56-year-old white man with a history of asthma, chronic renal failure, and stable BP presented with complaints of worsening pruritic vesicles over the course of 2 months. These lesions developed 2 months after contracting a severe case of HFMD diagnosed by his primary care physician. His diagnosis was based on his high fevers and severe blistering on his hands, feet, and mouth, and he was confined to bed for 2 weeks amid a coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) breakout in the summer of 2012. His primary care physician prescribed prednisone, 40 to 60 mg orally daily, which resulted in mild-to-moderate control of his blisters.

Before his CVA6 infection, his BP was in complete remission on a regimen of prednisone, 10 mg orally every other day. He presented to our dermatology clinic with his post–CVA6-induced flare, at which time his physical examination found 40% to 50% of his body surface area covered with tense bullae, erosions, and crust located on his face, neck, chest, abdomen, back, buttocks, genitalia, and bilateral upper and lower extremities, with sparing of the oral mucosa (Fig 1, A and B). In addition, his laboratory, histopathology, and direct immunofluorescence findings all supported a diagnosis of BP at that time. Results of a paraneoplastic pemphigus panel were normal, and the pemphigoid panel found an elevated BP 230 IgG antibody level (106 U; normal < 9 U) and slightly elevated BP 180 IgG antibody level (25 U; normal < 9 U; ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, Utah).

### Olaparib-induced pseudoporphyria in a patient with ovarian cancer [^a026c7a9]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudoporphyria is a rare and poorly understood bullous photodermatosis associated with certain phototoxic medications, UV radiation, hemodialysis, and indoor tanning bed use. Although pseudoporphyria closely resembles porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) from a clinical and histologic standpoint, there are characteristically no laboratory abnormalities. Patients with pseudoporphyria typically present with skin fragility, vesicles, bullae, milia, and/or scarring in photoexposed areas. Although involvement of the dorsal aspect of the hands is most common, the characteristic lesions of pseudoporphyria can also be found on the extensor legs, fingers, upper portion of the chest, and face.

Clinical history-taking is essential because patients with pseudoporphyria will often have a history of chronic renal disease, indoor tanning bed use, or recent exposure to phototoxic medications. Although many medications have been reported to cause pseudoporphyria, propionic acid derivative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen, are the most reported culprit. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as olaparib, are not a commonly known cause of pseudoporphyria.

### Vesiculobullous skin lesions on the hands and face [^ccd884bb]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old man presented at the dermatology clinic with bullous lesions on his hands that had appeared 3 months earlier, in early summer. Upon examination, bilateral tightly roofed vesicles on his hands, along with milium-grain scars (Fig 1), crusted erosions on the face and hands (Figs 1 and 2), bilateral malar hypertrichosis (Fig 3), diffuse skin pigmentation, and port-red urine were observed. The skin biopsy showed dermal-epidermal junctional cleavage without alteration in the epidermal roof or dermal inflammatory infiltrate.

Question 1: What is the likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous pemphigoid
B. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)
C. Scabies
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus
E. Contact dermatitis

Answers:
A. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Bullous pemphigoid typically presents with tense bullae on erythematous skin, without the characteristic features of PCT such as malar hypertrichosis or port-red urine.
B. PCT – Correct. The presented clinical features, including vesiculobullous lesions in photo-exposed areas, milium-grain scars, malar hypertrichosis, skin pigmentation, and port-red urine, are typical of PCT. It is a rare skin disorder resulting from acquired or inherited hepatic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
C. Scabies – Incorrect. Scabies usually causes intense itching and burrows in the skin, including in interdigital spaces.
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Systemic lupus erythematosus may present with cutaneous manifestations on sun-exposed areas, but it is characterized by a prominent rash on the cheeks and nose, commonly known as a "butterfly rash".
E. Contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Contact dermatitis typically presents with erythema, edema, and vesicles in areas of contact with an offending agent, which does not match the presentation described in the case.

### Pseudoporphyria: discussion of etiologic agents [^064a30ff]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudoporphyria describes a photodistributed bullous disorder with negative urinary, fecal, and serum porphyrin studies. Although pseudoporphyria is thought to be extremely rare (less than 100 reported cases4-5), we propose that this entity is underreported. One author (KB) has seen four cases of pseudoporphyria in the past four years. We describe a patient with nonpruritic, nonpainful bulla on the dorsum of his hands. Biopsy revealed a split at the dermal-epidermal junction; laboratory tests and urinary porphyrin evaluation were negative.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — case 6 presents a 29-year-old man with a family history of psoriasis who developed plaque type psoriasis at 12 years of age initially treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, with progressive worsening over the subsequent 6 years. He was treated initially with 15 mg per week of oral methotrexate (MTX) that led to significant elevations in his liver function test (LFT) findings after 9 months of therapy requiring discontinuation, failed to respond to a 12-week course of intramuscular alefacept, and thereafter obtained significant improvement with etanercept; approximately 7 months after his last etanercept dose an upper respiratory infection led to rapid worsening with involvement of most of his body surface area (BSA) sparing only the palms and soles. On examination he was afebrile with other vital signs within normal limits and had generalized erythematous inflammatory patches and plaques covering 95% of his BSA with superficial exfoliation of the face, palms, and soles, pitting edema of the lower extremities, and swelling of the toes without any specific individual joint tenderness.

### Toxic exanthems in the adult population [^a48abc59]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Frequently the internist is confronted with the nonspecific exanthematous eruption. While often a sign of a benign and self-limiting process, an exanthem also might herald the development of a more severe systemic syndrome. Infections, immune-mediated processes, drug reactions, a neoplasm, and familial syndromes with poor prognoses might all manifest initially with an exanthem. A thorough history and complete physical examination should be performed on all patients who present with an exanthem. Characterization of the exanthem morphology, other physical examination findings, and review of systems can help guide laboratory testing and ensure prompt diagnosis and early treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions. This article provides a brief overview of the conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of an ill patient with an exanthem.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^5f790e35]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Solar urticaria — clinical features and natural history describe rapid onset of wheals with sun exposure, generally within 1–3 minutes, with typical wheals developing within 1 to 3 minutes and a 1- to 3-hour delay reported but less typical. Symptoms usually resolve after stopping exposure, usually within 30 minutes and almost always within 24 hours, though in rare cases they can persist for more than 24 hours. It is initially present in pediatric and older adult (age > 65 years) patients, with a usual age of onset between 20 and 41 years, and retrospective studies suggest resolution in 15% to 86% of patients after 5 years of symptoms. Triggers include UVB (280–320 nm), UVA (320–400 nm), visible light (400–600 nm), and even infrared (> 600 nm) radiation.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^2eff08ac]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Photolocalized varicella
B. Phototoxic drug reaction
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Photolocalized varicella – Correct. Varicella is a common viral infection with a characteristic exanthem. Although viral rashes aggravated by sun exposure, trauma, and inflammation have been described, photolocalized varicella is rare, and the typical distribution may not be seen. As with our patient, a mild viral prodrome or constitutional symptoms are often reported. This case highlights the importance of including varicella in the differential diagnosis of a photolocalized eruption, especially in a patient with a known history of exposure and immunosuppression.
B. Phototoxic drug reaction – Incorrect. Phototoxic drug reactions present as more similar to a sunburn than to a pruritic eruption. Commonly reported etiologic drugs include vemurafenib, voriconazole, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone, and chlorpromazine. This patient was taking only ustekinumab and prednisone.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of porphyrin accumulation and is characterized by painful vesicles that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the hands and face. Most cases are due to acquired or inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.
D. PMLE – Incorrect. PMLE is an idiopathic photodermatosis that can present with a wide range of morphologies.PMLE can affect any skin type but is more commonly reported in lighter skin types. Systemic symptoms are rare in PMLE.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that usually presents symmetrically as an annular or papulosquamous eruption distributed on the sun-exposed sites of the skin.

Question 2: Which of the following is a risk factor for development of this condition in this patient?
A. Age over 70
B. Prior history of radiation therapy
C. Prior history of melanoma
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer
E. All of the above

Answer:
A. Age over 70 – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
B. Prior history of radiation therapy – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
C. Prior history of melanoma – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
E. All of the above – Correct. All of the above listed answer choices are risk factors for BP. Based on a recent propensity score-matched case-control study, age greater than 70 years at the time of receiving first immune checkpoint inhibitor cycle, history of melanoma, and history of nonmelanoma skin cancers are all associated with increased risk of developing BP among a cohort of patients treated with ICIs. Radiotherapy is also an independent risk factor for BP. While the underlying pathophysiology is unknown, it has been hypothesized that radiotherapy causes tissue damage, leading to increased antigen exposure and increased autoantibody production. In addition to the risk factor of ICI usage, BP onset in this patient is likely associated with radiotherapy exposure given localized distribution of disease in previously irradiated areas on bilateral cheeks.

Variegate porphyria (VP) is a rare subtype of porphyrias characterized by dysfunction of enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway leading to an accumulation of porphyrins and their precursors. The resulting buildup can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms and photosensitive blistering eruptions on sun-exposed skin. We report a case of VP in a 9-year-old girl with many confounding medical factors that warranted alternative explanations for her cutaneous lesions. VP has been reported infrequently in the pediatric population and is associated with more severe neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to adult-onset disease.

### Eruptive keratoacanthomas secondary to topical 5-fluorouracil application [^b503731a]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A man in his 60s with a history of eruptive and reactive KAs and squamous cell carcinoma after trauma presented with a 2-week history of painful, pruritic, and enlarging nodules on his left arm during the use of 5% 5-FU cream to treat multiple actinic keratoses on both forearms. He began to develop the lesions 2 weeks into a 4-week course, which he completed. Of note, he had a history of both spontaneous KAs and KA-like squamous cell carcinomas as well as trauma-induced (after excision and injury) lesions on his upper and lower extremities for the preceding 5 years. Physical examination revealed multiple, tender, hyperkeratotic, and erythematous crateriform nodules with central ulceration on the left forearm at the sites of 5-FU application for actinic keratoses (Fig 1). Biopsy findings were consistent with KA. While he did have a history of eruptive KAs (between 10 and 15 lesions), he had never developed so many large, painful lesions over such a short period of time. There are multiple reports of eruptive KA being associated with internal malignancy. Given this abrupt eruption and significant smoking history (> 30 pack years), a low-dose chest computed tomography scan was obtained and was unremarkable. The patient was also up to date with his age-appropriate malignancy screening. Review of systems was non-contributory. Of note, he had used 5-FU cream on his face before and did not have a similar reaction.

Fig 1
Eruptive keratoacanthomas: multiple hyperkeratotic and erythematous crateriform nodules with central ulceration on the left forearm at the sites of 5-fluorouracil application.

Because of the clinical and histopathologic features, the patient was diagnosed with eruptive KAs secondary to topical 5-FU application for the treatment of actinic keratoses. He was treated with acitretin 10 mg daily in addition to serial shave excisions followed by intralesional 5-FU, which was well tolerated and led to a decrease in pruritus. One month after initiating therapy, there was a decrease in the size and number of lesions, resulting in an overall improvement in skin disease (Fig 2).

### Very early diagnosis and management of congenital erythropoietic porphyria [^0312b6ee]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a rare form of porphyria. This autosomal recessive inherited heme metabolism disorder is caused by a defect of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), an enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase deficiency leads to an accumulation of porphyrins in the erythroid precursors of bone marrow, red blood cells, and tissues such as skin, bones, teeth, and spleen. - The exposure of nonphysiological accumulated porphyrins to sunlight causes oxidative stress leading to cell death.

More than 50 pathogenic mutations in UROS have been identified explaining the various clinical presentations of CEP ranging from severe antenatal manifestations causing hydrops fetalis to adult-onset mild cutaneous lesions. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is characterized by severe skin photosensitivity and skin fragility, causing blisters, erosions, secondary skin infections, and later changes such as atrophy and mutilating scars. Accumulated porphyrins in the erythroid precursor of bone marrow and red blood cells result in ineffective erythropoiesis and long-term intravascular hemolysis. Other manifestations of CEP such as brown-red urine, erythrodontia, corneal ulceration, osteoporosis, and pathological bone fractures are corollaries of excessive porphyrins deposition in tissues. The diagnostic of CEP is based on the markedly elevated levels of porphyrins in urine, clinically observed with a dark-brown staining of the diapers. High levels of porphyrins in red blood cells and feces are also noted. Genetic testing identifying UROS mutation confirms the diagnosis.

Patients suffering from CEP have a poor outcome and quality of life. Several supportive therapies such as strict sun avoidance, physical sunblocks, red blood cells transfusions, hydroxyureaand splenectomyare commonly used in the management of CEP. Currently, the only available curative treatment of CEP is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this article, we present, to our knowledge, the youngest case of successful HSCT for CEP.

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^564a1bf9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient's condition?
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers:
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### The management of porphyria cutanea tarda [^7c857bcd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the commonest of all porphyrias, is usually characterized by blisters and fragility of skin in light-exposed areas. It can be clinically indistinguishable from other disorders including variegate porphyria and the diagnosis can only be made by rigorous biochemical analysis. PCT does not cause acute attacks of porphyria. It is usually an acquired condition caused by inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme in the liver. Hereditary haemochromatosis, hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol, oestrogens and a family history of PCT are the major risk factors for the condition and should be searched for specifically in all patients. Liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is common in patients with PCT, and should be investigated for at presentation by means of a liver biopsy where possible. Patients with severe hepatic pathology or longstanding untreated PCT need to be monitored for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the long term. Low dose twice weekly chloroquine is the mainstay of treatment, but venesection should be used in patients with severe iron overload or hepatitis C-related liver disease. Subsequently, long-term follow-up is needed in all patients to monitor for relapse.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: recent update [^236577f9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common human porphyria, due to hepatic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), which is acquired in the presence of iron overload and various susceptibility factors, such as alcohol abuse, smoking, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV infection, iron overload with HFE gene mutations, use of estrogens, and UROD mutation. Patients with familial or type II PCT due to autosomal dominant UROD mutation also require other susceptibility factors, as the disease phenotype requires hepatic UROD deficiency to below 20% of normal. PCT clinically manifests with increased skin fragility and blistering skin lesions on sun exposed areas. The common age of presentation is 5th to 6th decade and occurs slightly more commonly in males. Although mild liver biochemical profile are common, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can occasionally develop. Screening for HCC using ultrasound examination is recommended in PCT patients, especially with cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis. PCT is effectively and readily treatable with the use of either repeated phlebotomy or use of 100 mg hydroxychloroquine orally twice a week, and both the treatments are equally effective and safe. With the advent of new or direct antiviral agents for HCV infection, treatment of concomitant HCV has become safer and effective. Data are emerging on the benefit of these drugs as monotherapy for both PCT and HCV. After the achievement of remission of PCT, there remains a potential for relapse, especially when the susceptibility factors are not adequately controlled. Scanty data from retrospective and observational studies shows the relapse rate to be somewhat higher after remission with low-dose hydroxychloroquine as compared to phlebotomy induced remission. Future studies are needed on exploring mechanism of action of 4-aminoquinolines, understanding interaction of HCV and PCT, and relapse of PCT on long-term follow-up.

The most common peripheral eruptive maculopapular rash, erythema multiforme occurs more frequently in men than in women and most often affects persons between 20 and 30 years of age. The rash, which can be recurrent, shows a predilection for palms, soles, knees and elbows. Although erythema multiforme has a number of known etiologies, 1, 4, 6 it is idiopathic in more than 50 percent of affected patients. 1, 6. The characteristic vesicular rash of herpes zoster usually affects a single dermatome and rarely crosses the midline.

The most common locations are the chest and the face. 20 A prodrome of unusual skin sensations may evolve into pain, burning and paresthesias, which precede the rash by two to three days. OTHER CAUSES Staphylococcal bacteremia may present with a widespread pustular eruption. Gonococcemia may also produce a pustular rash, although other lesion types, such as macules, petechiae and papules, are usually present. 3 In immunocompromised patients, disseminated herpes simplex virus infection must be considered. Patients with underlying liver disease, renal dysfunction or diabetes are particularly susceptible to infection with. The course of erythema nodosum depends on the specific cause, but spontaneous resolution can be expected within six weeks. 1, 2 OTHER CAUSES In immunocompromised patients, disseminated fungal infections may produce nodular lesions.

Disseminated candidiasis may present with diffuse nonerythematous nodules in an immunocompromised patient who has fever and myalgias. Other fungal infections to consider include cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis and sporotrichosis. 2.

### Postangioedema attack skin blisters: an unusual presentation of hereditary angioedema [^33c52744]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by attacks of self-limited swelling affecting extremities, face and intra-abdominal organs, most often caused by mutations in the C1-inhibitor gene with secondary Bradykinin-mediated increased vascular permeability. We describe a 36-year-old man with a history of HAE who presented with painful interdigital bullae secondary to an acute oedema exacerbation. Biopsy and cultures of the lesions were negative and they resolved spontaneously. It is important to highlight and recognise the development of oedema blisters after resolution of a flare of HAE (only 1 previous case report), and hence avoid unnecessary dermatological diagnostic workup and treatment.

### The cutaneous porphyrias [^aacc3935]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks. The cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis, complications, and current approach to porphyria management. Although focusing mainly on their dermatological aspects, the article also covers the management of acute porphyria, which by virtue of its association with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, may become the responsibility of the clinical dermatologist.

### Porphyrias [^58e5aa2e]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Seven different porphyrias form a group of inherited metabolic disorders, each resulting from a partial deficiency of a specific enzyme in the haem biosynthesis pathway. Clinically, the three most important entities are an acute porphyric attack and acute and chronic skin symptoms. Porphyrias are rare and sometimes misdiagnosed, because various symptoms and signs mimic other diseases. Once porphyria is suspected, biochemical analyses easily detect porphyrins and their precursors from blood, urine, or faeces. Mutation screening can be done at the quiescent phase of the disease. Pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical manifestations differ in individual porphyrias and most of them require a specific treatment. Early diagnosis and information about precipitating factors can diminish mortality and prevent subsequent attacks among patients with acute porphyrias, so mutation screening is recommended for family members.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda presenting as cicatricial conjunctivitis [^84fc47c9]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of porphyria cutanea tarda presenting as cicatricial conjunctivitis.

Design

Observational study.

Methods

A 31-year-old man presented with bilateral inferior symblepharon, superior tarsal conjunctival scarring and concretions, and recurrent conjunctival and episcleral injection.

Results

Four years after initial presentation, the patient developed hepatitis C, and 2 years later blisters on his scalp and hands. Direct immunofluorescence studies of biopsies taken from the palpebral conjunctiva of the right lower lid were negative for cicatricial pemphigoid. A twenty-four hour urine specimen analysis revealed elevated levels of uroporphyrins and polycarboxylated porphyrins, confirming the diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda. The patient was treated with repeated phlebotomies and oral hydroxychloroquine, which resulted in a significant decrease in the skin lesions, conjunctival injection, and concretions under the upper lids.

Conclusions

Cicatricial conjunctivitis may be a manifestation of porphyria cutanea tarda.

### Dermal toxicity associated with epibatidine exposure [^69d761e3]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Epibatidine is an alkaloid similar to nicotine, which was originally discovered in the skin of the Ecuadorian poisonous frog. A number of synthetic preparations are available, and it is subject to medical research for a variety of disorders. This article describes a previously healthy 25-year-old researcher who developed an itchy, vesicular rash after working for around 2 h in a laboratory environment with epibatidine hydrochloride (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO, USA). An urticarial rash developed on the extensor surfaces of forearms, calves, axillae, and upper torso. Mucous membranes were spared, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The patient had a history of asthma, but no documented allergy or skin disorder, and no family history of atopy. He underwent treatment with oral prednisolone 40 mg, and regular oral chlorpheniramine 4 mg three times daily, and the rash had fully resolved in 1 week.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^e449e604]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic approach for this disease?
A. Autoantibody profile
B. Biochemical porphyrin profile
C. History and physical
D. Skin biopsy
E. VZV polymerase chain reaction

Answers:
A. Autoantibody profile – Incorrect. An autoantibody profile would be more useful for the diagnosis of connective tissue disease when there is clinical suspicion. Specifically, autoantibodies are frequently associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Depending on the review of systems findings and clinical systemic symptoms, further laboratory testing may be indicated.
B. Biochemical porphyrin profile – Incorrect. The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda is often confirmed by obtaining a biochemical porphyrin profile. In porphyria cutanea tarda, urinary porphyrins and plasma porphyrins are elevated. Fecal porphyrins may be elevated as well. Urinary excretion of porphobilinogen is normal, differentiating porphyria cutanea tarda from other porphyrias.
C. History and physical – Incorrect. Although a thorough history and physical is an important method for any diagnosis, this patient's atypical presentation and the rarity of this diagnosis required further laboratory confirmation.
D. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. Although skin biopsy can be utilized to make the correct diagnosis, a noninvasive diagnostic technique would be preferred as the next diagnostic step. On histopathologic examination, varicella will show multinucleated giant cellswith nuclear molding, cytopathic effect, and mild leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
E. VZV polymerase chain reaction – Correct. This patient's diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to detect VZV. Serologic techniques can also be used to diagnose VZV, with active infection revealing elevated IgM titers. Studies have demonstrated that immunologic techniques and molecular amplification are superior for VZV detection when compared with serologic techniques.

### Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus versus discoid lupus erythematosus: a challenging diagnosis [^73c182b3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In both these patients, there were overlapping features of both SCLE and DLE. Distinguishing between SCLE and DLE can be a challenging diagnosis; however, there are several characteristic features to consider — distribution, active lesion morphology, and scarring.

Photosensitivity can be seen in all subtypes of CLE, and the reported incidence by subtype varies widely – 27% to 100% in SCLE and 25% to 90% in DLE. Unsurprisingly, SCLE and DLE lesions are often found on sun-exposed skin. SCLE tends to appear on the upper thorax ("V" distribution), upper portion of the back, and extensor surfaces of the arms and forearms, sparing the central portion of the face, scalp, and below the waist. In drug-induced SCLE, accounting for up to 38% of cases, lesions can also be found in sun-protected areas. DLE predominantly involves the head and neck regions, particularly the scalp and ears, but it can also involve the extensor arms and hands in generalized DLE. DLE can affect mucosal surfaces as well. Both patients had lesion distribution in sun-exposed areas, as seen in both SCLE and DLE. Additionally, they both had face, scalp, and ears involvement, and patient 2 had mucosal surface involvement. Although these specific areas may be more characteristic of DLE, they do not rule out SCLE.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^dbaf2064]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Living with a rare genetic disease

Individuals with protoporphyria can experience severe pain when exposed to sunlight, and efforts to avoid symptoms markedly impair quality of life. The pain experienced is out of proportion to the degree of visible skin damage, which is often minimal or absent. Therefore, patients, especially children and young adults, find explaining this "invisible" condition to others challenging. In managing patients with protoporphyria, addressing and validating psychosocial concerns and encouraging access to online resources, patient support groups, expert centers, clinical trials, and specialized programs for affected children is critical.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^e5d47e4b]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this patient?
A. Drug discontinuation
B. Hydroxychloroquine
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir
D. Phlebotomy
E. Supportive care

Answers:
A. Drug discontinuation – Incorrect. In phototoxic drug reactions, the mainstay of treatment is the identification and cessation of the causative agent. In cases where discontinuation is not possible, patients should be instructed to avoid the sun and practice strict sun protection.
B. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine are the first-line systemic therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Systemic medications are recommended in cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that are severe, widespread, or refractory to topical therapies.
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir – Correct. The treatment of choice for VZV infection in individuals at a greater risk for complications, including adults and immunocompromised patients, is antiviral therapy. The most commonly used antiviral agents are acyclovir and valacyclovir, which function by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and subsequently VZV replication. Our patient was treated with 1 gram of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 14 days and reported significant improvement after completion of the treatment course.
D. Phlebotomy – Incorrect. The standard treatment for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda is regular phlebotomy to reduce iron and porphyrin levels in the liver.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Varicella has a low complication rate, especially in children, and can be treated symptomatically. However, in immunosuppressed patients, antivirals should be promptly initiated to minimize the risk of complications.

Ultraviolet B case — A 51-year-old postmenopausal woman with a 25-year history of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis had 15% BSA involvement and reported excess alcohol intake (12–18 beers each weekend). In this context, narrowband (NB)-UVB is an attractive treatment option; NB-UVB is well tolerated, cost effective, and can be used safely in patients with demyelinating disease, in which the use of TNF-α–inhibiting biologic agents is contraindicated. NB-UVB can be administered in an outpatient setting or in a day hospital, while PUVA photochemotherapy is likely to be more efficacious in darker-skinned individuals or those with very thick lesions because of the better penetration of UVA compared with UVB. NB-UVB has many advantages over PUVA, including a lower long-term photocarcinogenic risk, lack of need for oral medication before each treatment session or photoprotective eyewear between treatments, and safety in pregnancy, though remission duration with NB-UVB is shorter. UV-based therapy often requires 2 to 3 visits per week; after clearance, home NB-UVB phototherapy for maintenance is an attractive alternative. If adequate response is not obtained after approximately 20 to 30 treatments with NB-UVB given 2 to 3 times weekly, PUVA, traditional systemic agents, or biologic agents should be considered, and because of significant alcohol intake, MTX would be contraindicated in this patient.

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^a72d2df7]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

### Guide to porphyrias. A historical and clinical perspective [^6dd99949]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis classified as neurovisceral, cutaneous, or mixed. A deficiency of any of the 8 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms. Classification depends on the defective enzyme. Porphyrias often are misdiagnosed because patients have vague symptoms. However, acute forms of porphyria can be life-threatening, so it is important to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate proper medical management. We discuss the history, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of porphyrias and then briefly describe the 8 types of porphyrias and their distinguishing features.

### Phlebotomy as an efficient long-term treatment of congenital erythropoietic porphyria [^f44113d3]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

The study was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.

A 49-year-old Caucasian female was treated for CEP by repeated phlebotomies for almost 2 years. She was diagnosed with CEP at the age of 25 after experiencing symptoms since the age of 4, including photosensitivity with skin fragility, blistering and scarring, mouth lesions with erythrodontia, microstomia and gum recession, sclerodermiform retraction of the skin on the face and hands and loss of a distal phalange. She showed moderate chronic hemolysis. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous UROS variant, p. Gly58Arg, resulting in markedly decreased UROS activity in red blood cells (1.7 U/mg Hb/h, N > 6). The patient was treated mainly with supportive measures, such as sun avoidance. At diagnosis, urine porphyrin levels were 2642 nmol/mmol of creatinine (URO 1602 nmol/mmol and COPRO 1040 nmol/mmol). Treatment started with the removal of 100 mL of blood twice a month for 1 month. The volume of blood was then increased by 50 mL each month or each 6 weeks until reaching 300 mL. This gradual increase of the volume of blood withdrawn was to avoid a strong induction of erythropoiesis. The iron store was efficiently depleted 8 months after the first phlebotomy, and the ferritin level decreased to 10.4 mg/L (Figure 1A). Concomitantly, we observed a significant decrease in urine and plasma porphyrin levels to 389 nmol/mmol and 50 nmol/L, respectively, corresponding to 79% and 85% decreases compared to the baseline levels. A progressive normalization of haptoglobin levels occurred which was associated with a decrease in reticulocyte count, showing discontinuation of hemolysis (Figure 1C). Photosensitivity markedly improved, and the urine became clearer. Phlebotomies were discontinued for 3 months, resulting in an increase in urine and plasma porphyrins (urine porphyrins 1956 nmol/mmol, plasma porphyrins 219 nmol/L) associated with worsening photosensitivity. Phlebotomies were reintroduced at month 11, on a monthly basis, progressively increasing the blood volume over 7 months until reaching 300 mL. Phlebotomies were then continued at 200 mL monthly. At month 18, low levels of urine and plasma porphyrins were obtained again (460 nmol/mmol and 31 nmol/L, respectively). Finally, at month 23, urine and plasma porphyrin levels were reduced to 271 nmol/mmol and 26 nmol/L (83% and 91% reductions compared to baseline), close to levels observed after BMT. During the course of treatment, total erythrocyte porphyrins levels were moderately reduced (8.7 mmol/L at baseline, 7.3 mmol/L at month 23; 16% decrease) (Figure 1B). Chromatography of erythrocyte porphyrins prior to phlebotomies revealed that these were composed of 62,4% protoporyphin IX (PPIX) (5.43 mmol/L), 19.9% URO (1.73 mmol/L) and 15% COPRO (1.30 mmol/L). At month 23 of treatment, erythrocyte porphyrin chromatography showed a large decrease in URO (1.1%, 0.08 mmol/L; 95% decrease compared to baseline) and COPRO (8.6%, 0.63 mmol/L, 51% decrease compared to baseline) and an increase in the amount of PPIX (89.3%, 6.52 mmol/L; 20% increase; 76% of zinc PPIX) due to iron-deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin levels remained greater than 10 g/dL. Clinical tolerance was good with moderate asthenia. The patient's urine became clear. No adverse effects were detected. The biological and clinical improvement allowed the patient to have unrestricted exposure to sun during the summer without showing any signs of blistering.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^d390748d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Clopidogrel hypersensitivity — incidence, presentation, and diagnostic notes include that clopidogrel (Plavix) is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation for oral use, and the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions has been reported to range from 1% to 6%, with most estimates ranging from 1% to 3%. The most common hypersensitivity reaction is rash — macular, morbilliform, or diffuse and erythematous — beginning about 5 days into treatment; IgE-mediated reactions comprise about 5% to 7%, and in one case series urticaria represented 17% of reactions to clopidogrel. There is no validated skin testing or patch testing to clopidogrel, though the largest case series (42 patients) evaluated both immediate hypersensitivity testing and patch testing after a history suggestive of hypersensitivity; of the 42 patients tested, most had a history consistent with a delayed rash.

The family history has its origins in genealogy and over the past century has become embedded in clinical practice. Its importance in specialized circumstances is unquestioned but largely untested. Moreover, the relevance of the family history to common diseases, especially in an era of genomic markers that convey risk and the emphasis on "personalized medicine", must be given careful scrutiny. Given the time and expertise needed to obtain and interpret the family history, without a clearer sense of clinical validity and utility, its role will likely diminish.

The cutaneous manifestations include darkening of the skin especially in sun-exposed areas and hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases, frictional surfaces, vermilion border, recent scars, genital skin, and oral mucosa. Measurement of basal plasma cortisol is an insensitive screening test. Synthetic adrenocorticotropin 1–24 at a dose of 250 microg works well as a dynamic test. Elevated plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin and renin confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves replacement of the deficient hormones.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^9bd6b943]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

EPP and XLP are nonblistering cutaneous porphyrias characterized by excess protoporphyrin in the bone marrow and high levels of circulating protoporphyrin, resulting in photosensitivity and an increased risk of biliary stones and liver damage. Recommended management includes monitoring for liver damage and other disease-related complications. Although the understanding of the molecular basis and clinical presentation of protoporphyrias has advanced, the development of novel and promising new therapies has occurred only recently. Therefore, it is becoming even more important for physicians to be aware of the diagnosis and management of these rare, but often undiagnosed, conditions.

5.11 Serious Skin Reactions

Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [SJS] and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis [TEN]) have been reported in patients receiving topiramate. TOPAMAX should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. Inform patients about the signs of serious skin reactions.
