## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the principle of comparative advantage applies only to international trade. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of comparative advantage and whether it hinges on national borders. Then, I should verify whether the logic generalizes to any two productive units with different relative efficiencies. Next, I will check for counterexamples or edge cases that might limit applicability. Finally, I will align the correct answer with the most defensible option and briefly explain why the alternatives are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the principle itself. Comparative advantage arises when two agents have different relative efficiencies across tasks, so each specializes in the task with the lower opportunity cost and then trades, yielding mutual gains even if one agent is absolutely less efficient in everything. This is the Ricardian logic, and it does not inherently require that the agents be countries or that trade cross national borders [^6febe695].

> Wait, let me verify whether this generalizes beyond nations. The same mathematical structure applies whenever there are two productive units with differing relative efficiencies, whether those units are individuals, households, firms, regions, or countries. The Nash equilibrium framing in microbial trade models even shows how differing metabolic efficiencies lead to specialization and exchange dynamics, underscoring that the concept is domain-general rather than tied to geopolitical boundaries [^6febe695].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for common misconceptions. Some might say comparative advantage is "only international", but that conflates the historical context of trade examples with the logical structure of the principle. The economic logic is about relative opportunity costs and gains from specialization and trade, which can emerge domestically within a country, within a firm, or even at the cellular level, so restricting it to international trade is a mistake [^6febe695].

> I will now examine the answer choices against this reasoning. Options asserting exclusivity to international trade (C, E, H, J) are incorrect because the principle's applicability is not contingent on national borders. Options limiting it to consumer choice, services only, domestic trade only, financial markets, barter, or intra-firm division of labor (A, B, F, G, H, I) are too narrow and mischaracterize the generality of the logic. The correct framing is that comparative advantage applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies, which matches option D [^6febe695].

> Final answer: D. No, it applies wherever productive units have different relative efficiencies [^6febe695].

---

The principle of **comparative advantage** is not limited to international trade; it applies whenever entities have different relative efficiencies, including within countries, firms, or individuals [^6febe695]. Specialization and trade based on comparative advantage yield gains whenever opportunity costs differ, regardless of whether the exchange is domestic or international. Thus, options A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, and J are incorrect, and the correct answer is **D**.

---

## Definition and core concept

Comparative advantage is the ability to produce a good or service at a **lower opportunity cost** than another entity. It underpins gains from specialization and trade, even when one party has an absolute advantage in all goods [^6febe695].

---

## Application beyond international trade

### Domestic trade

Within a country, regions, firms, or individuals often have different relative efficiencies. For example, agricultural regions may specialize in farming while urban areas focus on manufacturing or services, yielding mutual gains through domestic trade.

---

### Firm-level specialization

Within firms, employees specialize in tasks where they have a comparative advantage, improving overall productivity and efficiency. This mirrors the principle at the organizational level.

---

### Individual decision-making

Individuals apply comparative advantage when choosing careers or tasks based on their relative strengths, optimizing personal and societal outcomes through specialization.

---

## Examples illustrating broader applicability

| **Context** | **Example** |
|-|-|
| Domestic trade | - Silicon Valley specializes in tech <br/> - Midwest in agriculture |
| Firm-level | - Engineers design <br/> - Marketers promote <br/> - Manufacturers produce |
| Individual | - A doctor practices medicine <br/> - A teacher educates <br/> - A chef cooks |

---

## Misconceptions and limitations

Common misconceptions include that comparative advantage applies only to international trade or only to goods (not services). In reality, it applies to **any exchange** where relative efficiencies differ, including services, labor, and capital. Limitations arise when mobility, information, or market failures constrain specialization.

---

## Conclusion

The principle of **comparative advantage** extends beyond international trade to any setting with differing relative efficiencies, including domestic trade, firms, and individuals. The correct answer is **D**.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6c2469ac]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults states that for asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency (I statement). It applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended and does not apply to persons who are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes. Implementation notes add that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for vitamin D deficiency, and the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF statement.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^dc64b4b4]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)," specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years," and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)." For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses." The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications," citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings." The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology."

### No surgical innovation without evaluation: evolution and further development of the IDEAL framework and recommendations [^7597c95c]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update, clarify, and extend IDEAL concepts and recommendations.

Background

New surgical procedures, devices, and other complex interventions need robust evaluation for safety, efficacy, and effectiveness. Unlike new medicines, there is no internationally agreed evaluation pathway for generating and analyzing data throughout the life cycle of surgical innovations. The IDEAL Framework and Recommendations were designed to provide this pathway and they have been used increasingly since their introduction in 2009. Based on a Delphi survey, expert workshop and major discussions during IDEAL conferences held in Oxford (2016) and New York (2017), this article updates and extends the IDEAL Recommendations, identifies areas for future research, and discusses the ethical problems faced by investigators at each IDEAL stage.

Methods

The IDEAL Framework describes 5 stages of evolution for new surgical therapeutic interventions-Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and Long-term Study. This comprehensive update proposes several modifications. First, a "Pre-IDEAL" stage describing preclinical studies has been added. Second we discuss potential adaptations to expand the scope of IDEAL (originally designed for surgical procedures) to accommodate therapeutic devices, through an IDEAL-D variant. Third, we explicitly recognise the value of comprehensive data collection through registries at all stages in the Framework and fourth, we examine the ethical issues that arise at each stage of IDEAL and underpin the recommendations. The Recommendations for each stage are reviewed, clarified and additional detail added.

Conclusions

The intention of this article is to widen the practical use of IDEAL by clarifying the rationale for and practical details of the Recommendations. Additional research based on the experience of implementing these Recommendations is needed to further improve them.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

Strength of the recommendations according to GRADE — category definitions — include strong and conditional ratings for and against, and a no-recommendation option. Strong recommendation for applies when the panel is certain that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects. Conditional recommendation for applies when the panel is less confident that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects. Conditional recommendation against applies when the panel is less confident that the undesirable effects outweigh the desirable effects. Strong recommendation against applies when the panel is certain that the undesirable effects outweigh the desirable effects. No recommendation applies when confidence is very low to make a recommendation or trade-offs are finely balanced or no data are available.

### The R.O. A.D. to precision medicine [^d2b89f15]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, hyperparameter tuning of OPTs, which is the only level in which the user is involved, did not result in drastically different OPTs. In fact, regardless of the differences in the structure (e.g. different variables or different variable cut offs), the OPTs are robust in that their sensitivity and specificity converge. This may mean that some patient characteristics used by the OPTs are surrogates of the outcome of interest and not causally related. However, this does not decrease their practical value as the essence of precision medicine is to find the best match between the available treatments and patient subgroups and not the discovery of causal relationships. Importantly, not only did the sensitivity and specificity of the various OPTs converge, but their combined values exceeded those of current recommendations, which relied on a blend of expert opinion and statistical analysis. Furthermore, the use of sensitivity and specificity is a novel addition as the use of these metrics was previously restricted to validating diagnostic tests only.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^77a6fed7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^61f85497]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D screening in individuals with obesity — recommendation rationale and implementation considerations are as follows: The panel's "conditional recommendation against routine 25(OH)D screening for those with obesity" is based on a lack of clinical trials on screening benefit and treatment selection, uncertainty that potential benefits would offset the "additional burden and costs of 25(OH)D testing," and feasibility concerns for universal screening. The panel "did not identify any studies that adequately addressed the cost-effectiveness, or the potential equity impact" of screening, though it judged screening "would be acceptable to most" and "feasible in many settings" with daily nonprescription supplementation. Given obesity prevalence, including that "the prevalence of obesity in the United States is estimated to be 41.9%," the panel noted that screening all individuals with obesity would require "significant effort and resources" and "may not be feasible from a societal perspective"; the panel was also "uncertain about what 25(OH)D level would necessitate subsequent vitamin D administration."

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^fc35ec7f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine GRADE recommendations — grade 1A, 1B, and 1C definitions and implications are outlined as follows: Grade 1A "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" notes "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa," supported by "Consistent evidence from well-performed randomized, controlled trials or overwhelming evidence of some other form. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of benefit and risk," with implications that "Strong recommendations; can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation" and that "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." Grade 1B "Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" is based on "Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise) or very strong evidence of some other research design. Further research (if performed) is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of benefit and risk and may change the estimate," and its implications state "Strong recommendation and applies to most patients" and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." Grade 1C "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence" states "Benefits seem to outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa," with "Evidence from observational studies, unsystematic clinical experience, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws. Any estimate of effect is uncertain," and the implication is a "Strong recommendation that applies to most patients."

### Paradoxes in leaky microbial trade [^6febe695]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We now consider what happens when two populations of cell types can exchange metabolites (i.e. D > 0). For any initial mixed population, n 1, n 2 > 0, there is a Nash equilibrium choice of production rates where neither organism can improve its growth rate by changing its production. The growth rates of each cell type at this Nash equilibrium are not necessarily the same. If the growth rates are different, then one cell type will increase in relative frequency. This will alter the relative frequencies of the two cell types n 1, n 2 and could lead cell types to adapt to the new frequencies by changing their production. This process continues until either the growth rates of the two cell types are equal and their relative frequencies are stable or one cell type is driven towards extinction (zero frequency). For our choice of growth functions, production constraints, and parameters, there is always a unique stable equilibriumin terms of the relative frequencies of cell types. This means that for a given set of metabolic efficiencies, all mixed populations will approach the same equilibrium of relative frequencies. Of course, a change in the efficiency of producing a metabolite could alter this equilibrium.

We compute the equilibriumas a function of the relative efficiencies of producing metabolites A and B. As before, we hold one cell type, i = 1, fixed in terms of its efficiencies and vary the efficiencies for the other cell type, i = 2. When one cell type is better than the other at both production tasks, the only stable equilibrium is that its fraction of the population approaches one, and the other cell type is driven to extinction (results not shown). This trivial result seemingly contradicts the notion of a comparative advantage, familiar from Ricardian economics, where there is a benefit from trade even if one agent is better at producing all goods. In fact, at a fixed value of the relative frequency 0 < n 1 < 1, a comparative advantage does play a role in setting the Nash equilibrium, and both cell-type populations benefit from the diffusive exchange. However, because cells can reproduce, if one cell type, say 1, is better than the other at both production tasks, it will always grow faster, and any relative frequency except n 1 = 1 will not be sustainable. For the rest of the paper, we ignore this case and consider instead the case where each cell type is more efficient than the other at producing one of the two metabolites.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism [^3a1b63e8]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children — duration of anticoagulation: Pediatric data do not allow estimation of benefits for different treatment durations, as the frequency of major outcomes in children treated for 6 to 12 months compared with > 6 to 12 months cannot be determined accurately, and overall certainty is very low. Extrapolated adult data suggest an advantage for recurrent VTE but many studies' 95% CI contains both an effect and no effect, while adult data suggest no difference in major bleeding risk with the 95% CI containing both an effect and no effect. The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit from using anticoagulation for 6 to 12 months compared with > 6 to 12 months for unprovoked VTE in children, and stated that individual values and preferences of patients and their families should be explored when making this decision. The panel highlighted research needs, including determining mortality, recurrence risk, major bleeding risk, and quality of life outcomes for differing durations in children with unprovoked VTE, and the potential role of serial D-dimers to predict recurrence.

American College of Cardiology emergency department chest pain pathway — applicability and exclusions are as follows: The content applies only to patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia undergoing evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and it does not apply to patients with stable angina or those evaluated in settings other than the ED. This pathway is not applicable to patients with hemodynamic instability, significant heart failure, or other conditions that would mandate hospital admission. The document is focused on the rapid evaluation and disposition of patients with possible ACS in the ED and does not address the evaluation and management of patients with definite ACS or serve as a guide for the diagnosis or management of myocardial infarction (MI).

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation," and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option." Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention," and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

Regarding specific circumstances for osteoporosis in men, more specifically with respect to patients with hypogonadism (laboratory testing), EAA 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain serum total testosterone twice on a morning blood sample. (1, Low) Repeat total testosterone and obtain SHBG if only a single measurement documenting low testosterone is available. Obtain LH and prolactin to better characterize hypogonadism. Do not obtain routine serum estradiol testing. (1, Low) Consider measuring estradiol only when a validated mass spectrometry-based method is available and in rare cases when severe estrogen deficiency is suspected. (2, Low) (Multiple grades) Consider obtaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at baseline in all patients with hypogonadism, irrespective of bone mineral density. (2, Low) Consider obtaining serum calcium (or calcium corrected for albumin when it is applied), phosphorous, and PTH in all patients with hypogonadism with documented low bone mineral density.

Appropriate use definition — applied across technologies and procedures — is described as follows. The document states, "A consistent definition of appropriate use that includes consideration of risks and benefits is applied across technologies and procedures." It defines that "An appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is one in which the expected clinical benefit exceeds the risks of the procedure by a sufficiently wide margin, such that the procedure is generally considered acceptable or reasonable care." For diagnostic imaging, "benefits include incremental information, which when combined with clinical judgment, augments efficient patient care," and "These benefits are weighed against the expected negative consequences (risks include the potential hazard of missed diagnoses, radiation, contrast, and/or unnecessary downstream procedures)." It also notes, "The risks and benefits correspond with the different classes of cardiovascular services."

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1fc85f18]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA level (quality) of evidence — definitions and use: Level A includes "High-quality evidence* from more than 1 RCT," "Meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs," and "One or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies." Level B-R (Randomized) includes "Moderate-quality evidence* from 1 or more RCTs" and "Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs." Level B-NR (Nonrandomized) includes "Moderate-quality evidence* from 1 or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies" and "Meta-analyses of such studies." Level C-LD (Limited Data) includes "Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution," "Meta-analyses of such studies," and "Physiological or mechanistic studies in human subjects." Level C-EO (Expert Opinion) is "Consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience." The framework notes "COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE)," and clarifies that "A recommendation with LOE C does not imply that the recommendation is weak" with justification that "Although RCTs are unavailable, there may be clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective." Additional footnotes specify that "The outcome or result of the intervention should be specified (an improved clinical outcome or increased diagnostic accuracy or incremental prognostic information)," that "†For comparative-effectiveness recommendations (COR 1 and 2a; LOE A and B only), studies that support the use of comparator verbs should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated," and that "‡ The method of assessing quality is evolving, including the application of standardized, widely-used, and preferably validated evidence grading tools; and for systematic reviews, the incorporation of an Evidence Review Committee."

### Moving toward evidence-based practice [^2dc6767e]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

"Evidence-based practice" involves applying the best available evidence to the care of individuals. Explicit, systematic methods have developed for determining what is the best available evidence. However, often even the highest-level evidence is not thoroughly or effectively used in practice, even if it is widely known. We must rigorously and critically analyze study results to understand their strengths, limitations, and generalizability, and bear in mind that our knowledge will evolve and thereby change our practice. The clinical question is not always how to apply the evidence but whether the available evidence applies to a particular patient. We should always ask whether the right provider is doing the right thing for the right patient at the right time in the right setting with the right resources.

### Development and validation of the athletes' rights survey [^d2707fd8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Results

Step 1: rapid literature review and item drafting

In step 1, the literature review yielded no prior instruments testing athletes' understanding of their rights and only two brief, published, publicly available declarations of athletes' rights, introduced above. Thus, categorising rights-related concepts into dimensions of the instrument was straightforward and resulted in a 10-item instrument with items that overlapped only minimally and only when intended by the authors (ie, each knowledge statement had a corresponding attitudes/beliefs statement).

Step 2: item development and face validation

In step 2, 10 athletes completed the first draft survey. Participants used 4–25 min to complete it, with an average of 12 min. All 10 athletes provided written open-ended feedback, and 4 of 10 volunteered to participate in interviews to provide feedback on their experiences of taking the survey. No new issues were identified when comparing athletes' written and verbal feedback.

For the knowledge construct, athletes who were interviewed indicated that the responses to the Rights Construct could be improved by revising to (1) Yes, this is a right of athletes; (2) No, this is not a right of athletes and (3) I do not understand this statement. For the attitudes/beliefs section, all athletes asked that the word 'violence' be separated from the word 'pressure'.In contrast to the language in the WPA and IOC declarations, where the terms are grouped in the same concept (Every athlete is entitled to equality of opportunity in the pursuit of sport without distinction of any kind and free of discrimination, harassment and violence), athletes felt that the meaning of 'violence' was sufficiently different from the meaning of 'pressure,' 'harassment,' 'harm' and other milder terms that were not unanimously negative and that this difference should be reflected in the structure of the attitudes/beliefs construct. Similarly, most athletes suggested using the word 'pressure' instead of 'harassment' to more accurately reflect their experiences.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^ec24e24c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines — economic evidence integration from cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is organized around clinical net benefit; the figure states, "The strength of the recommendation is initially judged on the basis of clinical net benefit," with branches including "Yes (clinical net benefit favors an intervention or is similar between interventions)," "No (intervention has clinical net harm)," and "Uncertain clinical net benefit." For favorable clinical net benefit, when certainty of value is "High or moderate certainty," the potential effect is "↑ Conditional to strong 'for' or ↑ strong to conditional 'for'," whereas with "Low or insufficient certainty" it notes "Meaningful differences in resource utilization (intervention cost) can inform priority of recommended interventions." When there is clinical net harm and CEAs indicate "No value (dominated)" with "High or moderate certainty," the potential effect is "↑ Conditional to strong 'against'," and when certainty is "Low or insufficient certainty" the directive is "Do not further consider economic evidence from CEAs or resource utilization (intervention cost)." For uncertain clinical net benefit with "Low or insufficient certainty," the figure also directs "Do not further consider economic evidence from CEAs or resource utilization (intervention cost)." The figure defines "CEA = cost-effectiveness analysis."

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (leena) [^81a1dfb6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives

A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.36–38A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.22–24A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.39Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.37

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content that produces satisfactory results for the individual. Products containing 50 mcg estrogen should be used only when medically indicated.

e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease

There are three studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives.17, 34, 40In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40–49 years who had used oral contraceptives for 5 or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.17In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.40There is a significantly increased relative risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage after termination of use of oral contraceptives.34However, these studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or higher of estrogen. Products containing 50 mcg estrogen should be used only when medically indicated.

### Strengthening radiopharmacy practice in IAEA member States [^acf13cbf]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Radiopharmaceuticals are essential components of nuclear medicine procedures. Without radiopharmaceuticals nuclear medicine procedures cannot be performed. Therefore it could be said that 'No radiopharmaceutical-no nuclear medicine'.A good radiopharmacy practice supports nuclear medicine activities by producing radiopharmaceuticals that are safe and are of the required quality in a consistent way. As with any medicinal product, radiopharmaceuticals are required to be produced under carefully controlled conditions and are tested for their quality, prior to the administration to patients, using validated standard operating procedures. These procedures are based on the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The GMP principles are based on scientific knowledge and applicable regulatory requirements and guidance related to radiopharmaceutical productions and use. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is committed to promote, in the Member States (MS), a rational and practical approach for the implementation of GMP for compounding or manufacturing of diagnostic or therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. To pursue this goal the IAEA has developed various mechanisms and collaborations with individual experts in the field and with relevant national and international institutions or organizations. IAEA's activities in promoting radiopharmaceutical science include commissioning expert advice in the form of publications on radiopharmaceutical production, quality control and usage, producing technical guidance on production and regulatory aspects related to new radiopharmaceuticals, creating guidance documentation for self or internal audits of radiopharmaceutical production facilities, producing guidance on implementation of Quality Management System and GMP in radiopharmacy, assisting in creation of specific radiopharmaceutical monographs for the International Pharmacopoeia, and developing radiopharmacy-related human resource capabilities in MS through individual and regional training courses and education programs. IAEA strongly supports development of clinical nuclear medicine services by assisting MS in setting up reliable Radiopharmaceutical production facilities for single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and for therapeutic applications.

### Methodology for lung cancer evidence review and guideline development: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^2dfb3fd3]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

ACCP recommendation grades — weak (2A–2C) describe closely balanced benefit–risk scenarios, evidence sources, and implications. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A) applies when "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden," supported by "Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies," and implies "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values" and "Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect." Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B) also has "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden" with "Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies," and implies "Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values" and that "Higher-quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate." Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence (2C) is marked by "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk and burden may be closely balanced," based on "Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence," and implies "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and that "Higher-quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate."

### Sustainability principle for the ethics of healthcare resource allocation [^8a5137d2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

We have three responses. First, note that the objection does not challenge all forms of the sustainability principle listed in the fourth section, but only side constraint and gradual weight. Since these introduce sustainability considerations into specific allocation decisions, they could indeed in certain cases advocate unequal treatment of groups with equally strong claims from the viewpoint of the other operational principles. However, in the forms of rational savings or insurance, sustainability considerations operate independently of such decisions and thus do not compete with standard operational principles in this way. Since these considerations come into play before resources are allocated to patients or interventions, they will not imply unequal allocation in a given allocation round. The objection can thus be sidestepped by having the principle take either of these two forms.

Second, even focusing on side constraint and gradual weight, the unequal treatment involved may not be of a kind that the equal treatment principle, properly understood, rejects. This principle rests on the view that just institutions should not give people unequal prospects based on factors that are, as Rawls(Section 12) puts it, 'arbitrary from a moral point of view'. While Rawls himself had contingencies in the natural and social lotteries in mind, it remains debated just what factors are properly considered morally arbitrary. On one view, any factor outside a person's choice or control is arbitrary. However, this cannot be the view assumed by the equal treatment principle for healthcare resource allocation, since this principle permits prioritising patients with different needs and/or prognosis differently, even though these factors are typically not within people's control. A better suggestion (for present purposes) is the idea that whether some factor is arbitrary depends on the justification of the particular institution in question. For instance, merit is plausibly a non-arbitrary basis for unequal rewards on the labour market but an arbitrary one in the legal system because only the former institution is justified by efficiency considerations. Applying this idea to the case at hand, it seems that sustainability considerations may well qualify as non-arbitrary. Healthcare is plausibly understood to properly aim at mitigating social inequalities, or at least at meeting a population's health needs on equal terms. Functioning in accordance with such a justification over time requires counteracting negative dynamics, for reasons already given. If unequal allocation to patient groups or interventions that other operational principles consider equal is a necessary or effective way of achieving this, then this could be seen as an instance of unequal treatment based on relevant, that is, non-arbitrary, grounds.

### Genetic similarity between relatives provides evidence on the presence and history of assortative mating [^7d7b7060]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Expected genotypic correlations in the nuclear family

In Fig. 1, there is only one valid chain between partners' additive genetic factors (e.g.↔): The genotypic correlation between partners (denoted) is thus the phenotypic correlation attributable to assortative mating, weighted by the trait's heritability,:

Similarly, we can trace the valid chains between the additive genetic factors of a parent and their offspring (e.g.↔). There are two valid chains: one directly from parental genetic factors to offspring genetic factors, and one through the other parent via the assorted phenotype: The genotypic correlation between parent and offspring is therefore. With no assortative mating, this reduces to. For siblings (↔), there are four valid chains: which can be rearranged so that it equals the genotypic parent-offspring correlation. Because they are equal, we can define a common denotation for first-degree relatives. We can also substitutewithgiving us:

ACC/AHA level (quality) of evidence — definitions and pairing rules are outlined as follows: Level A includes "High-quality evidence‡ from more than 1 RCTs," "Meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs," or "One or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies." Level B-R (Randomized) includes "Moderate-quality evidence‡ from 1 or more RCTs" or "Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs." Level B-NR (Nonrandomized) includes "Moderate-quality evidence‡ from 1 or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies" or "Meta-analyses of such studies." Level C includes "Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution," "Meta-analyses of such studies," or "Physiological or mechanistic studies in human subjects." Level E is "Consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience when evidence is insufficient, vague, or conflicting." Pairing guidance states "COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE)" and clarifies that "A recommendation with LOE C or E does not imply that the recommendation is weak"; additional notes specify "The outcome or result of the intervention should be specified" and for comparative-effectiveness recommendations "studies that support the use of comparator words should involve direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated."

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^7e69974f]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable," with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)," implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak," with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action," implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role."

### No frugal innovation without frugal evaluation: the global IDEAL sub-framework [^6ff711b3]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Experience of evaluating innovation

The majority (n = 48; 72.7%) had experience in clinical research with patients, and the remaining either had experience with preclinical research (n = 15; 22.7%) or had no prior experience (n = 15; 22.7%) (respondents could select more than one option). The spread of evaluation experience mapped against IDEAL stages is shown in figure 2, with the majority having experience in IDEAL stage 2 studies. The conduct of IDEAL stage 1 studies was relatively uncommon. The majority (n = 48; 72.8%) of participants felt that conducting this study design in LMICs was realistic in their experience. Most participants felt that conducting IDEAL stage 2a and 2b studies was realistic in their experience (n = 51; 77.3% and n = 44; 66.7%, respectively). For IDEAL stage 3 studies, over half (n = 35; 53%) felt this design was realistic in their setting. Finally, 48 (72.7%) of participants felt IDEAL stage 4 studies were realistic in their setting.

Figure 2
The number of respondents who have undertaken a study at each IDEAL stage (short descriptors were used to describe the IDEAL stages). IDEAL, Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study.

Most (n = 49; 74.2%) had experience evaluating surgical technologies. Respondents reported that technologies and innovations were most frequently adopted either based on colleague recommendation or on clinical evaluation in countries other than their own (figure 3). Almost half (n = 30; 45.4%) of respondents perceived the need for evidence from a locally conducted RCT before adopting a technology/innovation that is in established use in a context other than their own (figure 4).

Figure 4
Respondents' perceptions around evidence required from local studies before adopting a technology/innovation in established use in a context other than their own. Stage 0 refers to preclinical studies; stage 1 focuses on a small number of participants; stage 2 is split into 2a and 2b. Stage 2a includes a small number of selected participants in a single group design, stage 2b builds on this using prospective cohort studies and feasibility randomized controlled trials. Stage 3 seeks definitive comparative evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness; stage 4 takes the form of long-term surveillance studies.

### Good or best practice statements: proposal for the operationalisation and implementation of GRADE guidance [^3074ff53]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Construct a statement that is clear and actionable

A GPS should be constructed as any recommendation is framed and expressed in actionable terms with the intended intervention, population and setting clearly specified. In the presentation of the GPS, guideline developers should ensure that users are not confused with formally graded recommendations and follow the suggestions made by the GRADE Working Group, using a separate heading for GPS or adding 'ungraded' next to the statement. However, an important concept in the operationalisation of the guidance is to separate the evaluation of a GPS (answering the question of if the statement is clear and actionable) from the actual development of a GPS. A guideline panel should clearly define the population, interventions and comparator that are the subject of the actionable statement, as they would do for a formal recommendation.

### Efficacy assessment in phase I clinical trials: endpoints and challenges [^164be510]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The scope of phase I clinical trials in oncology goes beyond the conventional safety evaluation-only objectives of these trials in other specialties. Rather, most first-in-human oncology clinical trials have therapeutic intent, and efficacy signals observed in phase I trials can drive a go/no-go decision of advancing a new molecule to phase II testing. The complexity of efficacy assessment in the context of a small, heterogeneous patient population and a complex study design requires a more liberal perspective compared with later trial phases when looking into efficacy endpoints. Classically, in later-phase clinical trials, these endpoints would include the objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. However, new, evolving endpoints may be worth investigating when looking into the antitumor activity signals in phase I trials. Integration of all these endpoints into trial designs can improve the assessment of therapeutic efficacy during early drug development and guide decisions related to the further advancement of novel molecules into later phases. In this review, we discuss the advantages and pitfalls of different classic efficacy endpoints when evaluated as part of phase I trials in oncology and describe how challenges in assessing the antitumor activity of new drugs can be overcome through the incorporation of novel endpoints that have thus far proven successful in clinical trials.

Prevention funding and incentive realignment — policy context — emphasizes that "Today's federal programs pay minimal attention to prevention health services" and that "Public and private investment in sick care (especially low-leverage and end-of-life care) should not be allowed to crowd out higher-leverage investments in prevention that can produce more social benefit for the same cost." It calls for parity by stating "There should be parity in the funding of high value evidence-based preventive services in both public and private programs," and notes that certain benefit designs "actually create disincentives to healing and healthful behavior."

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^70fe3a90]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline development — NICE "produces clinical guidelines and guidance on public health and health technologies for the National Health Service in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland" and commissions "4 external centers and an internal center" to produce them. The National Clinical Guideline Centre is "the largest of these centers; it was established in 2009 from a merger of 4 smaller guideline-producing centers," alongside "the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, the National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health." NICE "has been publishing clinical guidelines since 2001, and more than 100 guidelines have been completed," with methods "fundamentally focused on providing clear recommendations that are based on the best available evidence" and based on "review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments and, for some guidelines, diagnostic and prognostic evidence, to support clinical decision making." Method standards are described in "The Guidelines Manual 2009 (1)," with the exception that "For guidelines for which the scoping process started before 5 January 2009, the 2007 version of the guidelines manual applies (2)," and quality is assessed using "The AGREE instrument (3)… to assess the quality of clinical guideline development process and reporting." Topic generation and scoping involve broad engagement: suggestions come "from diverse sources, including health care professionals, patients, carers, the general public, and the Department of Health or the Welsh Assembly Government"; "National panels then formally prioritize these topics" and "ministers at the Department of Health sign off on which topics should have guidelines commissioned"; selection considers "the burden of disease, the impact on resources, the importance of policy, whether there is inappropriate variation in practice across the country, and factors that affect the timeliness of or urgency for guidance to be produced"; subsequently, "NICE refers each topic to the appropriate guideline developing center" and "The center then develops a scope for each guideline."

### The continuum of comparability extends to biosimilarity: how much is enough and what clinical data are necessary? [^2245c3dd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Experts debate the clinical evidence standards needed to approve major manufacturing changes for biologics, biosimilars, and interchangeable biosimilars. As sponsors consider their development plans, the resource investment required to develop an analytically highly similar candidate must be balanced by regulatory relief for the clinical studies required to achieve the necessary indications for the marketed product. This article discusses biosimilarity and comparability as related scientific and regulatory concepts and the usefulness of clinical data for both.

### On the future of guidelines [^413ef436]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

"GRADE is an excellent way to exhaust all the volunteers on the guideline committee but probably will not help much in putting together the final recommendations.", exclaimed a respected intensivist during a clinical practice guideline panel meeting. The remark underscored how guideline development is often slow and resource intensive. Yet, on reflection, most people acknowledge that the benefits of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach have been remarkable, and its influence on evidence-based medicine and daily clinical practice remains central. This forward-looking comment on the evolving landscape of clinical practice guideline development highlights both challenges and opportunities, beginning with a comparison of guideline formats, and followed by emerging approaches to evidence appraisal.

### Hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (Engerix-B) [^8c4b3e5b]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ENGERIX-B is indicated for immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. As hepatitis D (caused by the delta virus) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection, it can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by ENGERIX-B vaccination.

ENGERIX-B will not prevent hepatitis caused by other agents, such as hepatitis A, C, and E viruses, or other pathogens known to infect the liver.

Immunization is recommended in persons of all ages, especially those who are, or will be, at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus,1for example:

Infants, Including Those Born of HBsAg-Positive Mothers (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
Adolescents (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
Healthcare Personnel: Dentists and oral surgeons. Dental, medical, and nursing students. Physicians, surgeons, and podiatrists. Nurses. Paramedical and ambulance personnel and custodial staff who may be exposed to the virus via blood or other patient specimens. Dental hygienists and dental nurses. Laboratory and blood bank personnel handling blood, blood products, and other patient specimens. Hospital cleaning staff who handle waste.
Selected Patients and Patient Contacts: Patients and staff in hemodialysis units and hematology/oncology units. Patients requiring frequent and/or large volume blood transfusions or clotting factor concentrates (e.g., persons with hemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, cirrhosis). Clients (residents) and staff of institutions for the mentally handicapped. Classroom contacts of deinstitutionalized mentally handicapped persons who have persistent hepatitis B surface antigenemia and who show aggressive behavior. Household and other intimate contacts of persons with persistent hepatitis B surface antigenemia.
Subpopulations With a Known High Incidence of the Disease, such as: Alaskan Eskimos. Pacific Islanders. Indochinese immigrants. Haitian immigrants. Refugees from other HBV-endemic areas. All infants of women born in areas where the infection is highly endemic.
Individuals With Chronic Hepatitis C: Risk factors for hepatitis C are similar to those for hepatitis B. Consequently, immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for individuals with chronic hepatitis C.
Persons Who May Be Exposed to the Hepatitis B Virus by Travel to High-Risk Areas (See ACIP Guidelines, 1990.)
Military Personnel Identified as Being at Increased Risk
Morticians and Embalmers
Persons at Increased Risk of the Disease Due to Their Sexual Practices,1,16such as: Persons with more than 1 sexual partner in a 6-month period. Persons who have contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Homosexually active males. Female prostitutes.
Prisoners
Users of Illicit Injectable Drugs
Others: Police and fire department personnel who render first aid or medical assistance, and any others who, through their work or personal life-style, may be exposed to the hepatitis B virus. Adoptees from countries of high HBV endemicity.

An EUA is a FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) in the United States under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when the Secretary of HHS declares that there is a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves biological agent(s) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s). Criteria for issuing an EUA include:

The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that
the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
the known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s);
There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

Actinic keratosis guideline — strength of recommendations and implications are defined as follows: Strong recommendation for the use of an intervention uses the wording "We recommend" and implies "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens; recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances." Conditional recommendation for the use of an intervention uses "We conditionally recommend" and implies "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden; recommendation applies to most patients, but most appropriate action may differ, depending on the patient or other stakeholder values." Strong recommendation against the use of an intervention uses "We recommend against" with the implication "Risk and burden clearly outweigh benefits; recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances." Conditional recommendation against the use of an intervention uses "We conditionally recommend against" with the implication "Risks and burden closely balance with benefits; recommendation applies to most patients, but most appropriate action may differ, depending on the patient or other stakeholder values." A Good Practice Statement uses "We recommend" when "Guidance was viewed by the Work Group as imperative to clinical practice and developed when the supporting evidence was considerable but indirect and the certainty surrounding the intervention's impact was high, with the benefits clearly outweighing the harms (or vice versa)," and "Good Practice Statements are strong recommendations, as the certainty surrounding the impact of the recommended intervention is high. Implementation of these strong recommendations is considered to clearly result in beneficial outcomes."

In Steps 1–2, low-dose ICS-formoterol is used as needed and "reduces the risk of severe exacerbations and ED visits/hospitalizations by 65% compared with SABA alone, and reduces ED visits/hospitalizations by 37%, compared with daily ICS plus as-needed SABA." In Steps 3–5 (MART), ICS-formoterol "reduces the risk of severe exacerbations by 32% compared with the same dose of ICS-LABA, by 23% compared with a higher dose of ICS-LABA, and by 17% compared with usual care," and "MART is also an option for children 6–11 years in Steps 3–4." Additional notes state this step-up/step-down flexibility "cannot be done with any other ICS-LABA" and that "ICS-formoterol can also be used before exercise and before allergen exposure."
