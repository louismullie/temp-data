## Question

1. Solution. First, consider some fixed vertical order of laying the glasses (from bottom to top). It is clear that by rotating the entire layout by some angle, we will not change the layout (we will not get a new layout). Therefore, we can assume that the bottom glass in the layout is always fixed (does not rotate). Then different layouts (with a fixed vertical order of glasses) will differ from each other by the rotation of each of the subsequent 4 upper glasses by 0°, 120°, and 240° relative to the fixed bottom glass. Therefore, we will get a total of 3⁴ = 81 layout options with a fixed vertical order of glasses. Taking into account all possible vertical permutations of the five glasses (5! = 120 options), we get the total number of possible glass layouts in a stack: 5! 3⁴ = 120 × 81 = 9720 pieces. But not all these layouts meet the condition of the problem. The condition of the problem is satisfied by all layouts except those in which the entire stack turns out to be completely vertically opaque. Let's first find the number of such layouts.

For this, consider columns of isosceles triangles (parts located above each of the three fixed isosceles triangles of the bottom glass). Let's determine the number of such layouts in which each of these four columns is opaque. One of these columns is already opaque by default (the one standing on the bottom shaded isosceles triangle). Consider the ordered set (vector) of possible rotation angles (for definiteness, clockwise) of the shaded isosceles triangles on each of the 4 upper glasses relative to the bottom shaded equilateral triangle: (α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄), where αₖ ∈ {0°, 120°, 240°}, k = 1,2,3,4.

All "columns" of glass isosceles triangles will be opaque if this set of rotation angles necessarily includes at least one 120° and at least one 240° (while the angle 0° is not required to appear, although it will not hurt if it does appear). The other two places in the set can be occupied by any of the three possible values {0°, 120°, 240°}, i.e., 0° and 120°, or 0° and 240°, or 120° and 240°, as well as 0° and 0°, or 120° and 120°, or 240° and 240°. Therefore, to count the total number of such sets (and thus the number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses), we will divide them into the following six groups:

- If the two additional values are 0° and 120°, then we get sets in which the rotation angles 0° and 240° appear once, and the angle 120° appears twice. The total number of such sets (due to permutations) will be 6 × 2 = 12 (here 6 is the number of ways to choose places in the vector for two angles of 120°, and 2 is the number of ways to permute the angles 0° and 240° in the two remaining places);
- If the two additional values are 0° and 240°, then we get sets in which the rotation angles 0° and 120° appear once, and the angle 240° appears twice. Analogously to the previous case, the total number of such sets (due to permutations) will be 6 × 2 = 12;
- If the two additional values are 120° and 240°, then we get sets in which the rotation angles 120° and 240° appear twice each. The total number of such sets (due to permutations) will be 6 × 1 = 6 (here 6 is the number of ways to choose two places out of four for placing two angles of 120°, and 1 is the only way to place two angles of 240° in the two remaining places);
- If the two additional values are 0° and 0°, then we get sets in which the rotation angles 120° and 240° appear once, and the angle 0° appears twice. The total number of such sets (due to permutations) will be 6 × 2 = 12 (here 6 is the number of ways to choose two places out of four for placing two angles of 0°, and 2 is the number of ways to permute the angles 120° and 240° in the two remaining places);
- If the two additional values are 120° and 120°, then we get sets in which the rotation angle 240° appears once, and the angle 120° appears three times. The total number of such sets will be 4 × 1 = 4 (here 4 is the number of ways to choose one place out of four for placing the angle 240°, and 1 is the only way to place the identical angles 120° in the three remaining places);
- If the two additional values are 240° and 240°, then we get sets in which the rotation angle 120° appears once, and the angle 240° appears three times. Analogously to the previous case, the total number of such sets will be 4 × 1 = 4.

In the end, we get a total of 12+12+6+12+4+4 = 50 ordered sets of rotation angles that satisfy the required condition. This is the total number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses in which the final stack turns out to be opaque. By permuting the glasses (in the vertical direction) in 5! = 120 ways, we get the total number of 120 × 50 = 6000 layouts in which the final stack turns out to be opaque. Finally, by subtracting the number of 6000 unwanted layouts from the total number of different layouts 9720, we finally get 9720–6000 = 3720 ways to lay out a partially transparent stack of five glasses.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to count the number of valid glass-stack arrangements where the stack remains at least partially transparent, given that each glass can be rotated to 0°, 120°, or 240° and that the stack is opaque only if every vertical column through the shaded isosceles triangles is blocked. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of arrangements without any transparency constraint. Then, I should verify the condition that makes a stack fully opaque. Next, I will count the opaque arrangements using inclusion–exclusion or a direct case-based approach. Finally, I will subtract to get the number of partially transparent stacks and sanity-check the arithmetic.

> Let me first confirm the total state space. With 5 distinct glasses and 3 possible rotations for each of the 4 upper glasses (fixing the bottom glass's orientation to avoid rotational duplicates), the total number of distinct arrangements is 5! × 3⁴ = 120 × 81 = 9720, which matches the initial calculation.

> Now, I need to check what makes a stack fully opaque. The stack is opaque when, for each of the three angular columns defined by the bottom glass's shaded triangles, every position upward through that column is blocked by a shaded triangle on some glass. Wait, let me verify the column logic: the bottom glass's shaded triangles define three fixed columns, and a column is blocked if, for every level above the bottom, at least one glass in that column has its shaded triangle aligned to that column. So, the stack is opaque iff all three columns are blocked in this way.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about counting opaque arrangements. I initially thought to use inclusion–exclusion over the three columns, but that gets messy because the columns are not independent in terms of which rotation angles satisfy blocking. Let me reconsider and use the direct case-based approach from the original solution, which enumerates valid rotation vectors for the four upper glasses that ensure each column is blocked, then multiplies by permutations of the glasses.

> I will now examine the rotation vectors for the four upper glasses. For a fixed vertical ordering, the stack is opaque iff, across the four upper glasses, the set of rotations includes at least one 120° and at least one 240° relative to the bottom glass's reference orientation. This ensures that every column will be blocked somewhere above the bottom glass. Let me double-check that this condition is both necessary and sufficient for full opacity before proceeding.

> Next, I should review the case-based counting of rotation vectors. The original solution partitions the 4-tuples by how many 0°, 120°, and 240° angles appear, ensuring at least one 120° and one 240°. Let me verify the counts: (2×120°, 1×0°, 1×240°) gives C(4,2)×2! = 6×2 = 12; (2×240°, 1×0°, 1×120°) gives the same 12; (2×120°, 2×240°) gives C(4,2)×1 = 6; (2×0°, 1×120°, 1×240°) gives C(4,2)×2! = 6×2 = 12; (3×120°, 1×240°) gives C(4,1) = 4; and (3×240°, 1×120°) gives C(4,1) = 4. Summing these yields 12 + 12 + 6 + 12 + 4 + 4 = 50 valid rotation vectors for the upper four glasses that make the stack opaque, which aligns with the original computation.

> But wait, what if I misclassified a case? Let me verify the logic again: each of these 50 vectors guarantees that both 120° and 240° appear at least once among the four upper glasses, which by the column-blocking rule makes all three columns opaque. Conversely, any vector missing 120° or missing 240° would leave at least one column unblocked, so the count is correct for fixed vertical order.

> Next, I should review how permutations enter. For each of the 50 rotation patterns, the five distinct glasses can be stacked in 5! = 120 different vertical orders. Thus, the total number of fully opaque arrangements is 50 × 120 = 6000, which matches the subtraction target.

> Finally, I will subtract to get the answer. The number of partially transparent stacks equals total arrangements minus opaque arrangements: 9720 − 6000 = 3720. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 9720 − 6000 is indeed 3720, so the final count is 3720 valid arrangements.

---

The number of ways to stack five glasses with **partial transparency** is **3,720**. This is found by subtracting the 6,000 fully opaque arrangements from the 9,720 total possible arrangements. The total is 5! × 3⁴ = 9,720, and the opaque count is 5! × 50 = 6,000, where 50 is the number of rotation sets for the upper four glasses that block all three columns.

---

## Total number of arrangements

Each glass has three rotational positions (0°, 120°, 240°), and the bottom glass is fixed to avoid rotational duplicates, so the upper four glasses have 3⁴ = 81 rotation combinations. With 5! = 120 vertical permutations, the total is **5! × 3⁴ = 120 × 81 = 9,720** arrangements.

---

## Fully opaque arrangements

A stack is fully opaque when each of the three columns (above the bottom glass's shaded triangles) is blocked at every level. This requires that, among the four upper glasses, both 120° and 240° rotations appear at least once, ensuring every column is covered. The number of such rotation sets is **50**, so the opaque count is **5! × 50 = 120 × 50 = 6,000**.

---

## Partially transparent arrangements

Subtracting the fully opaque arrangements from the total gives the partially transparent arrangements: **9,720 − 6,000 = 3,720**.

---

The final answer is **3,720** ways to stack the glasses with partial transparency.

Nuclear density distributions for several 12 C states using the SU(4) interaction.

a – f Results for the density distribution of the two inner angles of the triangle formed by the three alpha clusters for the, states respectively. The two axes are for the two inner angles θ 1 and θ 2 measured in degrees. g – l Results for the two-dimensional projection of the nuclear density for the, states respectively. In each case the orientation of the shortest root-mean-square direction is aligned with the x axis.

We now define a model-independent two-dimensional projection of the nuclear density for the states of 12 C. In order to construct this projection, we first identify the x axis as the direction with the smallest RMS deviation of the nucleon positions relative to the center of mass. For the nuclear states that we have already identified as having an equilateral triangular shape, we rotate the density configurations along the x axis so that one of the three clusters is pointing along the positive z direction. We then symmetrize with respect to 0°, 120° and 240° rotations about the x axis. For nuclear states that we have already identified as having an obtuse isosceles shape, we identify the z axis as the direction with the longest RMS deviation of the nucleon positions relative to the CM. We then rotate the density configurations along the z axis so that the alpha cluster closest to the CM lies on the positive y axis.

In the right panel of Fig. 2, we show the density distribution of selected states of 12 C for the SU(4) interaction. The density distributions obtained using the N2LO chiral interaction are presented in Fig. 3 and the Supplementary Information and are in excellent agreement with the SU(4) interaction results. The, andstates (see Supplementary Information for the last two) have similar intrinsic equilateral triangular shapes, consistent with an interpretation as members of a rotational band built on top of thestate. The, states (see Supplementary Information for the last one) have similar intrinsic obtuse isosceles triangle shapes and are consistent with belonging to a rotational band built on top of thestate. These findings are consistent with previous studies in the literature based on group theoretical considerations. We note that models where the Hoyle state has an equilateral triangle symmetry predict an additional 3⁻ and 4⁻ state in the Hoyle state rotational band.

### Super-wide-field two-photon imaging with a micro-optical device moving in post-objective space [^8c72c1e6]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The procedure for imaging two target regions was as follows. First, the relative coordinates of the two regions in the horizontal direction were measured using an epifluorescence image with a low magnification objective (LMPlanFl, ×5; Olympus) or by moving an XY stage from the center of one region to that of the other. By solving a simple trigonometric equation, the rotation angles for imaging of the two target regions were determined. It is necessary to avoid putting the dental cement on the portion of the skull below which the center of the donut shape may be set. After setting the angle of the rotation mount to one target region, the FOV was moved to the center of the target region. Parallelism between the mirror holder and glass window was important. For example, when a large glass window of 8 mm (used in Fig. 4) is set at a 5° tilt relative to the horizontal plane, d m–c at the edge of the glass at the bottom side is 0.7 mm longer than at the edge of the glass at the top side. This extension to d m–c decreases d o–m, so that the beam entering and passing through the mirrors, and therefore also the spatial resolution, is decreased. Thus, the mirror holder and glass window should be kept parallel as much as possible to maintain them in close proximity. After the bottom of the mirror holder and the glass window were placed as close as possible, images were acquired while the timings of rotation, imaging, and piezo movements were controlled by a program written with LabVIEW.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Unusual fast secondary relaxation in metallic glass [^77a2267a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Since the ancient times, glass has been an important engineering material that was used by humans in tools making. Today, there are many kinds of glasses, natural or man-made, which are widely employed in different engineering applications, such as oxide glass for optics, polymeric glass for biotechnology, colloidal glass for medicine, and silicon glass for electronics. Despite the importance of the glassy materials, however, their structure has been remaining a longstanding problem in materials science and condensed matter physics. From the structural viewpoint, glassy materials possess no long-range translational symmetry, hence defying the use of conventional tools for a thorough structural understanding. From the viewpoint of structural dynamic heterogeneity, glassy materials contain regions of different relaxation times, which could give rise to different relaxation spectra on external agitation. Therefore, the relaxation behaviour of glassy materials is very important, which can shed light on the hidden dynamic structural features and holds the key to the understanding of the different phenomena observed in the glass science, such as deformation, diffusion and glass transition.

### Accessing ultrastable glass via a bulk transformation [^00e9681c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As a medium to understand the nature of glass transition, ultrastable glasses have garnered increasing attention for their significance in fundamental science and technological applications. Most studies have produced ultrastable glasses through a surface-controlled process using physical vapor deposition. Here, we demonstrate an approach to accessing ultrastable glasses via the glass-to-glass transition, a bulk transformation that is inherently free from size constraints and anisotropy. The resulting ultrastable glass exhibits a significantly enhanced density (improved by 2.3%), along with high thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical stability. Furthermore, we propose that this method of accessing ultrastable glasses is general for metallic glasses, based on the examination of the competitive relationship between the glass-to-glass transition and crystallization. This strategy is expected to facilitate the proliferation of the ultrastable glass family, helping to resolve the instability issues of glass materials and devices and deepen our understanding of glasses and the glass transition.

### Ultrastable metallic glasses formed on cold substrates [^904bf583]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Vitrification from physical vapor deposition is known to be an efficient way for tuning the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of glasses and significantly improve their properties. There is a general consensus that preparing stable glasses requires the use of high substrate temperatures close to the glass transition one, T g. Here, we challenge this empirical rule by showing the formation of Zr-based ultrastable metallic glasses (MGs) at room temperature, i.e., with a substrate temperature of only 0.43T g. By carefully controlling the deposition rate, we can improve the stability of the obtained glasses to higher values. In contrast to conventional quenched glasses, the ultrastable MGs exhibit a large increase of T g of ∼60K, stronger resistance against crystallization, and more homogeneous structure with less order at longer distances. Our study circumvents the limitation of substrate temperature for developing ultrastable glasses, and provides deeper insight into glasses stability and their surface dynamics.

The twist angles measured by a dashed line and dashed circle in f are consistent with the macroscopic stacking angles. Insets in g are the relative intensities of the first-order and second-order SEAD spots, the purple and cyan lines represent the intensity profiles of the double-layer graphene with the twist angle of ~0° and the other monolayer graphene, respectively.

To further demonstrate the controllability and repeatability of the macroscopic stacking angle, we have also transferred a wafer-scale triple-layer graphene with designed twist angles. As shown in Fig. 4b, we first use a double-layer graphene with stacking angle α 1 of ~20° as the bottom block and then immerse it into the aqueous solution. One wafer flat of bottom double-layer graphene is rotated in a specific orientation, which is usually parallel to a ruler. After that, we need to rotate the third floating graphene film and adjust another macroscopic stacking angle α 2 to 0° before being fixed with support (Fig. 4c). This is similar to the operation in supplementary Fig. 11b-c. The solution is then slowly exhausted to descend the floating graphene, resulting in an initial alignment of the bottom block (Fig. 4d). Next, the fixers are removed and the solution between the graphene layers is also eliminated with the spinning-assisted transfer method. Figure 4e shows the stacked triple-layer graphene after the spinning process, and the macroscopic stacking angle remains unchanged at ~0° and ~20°.

### Creating bulk ultrastable glasses by random particle bonding [^2752d18c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A recent breakthrough in glass science has been the synthesis of ultrastable glasses via physical vapor deposition techniques. These samples display enhanced thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical stability, with important implications for fundamental science and technological applications. However, the vapor deposition technique is limited to atomic, polymer and organic glass-formers and is only able to produce thin film samples. Here, we propose a novel approach to generate ultrastable glassy configurations in the bulk, via random particle bonding, and using computer simulations we show that this method does indeed allow for the production of ultrastable glasses. Our technique is in principle applicable to any molecular or soft matter system, such as colloidal particles with tunable bonding interactions, thus opening the way to the design of a large class of ultrastable glasses.

### Ferroelectric columnar assemblies from the bowl-to-bowl inversion of aromatic cores [^f660b99f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The second important molecular motion is a relative skew rotation of C1SS dimer, where the rotation angle of the upper C1SS relative to the lower one changed the magnitude of the relative energy at fixed bowl-shaped conformation with the fixed torsion angle of 175° (Fig. 8b). When the bowl-shaped C1SS dimer was directly overlapped with a translational motion along the π-dimer with the sterically repulsive S–S interactions along the π-stack, a large relative energy around 30 kcal mol⁻¹ was observed as a forbidden in-plane free rotational motion. The energy minima for the skew angle rotation were observed at the angles of 30° and 90° with every 60° rotation of the upper C1SS, while the maxima of the dipole moment of 0.84 D were also observed around 20 and 100°. The forbidden in-plane free rotation inhibited the formation of Col h liquid crystal phase. The restricted 30°-rotated π-stacking interaction of C1SS in the π-stacking column was also thermally fluctuated in the high-temperature viscous S2 phase, where the motion was also coupled with the inversion motion of bowl-shaped conformation via the π-planar one (Fig. 8c). Although the π-stacking distance in the π-dimer (C1SS) 2 was associated with the relative energy, it did not affect the theoretical dipole moment (Supplementary Fig. 15). Three kinds of motional freedoms of torsion, skew, and dimer separation distance were activated at S2 phase, among which the first two coupled to generate the macroscale dipole moment under the applied electric field (Fig. 8d). When the electric field was applied to the thermally fluctuated π-stacking column of (C n SS) ∞, the polarized molecular conformation in the 1D assembly should be stabilized at the bowl-shaped and twisted π-stacking columnar structure keeping the maximum dipole structure. Such polar molecular assembly was thermally relaxed after the removal of the outer electric field, which resulted in the ferroelectric P - E hysteresis and relaxation behavior at high-temperature viscous S2 phase. In the order-disorder type molecular ferroelectrics, the low-frequency response at f = 0.1–10 Hz has been typically observed in the P - E hysteresis curve. However, the relatively high-frequency responses of the P - E hysteresis curve at f = 100–200 Hz for C n SS derivatives were consistent with the structural relaxation process from the polar molecular assembly structure under the applied electric field.

### Dolutegravir sodium (tivicay) [^27dc13ad]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

An observational study showed an association between TIVICAY and an increased risk of neural tube defects when TIVICAY was administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. As there is limited understanding of reported types of neural tube defects associated with dolutegravir use and because the date of conception may not be determined with precision, an alternative treatment to TIVICAY should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Perform pregnancy testing before initiation of dolutegravir in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to exclude use of dolutegravir during the first trimester of pregnancy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Initiation of dolutegravir is not recommended in adolescents and adults actively trying to become pregnant unless there is no suitable alternative [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Counsel adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to consistently use effective contraception [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

In adolescents and adults of childbearing potential currently on dolutegravir who are actively trying to become pregnant, or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester, assess the risks and benefits of continuing dolutegravir versus switching to another antiretroviral regimen and consider switching to an alternative regimen [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Dolutegravir may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the pregnant woman and the fetus.

5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)]:

Loss of therapeutic effect of TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD and possible development of resistance.
Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs.

For concomitant drugs for which the interaction can be mitigated, please see Table 8 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; review concomitant medications during therapy with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.

### The effect of smart glasses combined with ultrasound on radial arterial catheterization: a randomized controlled trial [^7423b6d3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the success rate of the first puncture of the radial artery catheter, defined as a single skin puncture with successful placement of an arterial catheter, which was subsequently verified through a displayed waveform of invasive blood pressure on the cardiac monitor.

Secondary outcomes considered in the study were as follows: (1) Hand-eye coordination: include head rotations (defined as head movement greater than 45 degrees, including flexion or rotation), ultrasound probe repositioning (defined as moving the ultrasound probe to recapture the needle or target blood vessel), and number of needle redirections (defined as instances where the operator withdraws the needle, redirects it, or advances it at a different angle). (2) Overall success rate: defined as no more than 3 successful skin piercings in selected radial artery. (3) Overall number of attempts: defined as cumulative count of radial artery puncture. (4) Ultrasonic localization time: defined as the duration from when the ultrasound probe is positioned until the initial skin puncture. (5) Catheterization time: defined as the time interval from the initial skin puncture to the emergence of the invasive blood pressure waveform, independent of the number of arterial catheterizations. (6) The radial artery's diameter (defined as the inner diameter) and the radial artery's depth (defined as the vertical distance of the front wall from the surface of the skin). (7) Overall complication rate: include hematoma (defined as low echo area around blood vessel detected on ultrasound), vasospasm (defined as reduction of blood vessel diameter by more than 25% after intubation), artery thrombosis (defined as abnormal echo in blood vessel detected on ultrasound or abnormal circulation at the end of hand), and Catheter malfunction (defined as the inability to monitor or obtain samples despite catheter flushing or changing the dressing). (8) In order to evaluate the degree of musculoskeletal fatigue and operator satisfaction during operation, we assessed operator's satisfaction (100 = most satisfied; 0 = dissatisfied) and levels of difficulty (easy, moderate, and difficult) by means of a visual analog scale (VAS). The scale used an unscaled 10-cm long ruler.

### Surface melting of a colloidal glass [^85dc17e8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Despite their technological relevance, a full microscopic understanding of glasses is still lacking. This applies even more to their surfaces whose properties largely differ from that of the bulk material. Here, we experimentally investigate the surface of a two-dimensional glass as a function of the effective temperature. To yield a free surface, we use an attractive colloidal suspension of micron-sized particles interacting via tunable critical Casimir forces. Similar to crystals, we observe surface melting of the glass, i.e., the formation of a liquid film at the surface well below the glass temperature. Underneath, however, we find an unexpected region with bulk density but much faster particle dynamics. It results from connected clusters of highly mobile particles which are formed near the surface and deeply percolate into the underlying material. Because its thickness can reach several tens of particle diameters, this layer may elucidate the poorly understood properties of thin glassy films which find use in many technical applications.

### Three-dimensional printing of photonic colloidal glasses into objects with isotropic structural color [^aa447cf5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Structural color is frequently exploited by living organisms for biological functions and has also been translated into synthetic materials as a more durable and less hazardous alternative to conventional pigments. Additive manufacturing approaches were recently exploited for the fabrication of exquisite photonic objects, but the angle-dependence observed limits a broader application of structural color in synthetic systems. Here, we propose a manufacturing platform for the 3D printing of complex-shaped objects that display isotropic structural color generated from photonic colloidal glasses. Structurally colored objects are printed from aqueous colloidal inks containing monodisperse silica particles, carbon black, and a gel-forming copolymer. Rheology and Small-Angle-X-Ray-Scattering measurements are performed to identify the processing conditions leading to printed objects with tunable structural colors. Multimaterial printing is eventually used to create complex-shaped objects with multiple structural colors using silica and carbon as abundant and sustainable building blocks.

### Connecting glass-forming ability of binary mixtures of soft particles to equilibrium melting temperatures [^d54334f6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The glass-forming ability is an important material property for manufacturing glasses and understanding the long-standing glass transition problem. Because of the nonequilibrium nature, it is difficult to develop the theory for it. Here we report that the glass-forming ability of binary mixtures of soft particles is related to the equilibrium melting temperatures. Due to the distinction in particle size or stiffness, the two components in a mixture effectively feel different melting temperatures, leading to a melting temperature gap. By varying the particle size, stiffness, and composition over a wide range of pressures, we establish a comprehensive picture for the glass-forming ability, based on our finding of the direct link between the glass-forming ability and the melting temperature gap. Our study reveals and explains the pressure and interaction dependence of the glass-forming ability of model glass-formers, and suggests strategies to optimize the glass-forming ability via the manipulation of particle interactions.

### Evaluating stereoacuity with 3D shutter glasses technology [^c00b1a63]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Stereopsis is the ability to precisely judge distance, and its classification is rather complicated, depending on different definitions, such as fine and coarse, or local and global. With the development of information technology, 3D displays can be driven by computers. Thus a 3D polarization technique was used to evaluate stereopsis, as described by Kim & Yang et al. who developed a contour-based stereotest using a 46-in. 3D monitor, which can measure 5000 to 20 arcsec of distance stereopsis.

What we use now is a kind of mature 3D display called active shutter glasses, which is widely used to view 3D movies or to play 3D video games. The core components of the active shutter 3D system are liquid crystal shutter glasses and a monitor with a high refresh rate. The principle of this technique is that the glasses contain a liquid crystal layer which turns immediately from opaque to transparent when a voltage is applied, and the alternately block each of the two eyes, such that they receive different images. A high refresh rate monitor of 120 Hz, equipped with a time controller, can display two different images alternately, synchronizing with the shutter glasses; therefore, each eye receives a different image. Because the transition from unblocking to blocking is so fast, the observer still receives 60 frames per second in each eye and therefore could perceive the displayed image as if looking at a regular screen; hence the binocular vision is divided. When the computer alternates between the two components of a 3D image, subjects will perceive a 3D image.

### Prismatic displacement effect of progressive multifocal glasses on reaction time and accuracy in elderly people [^041e6c26]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Study design

Community dwelling participants were recruited through optometric practices in Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants were residents 75-years-old or older from the Dunedin and Mosgiel communities who had acquired a new or updated prescription for a PAL within the last 12 months. The study received ethical approval from the Lower South Regional Ethics Committee.

Exclusion criteria were: 1) poorer than 6/12 vision in one eye or 6/12 with binocular vision when corrected with glasses;2) ocular/retinal problems (ie, age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, field defects, and ocular-motor disorders); 3) > 2 diopter difference of spherical anisometropia; 4) > 4 diopter of oblique astigmatism; 5) deformities of the arms, neck, or head; 6) inability to stand; 7) suffering from dizziness or a recent injury or medical condition that affected coordination and ability to grasp; 8) not being able to understand the study requirements; and 9) a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)score lower than 26.

Baseline information was collected from the participant's optometrist's notes and a home visit conducted by the investigator. Information was recorded about demographics, living arrangement, medical conditions, medication use, and visual acuity plus physical functioning. The order of the tests of the two types of glasses was randomized with the investigator blinded to the order; the position of the bar/black line at the maximal or minimal prismatic displacement was randomized. A statistician not involved with the study prepared a computer-generated randomization schedule and opaque envelopes with instructions for the order of glasses to be worn. The schedule was made available on testing day and explained to the participant by a person independent of the study, to preserve blinding of the investigator. Numbered tags were placed on the frames of each pair of glasses to allow the participant to wear the glasses in the correct order. Each pair of glasses were adjusted and measured so that the eye was 20 mm away from the vertex of the lens. The investigator restated the need for the participant to "refrain from describing the glasses as progressives or single distance" as it is imperative that the investigator did not know the order during and after the test.

It was not possible for an inexperienced observer to tell if the glasses were PALs or single vision glasses. Because of this the investigator remained blind to the subsequent analysis of the order of glasses. Any adjustment of the participant's new single vision glasses frames occurred before blinding.

### Metasurface-driven full-space structured light for three-dimensional imaging [^4ba45e83]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

By illuminating laser light to the nano-PER-based metasurface printed on glasses (Fig. 5 e), 2D line array pattern is experimentally demonstrated to cover the full-space as shown in Fig. 5f. Here, the size of printed metasurface is 510 μm by 510 μm. Note that, due to the nonlinearity between spatial frequency and propagation angle described as Eq. (1), line pattern on the flat observation plane shows curved shape at large angle with respect to optical axis. Although we do not provide an explicit demonstration of depth estimation using these patterns, we highlight the versatility of our proposed metasurface with scalable nanofabrication methods in that it can be developed to generate the different patterns required for existing 3D reconstruction algorithms.

### Polar vortex hidden in twisted bilayers of paraelectric SrTiO [^c6884edf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Based on the recovered phases at different depths, the positions of O and TiO columns at different depths are determined by Gaussian peak fitting. These positions were then used to calculate the polar displacements, which are defined as the relative displacement between each TiO column and its four nearest O columns (δ O-Ti). The polar displacements of the slices in the upper layer are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 4, while those in the lower layer are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 5. Supplementary Movie S2 is used to show the variation process of the polarization in depth.

Polar vortices emerge in both upper and lower layers. In the upper layer, vortices are formed at the depth of 11.2 nm and maintain such an arrangement to the depth of 12.0 nm (Supplementary Fig. 4). The polarization mapping in Fig. 2c specifically focuses on the section at a depth of 12.0 nm. Here, the vortices exhibit counterclockwise (CCW) rotation. The vortices have a diameter of approximately 7–10 unit cells and are distributed between the regions with the same stacking sequence. Figure 2d shows the vorticity, which is calculated as the z-component of the curl of the polar displacement (∇⨯ P) [001]. Vortices with CCW rotation form the regions with positive vorticity. Between the regions with different stacking sequences, vorticity is mainly negative. Moving to the lower layer, polar vortices form a regular array in the depth of 23.2 nm, approximately 7 nm below the interface (Fig. 2e, f). The core positions of the CCW vortices shift laterally compared to the upper layer, which can be caused by a non-periodic strain field and terraces at the interface.

### A multi-directional backlight for a wide-angle, glasses-free three-dimensional display [^a4f7dc59]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Multiview three-dimensional (3D) displays can project the correct perspectives of a 3D image in many spatial directions simultaneously. They provide a 3D stereoscopic experience to many viewers at the same time with full motion parallax and do not require special glasses or eye tracking. None of the leading multiview 3D solutions is particularly well suited to mobile devices (watches, mobile phones or tablets), which require the combination of a thin, portable form factor, a high spatial resolution and a wide full-parallax view zone (for short viewing distance from potentially steep angles). Here we introduce a multi-directional diffractive backlight technology that permits the rendering of high-resolution, full-parallax 3D images in a very wide view zone (up to 180 degrees in principle) at an observation distance of up to a metre. The key to our design is a guided-wave illumination technique based on light-emitting diodes that produces wide-angle multiview images in colour from a thin planar transparent lightguide. Pixels associated with different views or colours are spatially multiplexed and can be independently addressed and modulated at video rate using an external shutter plane. To illustrate the capabilities of this technology, we use simple ink masks or a high-resolution commercial liquid-crystal display unit to demonstrate passive and active (30 frames per second) modulation of a 64-view backlight, producing 3D images with a spatial resolution of 88 pixels per inch and full-motion parallax in an unprecedented view zone of 90 degrees. We also present several transparent hand-held prototypes showing animated sequences of up to six different 200-view images at a resolution of 127 pixels per inch.

### Combinatorial design of textured mechanical metamaterials [^eb2640e7]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

The structural complexity of metamaterials is limitless, but, in practice, most designs comprise periodic architectures that lead to materials with spatially homogeneous features. More advanced applications in soft robotics, prosthetics and wearable technology involve spatially textured mechanical functionality, which requires aperiodic architectures. However, a naive implementation of such structural complexity invariably leads to geometrical frustration (whereby local constraints cannot be satisfied everywhere), which prevents coherent operation and impedes functionality. Here we introduce a combinatorial strategy for the design of aperiodic, yet frustration-free, mechanical metamaterials that exhibit spatially textured functionalities. We implement this strategy using cubic building blocks-voxels-that deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule that allows cooperative shape changes by guaranteeing that deformed building blocks fit together as in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, and three-dimensional printing. These aperiodic metamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, whereby the two-dimensional pixelated surface texture dictates the three-dimensional interior voxel arrangement. They also act as programmable shape-shifters, morphing into spatially complex, but predictable and designable, shapes when uniaxially compressed. Finally, their mechanical response to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform sensing and pattern analysis. Combinatorial design thus opens up a new avenue towards mechanical metamaterials with unusual order and machine-like functionalities.

### Starting geometry creation and design method for freeform optics [^fa76bd28]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

For each potential geometry, the first step is to create a first-order unobscured layout (using only spherical surfaces) in a volume near what is desirable for the end result while minimizing the mirror tilts to the extent possible, as described earlier in this section. Then, the aberration FFDs for each potential unobscured geometry are evaluated. With spherical surfaces, the tilt-induced rotationally variant aberrations can be orders of magnitude greater than the rotationally invariant aberrations. The focus is placed on the potential for the rotationally variant aberrations to be corrected, because if they cannot be mitigated, the correction state of the rotationally invariant aberrations is inconsequential. Furthermore, at the appropriate time during optimization, the third-order rotationally invariant aberrations can be removed using a conic on each mirror.

### Waveguide holography for 3D augmented reality glasses [^28686e14]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Waveguide fabrication

The waveguide is fabricated with a glass substrate with refractive index of 1.5 and 1.15 mm thickness. The thickness of the substrate is selected based on the simulation to achieve a good performance and still retain the thin form factor. The center TIR angle is set at 50 degrees with the center wavelength of 532 nm. The waveguide is designed to support 28 degrees of diagonal field of view with an outcoupler size of 16 × 12 mm. The waveguide samples are fabricated using a nano-imprinting method which is suitable for mass production. The specifications of surface relief gratings such as shape, slant angle, and aspect ratio are fine-tuned using rigorous simulations to achieve spatial and angular uniformity at the eyebox domain (see Supplementary Fig. 3). In general, targeting higher uniformity reduces the grating efficiency and thus trades overall efficiency. We set the merit function to balance between uniformity and efficiency, to achieve over 5% of end-to-end throughput efficiency on average and maximize the uniformity. The grating structure is designed as a saw-tooth shape to minimize the unwanted diffraction orders, however it diffracts some portion of light as −1st order. Therefore, we used a beam splitter in the hologram projection module and the light source was expanded outside of the system. Further details are presented in Supplementary Material.

### Infrared spectroscopic laser scanning confocal microscopy for whole-slide chemical imaging [^4dba9a09]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Design and performance evaluation of IR-LSM

LSMs are often reported for rapid, high-resolution imaging, where small oscillating mirrors quickly sweep a beam through a complex series of optics designed to precisely maintain a tight focal volume across the sample. Our IR-LSM design follows the same strategy, consisting of a series of fully custom compound optics designed in tandem — namely, a 4× magnification scan lens (SL), a tube lens (TL), and two interchangeable infinity-corrected objectives (OBJ) for 10× and 20× magnification with numerical apertures (NA) of 0.4 and 0.8 respectively — all corrected for mid-IR wavelengths that are 10-fold longer and of a 10-fold wider bandwidth than typical design specifications for the visible spectrum. The designed system is detailed schematically in Fig. 1a with a glossary of abbreviations presented in the Supplementary Information. It uses an assembly of four external cavity QCLs, emitting a narrow-band beam tunable across the molecular fingerprint spectral range. A detection pinhole passes only the transflected light conjugate to a near-diffraction limited focal volume on the sample plane while rejecting stray reflections from optical and mounting surfaces that manifest as ghost images or lens flare. The individual optical assemblies are designed by forgoing the use of common, but IR-opaque, silica glasses. Instead, we guided an optimizer to continuously model and search through thousands of combinations of materials and surface parameters by fine tuning individual constraints bounding the search space and weighing key performance metrics (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). Additional considerations included form factor restrictions relating to end-user practicality and fabrication feasibility, analyzing tolerance sensitivity to maximize the probability of achieving designed results, and ensuring that costs did not become unduly high. From a balance of these factors, we selected ~10 leading designs and further iterated each depending on current manufacturing capabilities. After optimization, the final selections were custom fabricated (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S2) in multiple iterations to ensure performance as per design. The two objective assemblies we obtained offer a balance between common coverage and resolution, requiring materials indicated by the color-coded scheme. While these assemblies have considerably more elements than most off-the-shelf IR optics, as necessary to achieve high focusing power over a wide spectral and spatial range, the key to this design is that it is still relatively simple compared to most visible microscope assemblies, and thus practical to realize. The optimized surface parameters and theoretical performance curves of these designs are presented in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Figs. S3–6).

### Septin higher-order structure on yeast membranes in vitro [^ee93ec9c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Second-layer septin filaments are templated by first-layer filaments

With sufficient incubation time and low imaging forces, septin filaments formed a second-layer on top of the first septin layer when assembled on yeast polar lipid membranes (Fig. 5), corroborating the capability of septin to form 3D supramolecular structures. Again, we took advantage of HS-AFM force-sweep experiments to confirm the presence and analyze the relative orientation of the first (lower, membrane-attached) layer septin filaments with respect to the second (upper) layer filaments. After imaging the second-layer filaments at low force to obtain high resolution images and reveal their orientation (Fig. 5a, t = 0 s, Fig. 5b, c, left), the force was slightly increased to selectively remove the second-layer filaments (Fig. 5a, t = 50 s, t = 70 s,), and image the filaments in the first (lower) layer Fig. 5a, t = 130 s, Fig. 5b, c, right). The orientation of the first and second layers were found perfectly aligned, showing that growth of the second-layer is templated by the first-layer. Previously we showed that on mica the septin filaments could form second and third layers, leading to the possibility of larger multilayer stacks. As we documented in our comparative analysis of filaments on yeast membranes and on mica (Fig. 3), septins orient differently on the two substrates, and certainly the filament orientation on the native-like membrane is more native. With this regard, we hypothesized that the stacking of the second layer with the first was different than what we reported on mica - nevertheless, it is clear that higher up located filaments are templated by their underlying neighbors with a strong tendency to adapt to their orientation. This is highlighted by the two areas (indicated by * and) of differently oriented first-layer filaments (Fig. 5c, right, t = 130 s) that are matched by the second-layer filaments before the force-sweep experiment (Fig. 5c, left, t = 0 s).

### Controlled rotation of the F ₁-ATPase reveals differential and continuous binding changes for ATP synthesis [^89503d2b]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Results

Binding events during forced rotation

We observed binding and release of a fluorescent nucleotide analogue, Cy3-ATP or Cy3-ADP, on single molecules of F₁ fixed on a glass surface with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Fig. 1a). Simultaneously, we rotated the magnetic bead(s) on γ with electromagnets while imaging the bead movement with bright-field microscopy. Cy3-nucleotide, when bound to F₁, appeared as a brightly fluorescent stationary spot (Fig. 1b), while unbound and diffusing Cy3-nucleotide gave a dim, uniform background. To resolve binding and release angles at the video rate of 30 frames s⁻¹, we rotated the magnetic field in either direction at 0.2 Hz (0.05–0.5 Hz in some experiments). Preselected molecules (Methods) were observed for 5–60 min, typically ~20 min.

Cy3-nucleotide bound to F₁ gave similar fluorescence intensities irrespective of its orientation, because the excitation was unpolarized in the sample plane. The intensities of Cy3-ATP and Cy3-ADP were nearly indistinguishable. Thus, we could follow the changes in the occupancy number (the number of bound nucleotides) and identify binding events (Fig. 1c, d, and Supplementary Fig. S1). For binding events lasting three video frames (0.1 s) or longer, we determined the binding (θ on) and release (θ off) angles from the bead image. Shorter events, possibly noise, were ignored. We took one of the three ATP-waiting angles, observed in 60-nM ATP before Cy3-nucleotide infusion, as θ = 0°, and measured θ in the hydrolysis direction (θ decreases in synthesis). In Fig. 2, we plot angles of all binding events that began from an occupancy of zero, including second binding to occupancy two (see diagrams at top right); we never observed clear cases of an occupancy of three. The angles of the first on events (horizontal axis) as well as subsequent off or on angles (vertical axis) display basic 120° symmetry, as expected for the presence of three catalytic sites. The concentration of Cy3-nucleotide, [Cy3-nucleotide], or the rotary speed did not significantly affect the angle distributions.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^0a1b25b3]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD assessment — case history, ancillary information, and direct observation — emphasizes that case history information can be obtained through standard clinical interview procedures and may involve interviewing the patient, his/her parents or other family members, or another informant who is responsible for the patient, and a review of available medical, educational, and clinical records can help to further elucidate the nature of the problems or difficulties that the individual is experiencing. Case history review can also serve to document the presence or absence of any comorbid condition(s) and help inform professional decisions regarding (1) the need to modify diagnostic test procedures or protocols, (2) the need to refer for follow-up cognitive, speech and language, educational, and/or behavioral testing, and (3) the need to consider modifications to the intervention plan if a (C) APD is identified and the individual is also experiencing a comorbid condition or conditions. Ancillary information can also be gained through direct observation of the individual's behaviors during the interview itself or in some other context, and completion of behavioral inventories and/or checklists by people familiar with the individual also provides useful insights into functional deficits, diagnostic test selection, and intervention priorities. Self-assessment tools and/or behavioral checklists completed by individuals familiar with the individual can provide the audiologist with important insights into the individual's specific auditory deficits and the functional impact of these deficits, and there are a number of instruments that can be used for this purpose, including some developed specifically for use with individuals who may be at-risk for (C)APD and others that are more generic. Direct observation of the individual at-risk for (C)APD can provide additional information about the individual's auditory behaviors and difficulties, and the audiologist can gain invaluable insights during the interview process as well as throughout the diagnostic process by carefully observing the individual's behavior. Although more difficult to arrange, the direct observation of the individual in a naturalistic setting, such as in school or at work, is potentially more revealing than the observation of the individual in the clinical setting, and direct observation complements and supplements the case history interview. The answers to these types of questions can inform the audiologist's selection of tests for inclusion in the test battery, and will also provide a solid foundation for intervention planning should the individual ultimately be diagnosed with a (C)APD. Levels of evidence: 4, 5.

### Achromatic vector vortex beams from a glass cone [^d2576495]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The reflection of light is governed by the laws first described by Augustin-Jean Fresnel: on internal reflection, light acquires a phase shift, which depends on its polarization direction with respect to the plane of incidence. For a conical reflector, the cylindrical symmetry is echoed in an angular variation of this phase shift, allowing us to create light modes with phase and polarization singularities. Here we observe the phase and polarization profiles of light that is back reflected from a solid glass cone and, in the case of circular input light, discover that not only does the beam contain orbital angular momentum but can trivially be converted to a radially polarized beam. Importantly, the Fresnel coefficients are reasonably stable across the visible spectrum, which we demonstrate by measuring white light polarization profiles. This discovery provides a highly cost-effective technique for the generation of broadband orbital angular momentum and radially polarized beams.

Results and discussion

Hexagonal ErMnO₃ as representative of the R MnO₃ family with R = Sc, Y, In, Dy–Lu is formed by layers of corner-sharing MnO₅ bipyramids alternating with sheets of Er 3+ ions. A phase transition from the non-polar P 6 3 / m m c to the polar P 6 3 c m space group occurs at T C ≈ 1430 K. It results from the collective tilting of every three neighbouring MnO₅ trigonal bipyramids whose apical O²⁻ ions jointly move along the radial direction relative to their central Er³⁺ site. The associated lattice mode has K 3 symmetry and is parameterized by an amplitude Q and azimuthal rotation angle Φ, see Fig. 1. The distortion activates a polar displacement of the Er 3+ ions along the c axis, giving rise to improper ferroelectricity with a polarization. This leads to six possible domain states with Φ = n × 60 ∘ (n = 0, 1,.5), displaying ΔΦ = 60 ∘ and, hence, alternating polarization between neighbouring domains. The system is famous for the formation of ferroelectric pseudo-vortices –, which arise due to the breaking of the effectively continuous symmetry of Φ close to the Curie temperature –.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

Table 1
Examples of the types of questions associated with complex interventions, systems and evidence to decision (EtD) frameworks

Further guidance on determining the focus of a QES to inform or explain effectiveness and complexity is provided elsewhere. The following steps outline how to identify the focus of a QES:
Problem framing: Identifying the issues that need addressing. QES is used in reviews of complex interventions and guideline development to increase understanding of aspects such as context, implementation and views of a complex intervention. As a result, the issues that need addressing are directly linked to the need for evidence that describes or explains the phenomenon. There are multiple ways to frame a problem which subsequently inform the direction a review may take. A transparent process is recommended, as the review question may be revised on the basis of preliminary findings from the problem framing. Involving stakeholders in problem framing is key, in order to explore 'What', 'For whom' and 'Why' and in 'What context' the problem exists. Through consultation with stakeholders, issues such as acceptability and implementation challenges will become apparent.
Constructing a preliminary framework or logic model to illustrate relationships. The use of theoretical frameworks or logic models in reviews of complex interventions/systems is becoming increasingly common across all types of QES. Such frameworks or models seek to present relationships between the problem, its explanatory evidence, how it may be implemented and its outcomes which, in turn, inform the focus and direction of the review. Theoretical frameworks are useful in explaining the possible relationships between concepts that are the focus of a review/guideline in general terms. More pragmatic illustrations of how the components of an intervention, programme or guideline may work together in a specific population and context are presented in logic models.
Developing an understanding of context: Selecting a contextual frame that is appropriate to the complexity of the review question. One of the fundamental purposes of a QES conducted with a complexity perspective is to develop an understanding of relevant contextual factors. Knowledge of such factors will inform decisions on the ultimate scope of the search, inclusion and exclusion criteria and later considerations of transferability. How context may be addressed in relation to question formulation is explained in more detail in the paper by Booth et al in this series. Additionally, numerous contextual frames existthat can be used to help develop an understanding and impact of context in relation scope of the review; for example, the Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework is an overarching framework of interacting dimensions of context (including setting) and implementation.
Identifying potential lines of inquiry: Considering which questions relate to effectiveness, implementation, feasibility, appropriateness of the intervention or strategy for implementation. The qualitative component of a review of complex interventions/systems may select one or more lines of inquiry in order to fully interrogate the question. Lines of inquiry addressed by the qualitative component can include questions about meaningfulness, appropriateness, feasibility, equity, affordability and implementation.
Searching to explore the knowledge base: Scoping the amount and type of knowledge and evidence currently available. Scoping the literature is vital to allow for the emergence of clear research questions to guide the reviewers. The scoping process seeks to determine the extent and availability of relevant research and also allows a preliminary assessment of its depth and quality to be made. Approaches to searching to establish the scope of a QES are well developed. After the initial scoping, further searches can be used to inform refinement of a review protocol.
Formulating, focusing and refining questions: In relation to what is already known. Following scoping, the review question can be revisited or refocused where required prior to the main review searches being undertaken. Frameworks for structuring the question are well established, although their limitations are acknowledged with a new variant being proposed as part of this series. Within a guideline development process, the focus of the question for a review is commonly commissioned externally by the guideline developer. The use of an innovative question formulation framework can lead to qualitative evidence being used to contribute more nuanced insights within a complex interventions framework.
Developing the protocol: Using the preliminary questions and searching to understand how and why an intervention might work, taking into account the interactions between individuals and surrounding context. A protocol should be developed that presents an argument for the importance of the review, its relevance to the problems described and its potential utility to policymakers. The review question(s) should emerge naturally from the preliminary work and should include an approach to both the selection and appraisal of studies and synthesis that potentially enables reviewers to answer the questions.

Conclusions

Endorsed definition

The current paper largely confirmed existing definitions whilst building on/expanding the latter by proposing a new iteration as follows: Integrating findings and defining attributes with contextual factors, we define CCHC as involving one or more chronic condition(s), regardless of type(s), whose trajectories are dynamic, requiring services across settings and/or sectors, taking into account severity/intensity of conditions and CCHC's developmental age whilst being unique to each child and family's context, often resulting in a lower quality of life. This comprehensive definition can facilitate communication, collaboration, and coordination of care among families, practitioners, researchers, and decision makers. As mentioned earlier, the originality of our paper lies in in the integration of the stakeholders'/family's input in the development of the definition. As a concept analysis is a work in progress, our findings are provisional. Future research will help to refine the understanding of this concept.

### Groupitizing modifies neural coding of numerosity [^cd1a4f89]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

EPI images were preprocessed and analyzed with FSFAST tools of Freesurfer 6.0. Preprocessing included motion correction and smoothing with a 3D Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 5 mm). We performed surface‐based reconstruction and individual participants' data were sampled to the left and right hemisphere of fsaverage (the surface area of the Freesurfer average subject).

The preprocessed EPI images were entered into two general linear models estimated on subject's volume and on fsaverage surface space. Predictors were convolved with the SPM canonical hemodynamic response function. In the first General Linear Model (GLM), for each participant we separately modeled the following six regressors: 4 conditions (2 spatial arrangements × 2 tasks), the instruction and the response trials. To identify which brain regions were involved in numerosity estimation of ungrouped and grouped arrays, for each participant we contrasted the activity elicited during the number task (separately when performed on ungrouped and grouped arrays) against that elicited during the respective control conditions (i.e. "Ungrouped number task > Ungrouped shape control task"; and "Grouped number task > Grouped shape control task"). We then performed a random effects group analysis. The resulting statistical maps were thresholded at p < .001, using correction for multiple comparison at cluster level (Hagler, Saygin, & Sereno,) with a cluster forming threshold p < .001. Next, to reveal regions that responded more to the number task than to their respective control conditions, both when the arrays were ungrouped and grouped, we performed a conjunction of random effect analysis across the two contrasts: "(Grouped number task > Grouped shape control task) ∩ (Ungrouped number task > Ungrouped shape control task)". This analysis showed the brain regions that were activated for both contrasts (not just either). Finally, for each participant we determined whether there were brain regions that showed greater activation specifically (and not shared) for the number task when the arrays were grouped or ungrouped after subtracting out activity associated with their control tasks: "(Grouped number task > Grouped shape control task) > (Ungrouped number task > Ungrouped shape control task)"; and "(Ungrouped number task > Ungrouped shape control task) > (Grouped number task > Grouped shape control task)". We then performed a random effects group analysis, as described above.

Disability models — social, functional (rehabilitation), human rights, and the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) — are delineated by how they frame disability and guide assessment. In the social model, disability is framed as a social construct shaped by environments, with individual impairment no longer defining disability and environments that either support or limit participation and the experience of disability. The functional model is described as pragmatic and cross-diagnostic, conceptualizing disability as a social consequence of functional capacities and limitations and as best understood in the context of social and occupational demands; in this model, psychologists facilitate clients' functional improvement and development of adaptive strategies. The human rights model serves as the basis for the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and views persons with disabilities as rights holders while noting that social structures and policies restricting or ignoring rights often lead to discrimination and exclusion. The ICF model integrates medical, social, and functional dimensions within a positive, enablement-focused framework in which impairment is conceptualized as a difference or change in body function or structure, and functional limitations become disabling through broader physical, social, and attitudinal factors that restrict participation; authors also emphasize the importance of using measures of constructs mapped by the ICF and recommend linking the ICF-postulated assessment model to individual and social interventions.

### Search strategies (filters) to identify systematic reviews in MEDLINE and embase [^981f735c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bibliographic databases provide access to an international body of scientific literature in health and medical sciences. Systematic reviews are an important source of evidence for clinicians, researchers, consumers, and policymakers as they address a specific health-related question and use explicit methods to identify, appraise and synthesize evidence from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made. Methodological search filters help database end-users search the literature effectively with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. These filters have been developed for various study designs and have been found to be particularly useful for intervention studies. Other filters have been developed for finding systematic reviews. Considering the variety and number of available search filters for systematic reviews, there is a need for a review of them in order to provide evidence about their retrieval properties at the time they were developed.

Objectives

To review systematically empirical studies that report the development, evaluation, or comparison of search filters to retrieve reports of systematic reviews in MEDLINE and Embase.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from inception to January 2023: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO; Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (LISTA) and Science Citation Index (Web of Science).

Selection Criteria

We included studies if one of their primary objectives is the development, evaluation, or comparison of a search filter that could be used to retrieve systematic reviews on MEDLINE, Embase, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-specified and piloted data extraction form using InterTASC Information Specialist Subgroup (ISSG) Search Filter Evaluation Checklist.

Main Results

We identified eight studies that developed filters for MEDLINE and three studies that developed filters for Embase. Most studies are very old and some were limited to systematic reviews in specific clinical areas. Six included studies reported the sensitivity of their developed filter. Seven studies reported precision and six studies reported specificity. Only one study reported the number needed to read and positive predictive value. None of the filters were designed to differentiate systematic reviews on the basis of their methodological quality. For MEDLINE, all filters showed similar sensitivity and precision, and one filter showed higher levels of specificity. For Embase, filters showed variable sensitivity and precision, with limited study reports that may affect accuracy assessments. The report of these studies had some limitations, and the assessments of their accuracy may suffer from indirectness, considering that they were mostly developed before the release of the PRISMA 2009 statement or due to their limited scope in the selection of systematic review topics. Search filters for MEDLINE Three studies produced filters with sensitivity > 90% with variable degrees of precision, and only one of them was developed and validated in a gold-standard database, which allowed the calculation of specificity. The other two search filters had lower levels of sensitivity. One of these produced a filter with higher levels of specificity (> 90%). All filters showed similar sensitivity and precision in the external validation, except for one which was not externally validated and another one which was conceptually derived and only externally validated. Search filters for Embase We identified three studies that developed filters for this database. One of these studies developed filters with variable sensitivity and precision, including highly sensitive strategies (> 90%); however, it was not externally validated. The other study produced a filter with a lower sensitivity (72.7%) but high specificity (99.1%) with a similar performance in the external validation.

Authors' Conclusions

Studies reporting the development, evaluation, or comparison of search filters to retrieve reports of systematic reviews in MEDLINE showed similar sensitivity and precision, with one filter showing higher levels of specificity. For Embase, filters showed variable sensitivity and precision, with limited information about how the filter was produced, which leaves us uncertain about their performance assessments. Newer filters had limitations in their methods or scope, including very focused subject topics for their gold standards, limiting their applicability across other topics. Our findings highlight that consensus guidance on the conduct of search filters and standardized reporting of search filters are needed, as we found highly heterogeneous development methods, accuracy assessments and outcome selection. New strategies adaptable across interfaces could enhance their usability. Moreover, the performance of existing filters needs to be evaluated in light of the impact of reporting guidelines, including the PRISMA 2009, on how systematic reviews are reported. Finally, future filter developments should also consider comparing the filters against a common reference set to establish comparative performance and assess the quality of systematic reviews retrieved by strategies.

a 2D image recorded by the cameras. b Balanced signals measured for pixel pairs A 1 A 2 and B 1 B 2. c 3D point cloud. Here, x, y, and z stand for spatial coordinates. The color bar represents the values in the z- axis (i.e. the depths). d Picture of a glass plate with a thin metallic foil attached to it. e Topographic imaging of the glass plate. The optical path (Δ d · n r) between the foil and back surface is measured to be 4.694 mm, resulting in a plate thickness of Δ d = 3.128 mm for the glass refractive index n r = 1.5008.

In this measurement, we simultaneously obtain range information for dense spatial points (up to 4.67 × 10⁷ pixel pairs), visualized as a false-color 3D point cloud in Fig. 4c. For display, the axial (z) coordinates are referenced to the point B 1 B 2. Also, points lacking illumination or without a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are not displayed. Note that the f r tuning step size is 606 Hz/frame, resulting in an axial resolution of 33 µm (Methods). This resolution can be improved to 54 nm with a step size of 1 Hz/frame at the cost of longer tuning time.

In another example, we perform 3D imaging on a 30%-reflective unpolished metallic foil attached to a 1-inch glass plate (Fig. 4d). This target is positioned 1.3 m away. Figure 4e presents a topographic image showing reflections from both the foil and the glass back surface. This showcases our method's ability to remotely profile metal component surfaces and complex patterns, which is applicable for industrial inspection.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^96eff6b3]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Cough guideline methodology — PICO refinement, literature searches, and quality assessments are outlined as follows: Each topic-specific committee drafted key clinical questions that a frontline clinician and consumer representative agreed would provide important guidance, and with a methodologist these key questions were formulated to examine descriptors of the relevant PICO; these PICO elements then informed the search strategies, including synonyms, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for study screening and acceptance. Searches were conducted in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network Library, with additional searches for published systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library; when no reasonable quality systematic reviews were identified, primary literature searches were conducted in at least two databases using the predefined search strategies, and Medline and the Cochrane Library were always searched for relevant English language studies and, depending on the topic, other databases (eg, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Identified English-language articles were initially screened by title and abstract, using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria followed by full-text screening of qualified articles; search strategies are available upon request at science@chestnet.org, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferentially assessed using DART, which was adopted in 2011 for CHEST guidelines and consensus statements; quality was assessed for individual studies and the body of relevant evidence, with randomized controlled trials primarily indicating benefits and observational studies helpful in identifying harms and examined when RCTs were not available.
