## Question

Periorbital redness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage periorbital redness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags that distinguish benign dermatoses from vision- or life-threatening infections. Then, I should categorize the differential by pathophysiology and extract key bedside discriminators. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination strategy, followed by targeted testing. After that, I will map management by etiology, including when to use steroids, antibiotics, or immunomodulators. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and when to refer urgently, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities, because I need to ensure we do not miss orbital cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, or other emergencies. Pain with eye movement, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, decreased visual acuity, or afferent pupillary defect push me toward orbital cellulitis and mandate emergent ophthalmology and imaging; fever, severe pain, and systemic toxicity raise concern for necrotizing fasciitis and require immediate surgical consultation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, as delays worsen outcomes [^116asCNT] [^1163rR7h] [^111DoPB8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the anatomic compartment next. Preseptal cellulitis presents with eyelid erythema and edema without proptosis or ophthalmoplegia, whereas orbital cellulitis adds proptosis, pain with movement, and visual compromise. Distinguishing these at the bedside guides urgency and route of therapy, and I should remember that preseptal can progress to orbital, especially in children, so I need to monitor closely if I initially label it preseptal [^116asCNT] [^1163rR7h].

> Next, I will categorize the differential by mechanism to structure my thinking. Infectious causes include preseptal and orbital cellulitis, herpetic disease, and dacryoadenitis or dacryocystitis; inflammatory or allergic causes include allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, airborne dermatitis, rosacea, and blepharitis; vascular or systemic causes include angioedema, thyroid eye disease, and drug-induced changes; neoplastic and structural causes include tumors and post-surgical or filler-related edema; and I should keep systemic vasculitides and metabolic conditions like amyloidosis in mind when the story fits [^111XWQFZ] [^115FEToq] [^112MAxKs] [^114wWq9n] [^114NXHWw].

> I will now examine the morphology and distribution, because these often narrow the field quickly. Scaly, pruritic, ill-defined erythema suggests atopic dermatitis; sharply demarcated erythema with vesicles or crusting points to contact dermatitis; violaceous heliotrope with Gottron papules implies dermatomyositis; papules and pustules on a background of flushing favor rosacea; vesicles respecting the V1 dermatome with Hutchinson sign indicate herpes zoster ophthalmicus; and nonblanching violaceous periorbital dyschromia that precedes systemic symptoms has been reported as an early COVID-19 sign, though I should confirm with testing and context before anchoring on that [^112SfK1i] [^116NxeaG] [^117J154K] [^115FEToq] [^116asCNT] [^112G92Mb] [^113BRsLV].

> Wait, let me verify the time course and triggers, because they refine pretest probabilities. Acute onset after new cosmetics, eyedrops, or jewelry supports contact dermatitis. Recurrent seasonal symptoms with itching suggest allergic conjunctivitis. Chronic relapsing pruritic eczema with atopy supports atopic dermatitis. And new-onset unilateral swelling with pain and fever raises preseptal or orbital cellulitis, particularly with concurrent sinusitis or trauma [^116NxeaG] [^1123hYrp] [^112SfK1i] [^116asCNT].

> I need to check for associated ocular and systemic features to avoid missing ocular surface disease or systemic clues. Conjunctival injection, tearing, photophobia, or mucus discharge point to conjunctivitis or blepharitis. Proptosis, lid retraction, or diplopia suggest thyroid eye disease. Proximal muscle weakness or elevated enzymes raise dermatomyositis. And macroglossia, neuropathy, or cardiac symptoms could indicate AL amyloidosis, so I should ask targeted review-of-systems questions accordingly [^1123hYrp] [^112MAxKs] [^114wWq9n] [^114NXHWw].

> Let me consider special populations, because thresholds and differentials shift. In children, preseptal cellulitis is more common and progression to orbital disease is a key risk. In older adults, rosacea and contact dermatitis predominate. In patients with glaucoma on prostaglandin analogs, periorbital erythema, deepening of the sulcus, and ptosis are recognized adverse effects. And in patients with recent hyaluronic acid fillers, delayed periorbital edema may occur and requires a different management pathway [^116asCNT] [^111NCfsK] [^114NjnKt] [^116kth14] [^114qUQHD].

> Next, I should review the focused history elements I must not miss. I need to ask about new cosmetics, skincare, eyedrops, or jewelry; occupational and household exposures; atopy history; recent URI or sinus symptoms; trauma or insect bites; fever or myalgias; medication changes including NSAIDs, antibiotics, or glaucoma drops; and any prior similar episodes, because these steer me toward contact dermatitis, infection, or drug-induced disease [^116NxeaG] [^116asCNT].

> I will now examine the lids, ocular surface, and orbit systematically. I should inspect for vesicles, crusting, scale, pustules, or plaques; palpate for warmth, induration, or focal masses; check extraocular movements and visual acuity; assess for proptosis, conjunctival chemosis, and pain with movement; and look for Hutchinson sign at the nasal tip to gauge ocular involvement risk in herpes zoster, documenting any limitation of movements or afferent pupillary defect if present [^116asCNT].

> Hold on, I should verify when ancillary testing is indicated. If contact dermatitis is suspected, patch testing to standard and patient-specific products is the gold standard. If infection is suspected and the diagnosis is uncertain, CBC and cultures may help. If orbital involvement is possible, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is indicated. And if systemic disease is on the table, targeted labs such as ANA, CK, thyroid function, or syphilis serology should be sent, guided by the clinical picture [^116N3kRh] [^116asCNT] [^113gZopS].

> For allergic contact dermatitis, I should confirm avoidance of identified allergens and reinforce barrier repair. Emollients are foundational. Short courses of low-potency topical corticosteroids on the eyelids are reasonable, but I need to minimize duration due to atrophy risk. Calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus are steroid-sparing alternatives. And strict allergen avoidance is essential to prevent recurrence, with patient education on product selection and preservative awareness [^116NxeaG] [^112DydqR] [^113nmeXP].

> For atopic dermatitis, I need to ensure a maintenance regimen that reduces flares. Gentle skin care, frequent emollients, and anti-inflammatory therapy during flares are core; topical corticosteroids remain first-line for acute inflammation on the eyelids at low potency, with close monitoring for cutaneous adverse effects; and nonsteroidal options such as crisaborole or calcineurin inhibitors can be used for maintenance or in sensitive areas to mitigate steroid risks [^112DydqR].

> For blepharitis, I should double-check lid hygiene and meibomian gland management. Warm compresses, lid scrubs, and omega-3 supplementation can improve symptoms; in inflammatory rosacea-associated blepharitis, oral tetracyclines or topical azithromycin may be added; and I should escalate to ophthalmology if there is visual compromise, severe pain, or chronic refractory disease despite optimized local therapy [^111f3e9f].

> For herpetic disease, I need to act quickly to protect the cornea. Oral antivirals such as acyclovir or valacyclovir are indicated for herpes zoster ophthalmicus and HSV blepharoconjunctivitis, and urgent ophthalmology co-management is essential to monitor for keratitis, uveitis, and neuritis; topical antivirals may be added in ocular surface disease, but I should confirm the regimen with ophthalmology [^notfound].

> For preseptal cellulitis, I should confirm that there are no orbital signs and then treat promptly. Oral amoxicillin–clavulanate is a reasonable first-line choice in mild cases, with close follow-up; if there is penicillin allergy or local resistance patterns, clindamycin or a fluoroquinolone can be substituted per local guidelines; and I must arrange reassessment within 24–48 hours to ensure no progression to orbital disease [^1163rR7h].

> For orbital cellulitis, I need to ensure emergent management. Hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics with sinus and gram-positive coverage, and urgent ENT and ophthalmology consultation are mandatory. Imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is typically required to define extent and drainable collections. And I should avoid jumping to corticosteroids early because evidence for adjunctive steroids is limited and timing must be individualized after initial antibiotic response [^1163rR7h] [^111yakDY].

> But wait, what if the presentation is necrotizing fasciitis masquerading as angioedema. Severe pain out of proportion, skin anesthesia, crepitus, or rapid progression mandates immediate surgical debridement and high-dose broad-spectrum antibiotics; I should not delay for imaging if the clinical picture is convincing, as mortality rises with each hour of delay [^111DoPB8] [^113TeLzH].

> For drug-induced periorbital changes, I should confirm the culprit and stop it. Prostaglandin analogs can cause eyelid erythema, deepening of the sulcus, and ptosis; ophthalmic drops can provoke allergic contact dermatitis; and systemic agents like imatinib can cause periorbital edema requiring dose adjustment or surgical debulking if vision is compromised; documentation and discussion of alternatives are key [^114NjnKt] [^116kth14] [^116oQZwS] [^112ALnPk] [^111Sym8X].

> For filler-related edema, I should verify the material and timing. Delayed-onset periorbital edema after hyaluronic acid fillers often reflects lymphatic or venous flow disturbance and may be triggered by infection or inflammation; diagnostic ultrasound can guide management, and hyaluronidase injection is first-line therapy, with corticosteroids as adjuncts in inflammatory phenotypes; I should counsel on realistic timelines and possible need for additional procedures [^114qUQHD].

> I should double-check follow-up and safety netting. Red flags that require same-day ophthalmology include decreased vision, pain with eye movements, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or corneal involvement. Any patient not improving within 24–48 hours deserves re-evaluation for missed orbital disease, herpetic infection, or alternative diagnoses. And patients with chronic or recurrent periorbital dermatitis should be considered for patch testing to uncover occult allergens [^111NsXZf] [^116asCNT] [^116N3kRh].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing. Start with triage for orbital signs and necrotizing features. Categorize by morphology and time course. Elicit exposures and atopy. Perform a focused exam including ocular motility and vision. Order tests selectively based on suspicion. Treat by etiology with escalation for infection. Arrange timely follow-up or referral, documenting red flags and return precautions throughout [^116asCNT] [^1163rR7h] [^111NsXZf].

---

Periorbital redness most commonly reflects **allergic contact dermatitis** from cosmetics, preservatives, or topical medications [^116NxeaG], and **blepharitis** with eyelid margin inflammation and crusting [^112MAxKs]. Other causes include atopic dermatitis, rosacea, infections (preseptal/orbital cellulitis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus) [^116asCNT], and drug-induced erythema from prostaglandin analogs or antibiotics [^114NjnKt] [^116oQZwS] [^113S9T12]. Evaluation should focus on **history, exam, and patch testing** when contact allergy is suspected [^116N3kRh]; urgent ophthalmology is needed for pain, proptosis, diplopia, or vision changes [^111NsXZf]. Management is cause-specific: avoid allergens, topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors for dermatitis, antibiotics for infection, and eyelid hygiene for blepharitis [^112DydqR] [^1163rR7h] [^113gZopS].

## Common causes of periorbital redness

Key distinguishing features of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and blepharitis:

| **Aspect** | **Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)** | **Blepharitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiology | Cosmetics, fragrances, preservatives, topical medications, and ophthalmic solutions [^116NxeaG] [^111Sym8X]. | Inflammation of eyelid margins; associated with Meibomian gland dysfunction, bacterial colonization, or Demodex infestation [^112MAxKs]. |
| Clinical features | Pruritic, erythematous, edematous eyelids; may be bilateral [^1122Dp3Y]. | Eyelid margin erythema, crusting, irritation, and foreign body sensation [^112MAxKs]. |
| Diagnosis | Clinical history; patch testing is the gold standard [^116N3kRh]. | Clinical examination of eyelid margins [^113gZopS]. |

---

### Atopic dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis presents with **chronic, pruritic, erythematous, scaly eyelid skin**, often in patients with a personal or family history of atopy [^112SfK1i]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by history and examination [^112SfK1i].

---

### Rosacea

Rosacea is a **chronic inflammatory dermatosis** with periorbital erythema, telangiectasia, and ocular involvement (ocular rosacea) [^115FEToq]. Diagnosis is clinical, with characteristic findings on examination [^115FEToq].

---

### Infectious etiologies

- **Preseptal cellulitis**: Infection of eyelid tissues anterior to the orbital septum; often due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species [^113od1RP].
- **Orbital cellulitis**: Infection posterior to the orbital septum; associated with proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and vision changes [^116asCNT].
- **Herpes zoster ophthalmicus**: Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve; vesicular rash on the forehead and eyelids [^116asCNT].

---

### Drug-induced periorbital redness

Prostaglandin analogs (e.g. bimatoprost, latanoprost) can cause **periorbital erythema**, conjunctival hyperemia, and eyelid changes [^114NjnKt] [^116oQZwS]. Antibiotic eye drops (e.g. ofloxacin) may cause local irritation, erythema, and conjunctival hyperemia [^113S9T12] [^114aonbX].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical history

Characterize the **onset and duration** (acute, chronic, recurrent), and elicit exposures to cosmetics, skincare products, topical medications, and environmental allergens [^116NxeaG]. Screen for associated symptoms — pruritus, pain, discharge, vision changes, and systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) — and review medical history for atopy, rosacea, recent infections, and medication use [^112SfK1i] [^115FEToq].

---

### Physical examination

Inspect the eyelids and periorbital skin for erythema, edema, scaling, vesicles, crusting, and telangiectasia. Perform an ocular examination assessing conjunctival injection, discharge, **corneal involvement**, visual acuity, extraocular movements, and **proptosis** [^116asCNT]. Look for systemic signs such as **fever**, lymphadenopathy, and sinus tenderness [^116TyHyn].

---

### Diagnostic tests

Use **patch testing** when allergic contact dermatitis is suspected [^116N3kRh]. Order laboratory tests (CBC, cultures, serology) if infection or systemic disease is suspected. Obtain imaging (CT/MRI) for suspected orbital cellulitis or deep infections [^112nzArr].

---

## Management strategies

### Allergic contact dermatitis

- **Avoidance**: Identify and avoid offending allergens [^113ZaJ1Q].
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Low-potency agents for short-term use [^112DydqR].
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus for steroid-sparing maintenance [^113nmeXP].
- **Patient education**: Allergen avoidance and skincare measures [^113nmeXP].

---

### Blepharitis

- **Eyelid hygiene**: Regular lid margin cleansing and warm compresses [^notfound].
- **Topical antibiotics**: Erythromycin or bacitracin ointment for bacterial blepharitis [^notfound].
- **Oral antibiotics**: Tetracyclines for severe or refractory cases [^notfound].

---

### Infectious etiologies

Treat preseptal cellulitis with **oral antibiotics** (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, clindamycin) [^1163rR7h]. Orbital cellulitis requires hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, and urgent ophthalmology consultation [^113gZopS] [^111NsXZf]. For herpes zoster ophthalmicus, initiate antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir) and urgent ophthalmology referral [^notfound].

---

### Drug-induced periorbital redness

Drug-induced periorbital redness is managed by **discontinuing the offending medication** and substituting alternatives [^113nmeXP]. Provide supportive care with lubricating eye drops and topical corticosteroids for inflammation [^113nmeXP].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated periorbital redness can lead to **chronic inflammation** with persistent discomfort and cosmetic concerns. Infectious etiologies may progress to vision-threatening complications (corneal ulceration, optic neuropathy) [^111yakDY]. Chronic inflammation can cause eyelid scarring, ectropion, and visual impairment. Psychological distress from cosmetic disfigurement and chronic symptoms is common.

---

## When to refer to a specialist

Urgent ophthalmology referral is indicated for **vision changes, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, severe pain, or suspected orbital cellulitis** [^111NsXZf]. Dermatology referral is appropriate for suspected allergic contact dermatitis, chronic dermatitis, or refractory cases [^115JLW1Q]. Infectious disease consultation is warranted for severe or atypical infections.

---

Periorbital redness has a broad differential, but a focused history, exam, and targeted testing enable accurate diagnosis and management. Prompt recognition of serious causes and cause-specific therapy are essential to prevent complications and restore ocular health.

## References

### Periorbital dermatitis in 4779 patients-patch test results during a 10-year period [^113ZaJ1Q]. Contact Dermatitis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The thinness of the periorbital skin may facilitate allergen penetration, making this area particularly susceptible to sensitization.

Material and Methods

For the cross-sectional study, data were collected by the 57 participating centres of the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology. A total of 101403 patients patch tested between January 2001 and December 2010 were included. Of these, 4779 patients suffered from periorbital dermatitis.

Results

Two major subgroups with different general epidemiological data and sensitization to specific allergens have to be considered: (i) young females with increased rates of skin atopy and allergies, particularly from cosmetic and skin care products; and (ii) older subjects with allergy to topical medications. The prevalence of sensitization to ophthalmic allergens is generally less than that to environmental allergens.

Conclusions

Allergic contact dermatitis is a leading cause of periorbital dermatitis. Patch testing should be considered in all patients with periorbital dermatitis when contact allergy is suspected, in order to identify and avoid offending allergens.

### Periorbital swelling: the important distinction between allergy and infection [^1151svaZ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Orbital cellulitis and abscess formation are rare complications of sinusitis, however acute orbital inflammation is secondary to sinusitis in about 70% of cases. Delay in diagnosis must not occur to avoid serious complications such as blindness and life threatening intracranial sepsis. A case is reported in which despite late referral, emergency surgical intervention was sight saving.

### A surgeon's legal liability of compensation for blindness after periorbital fat grafts [^111wWzih]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

We introduce a case of blindness after a periorbital fat graft and its resulting court ruling in regard to a surgeon's liability of compensation. A 19-year-old woman received an injection of preserved autologous fat to her nasal dorsum. During the injections, she complained of pain and lost vision of her right eye. The pupil responded to light but showed a blepharoptosis and a limitation of the extraocular muscle of her right eye. Upon a fundoscopy, a cherry red spot was observed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography showed an acute infarction of the ophthalmic nerve. Upon an angio-computed tomography, the ophthalmic artery branch was not visualized. Her right eye remained blind 3 weeks after admission. She claimed compensation for damage from the surgeon. The court determined a ruling in favor of the plaintiff (patient); however, the responsibility was limited to 70%. As a result, the defendant has to pay 84,750 US$ to the patient and 6450 US$ to her parents. Roe (the presiding judge) stated that in this case, the injected autologous fat seems to have been put into the ophthalmic artery and the central retinal artery along the vascular countercurrent because of excessive applied pressure. The court also said that because the plaintiff had a history of rhinoplasty, the defendant should have injected the fat more slowly at low pressure to avoid the vascular injury. We think there is a question about "how slowly and how low the pressure should be" for the fat injection. A further study of injection pressure, particle size, temperature, and release in the amount of fat for safe, periorbital, fat grafts should follow this study.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid [^116TyHyn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The swollen red eyelid is a common presentation in primary care. An understanding of the anatomy of the orbital region can guide care. Factors that guide diagnosis and urgency of care include acute vs. subacute onset of symptoms, presence or absence of pain, identifiable mass within the eyelid vs. diffuse lid swelling, and identification of vision change or ophthalmoplegia. Superficial skin processes presenting with swollen red eyelid include vesicles of herpes zoster ophthalmicus; erythematous irritation of contact dermatitis; raised, dry plaques of atopic dermatitis; and skin changes of malignancies, such as basal or squamous cell carcinoma. A well-defined mass at the lid margin is often a hordeolum or stye. A mass within the midportion of the lid is commonly a chalazion. Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are important to identify, treat, and differentiate from each other. Orbital cellulitis is more often marked by changes in ability of extraocular movements and vision as opposed to preseptal cellulitis where these characteristics are classically normal. Less commonly, autoimmune processes of the orbit or ocular tumors with mass effect can create an initial impression of a swollen eyelid.

### Angioedema masqueraders [^114E7WZ2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is a common reason for referral to immunology and allergy specialists. Not all cases are in fact angioedema. There are many conditions that may mimic its appearance, resulting in misdiagnosis. This may happen when a clinician is unfamiliar with conditions resembling angioedema or when there is a low index of clinical suspicion. In this article, we explore a list of differential diagnoses based on body parts, including the lips, the limbs, periorbital tissues, the face, epiglottis and uvula, as well as the genitalia, that may pose as a masquerader even to an experienced eye.

### Systemic amyloidosis caused by monoclonal immunoglobulins: soft tissue and vascular involvement [^114NXHWw]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of soft tissue amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis include macroglossia, arthropathy, muscle pseudohypertrophy, skin plaques, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Vascular manifestations of AL amyloid include periorbital ecchymosis, jaw or limb claudication, and even myocardial infarction caused by occlusion of small vessel coronary arteries. Some of these features, such as macroglossia, periorbital ecchymosis, and the so-called shoulder-pad sign, are pathognomonic for AL amyloidosis. These findings may be the initial presenting features of the disease, and the recognition of these red flag symptoms is very important for the diagnosis and early intervention on the underlying plasma cell disease.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^113bxXRu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotations to algorithm — symptoms suggestive of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) include listed prominent symptoms, and specific red flags require urgent evaluation. Prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, facial or dental pain, headache, throat clearing, and cough. Any patient with orbital swelling or pain, swelling of the forehead, and/or diplopia should be urgently evaluated.

### Recurrent periorbital cellulitis: an unusual clinical entity [^115ghecw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To discuss the cause and management of recurrent periorbital cellulitis (RPOC).

Study Design

Retrospective case series and review of literature.

Materials and Methods

In the past 11 years, we have treated 6 patients for recurrent periorbital cellulitis (RPOC). Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 3 episodes of periorbital cellulitis (POC) within a 1-year period, with interval convalescence lasting at least 1 month. All patients were followed for at least 1 year after resolution.

Results

The causes of RPOC were as follows: (1) 2 patients developed RPOC attributed to environmental allergies; (2) 1 was diagnosed with underlying recurrent sinusitis resistant to medical management with resolution attained through surgery; (3) 1 patient with vesicular RPOC was diagnosed with herpetic RPOC and treated medically with antiviral therapy; (4) 1 patient had allergic contact dermatitis from cosmetic make-up use; and (5) 1 patient was suspected of malingering via repeat subcutaneous self-injection of an irritant.

Conclusions

Although periorbital cellulitis is a commonly encountered and treatable condition, recurrent periorbital cellulitis is rare and may be challenging to manage. In our experience, the causes of recurrence varied, but resolution was achieved by identifying the underlying cause through continuous clinical reassessment and by appropriate medical or surgical management.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112MAxKs]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis Preferred Practice Pattern — disease definition, patient population, and objectives describe that blepharitis is a chronic ocular inflammation that involves the eyelid margin primarily and is a common cause of chronic ocular irritation. The patient population includes individuals of all ages who present with symptoms and signs suggestive of blepharitis, such as eyelid and ocular irritation and redness. Clinical objectives include establishing the diagnosis of blepharitis, differentiating it from other causes of irritation and redness; identifying the type of blepharitis; establishing appropriate therapy; relieving discomfort and pain; preventing complications; and educating and engaging the patient in the management of this potentially chronic disease.

### Case series of post-purpuric darkness on the periorbital area after aesthetic surgery [^116nHcNF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common condition encountered in dermatology practice. POH is caused by various exogenous and endogenous factors including excessive pigmentation, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to eczema, periorbital edema, excessive vascularity, and aging. Recently, we have experienced several patients who complained of POH with an unusual pattern. Their pigmented lesions had several features in common. The pigmentation occurred bilaterally after aesthetic surgery involving the periorbital region. Periorbital post-purpuric darkness should be distinguished from common POH. Practitioners should ask patients about history of prior aesthetic surgery and make their patients aware that the dark colors are composed of various pigments such as hemosiderin, which make treatment troublesome. Conservative management with expectations for gradual spontaneous regression or laser therapy with multiple wavelengths including 1,064-nm laser for PIH and 650 or 694-nm laser targeting heme-derived pigments may be considered as treatment options.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^111f3e9f]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis — provider and setting guidance notes that diagnosis and management require broad medical skills because systemic conditions, including cancer, may be associated with eyelid inflammation, and a multidisciplinary approach with a dermatologist, allergist, or oculoplastic specialist can be helpful. Patients, particularly children, with blepharitis should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist when any of the following are present: visual loss, moderate or severe pain, or severe or chronic redness.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^114i422g]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

2004 Brown grading system for hypersensitivity reactions — Mild reactions are signs and symptoms limited to the skin, such as generalized erythema, urticaria, periorbital edema, or angioedema. Moderate reactions include signs and symptoms suggesting respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal involvement, such as dyspnea, stridor, dizziness (presyncope), diaphoresis, chest or throat tightness, or abdominal pain. Severe reactions are signs and symptoms reflective of hypoxia, hypotension, and/or neurologic compromise, such as cyanosis or oxygen saturation ≤ 92%, hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg in adults), confusion, collapse, altered level of consciousness, or incontinence.

### A data-driven approach for the discovery of biomarkers associated with thyroid eye disease [^114wWq9n]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

In TED, tissues around the eye are attacked, leading to inflammation and swelling, which causes redness and pain, puffiness around the eyes, erythema, conjunctivitis, proptosis, and upper eyelid retraction. Environmental factors like smoking and radioactive iodine are more predisposed to TED. There are many other factors but smoking has a major influence. Smoking induces thyroid functional changes, like a decrease or increase in thyroid hormones and also the risk of thyroid cancer. Like thyroid disease, women are more vulnerable to TED than males with the female to male ratio of 4:1. Immune cells attack the periorbital tissues that lead to the expansion of eye muscles or fat. Hyperthyroidism leads to an overactive thyroid gland, i.e. more secretion of TSH. The TSH helps to maintain body metabolism, and it's over secretion develops several consequences like high blood pressure, fatigue, weight loss, and irritabilitye. Further, autoimmune cells attack the enlarged thyroid gland as well as eye muscles and periorbital tissue. These tissues contain proteins that appear similar to the thyroid gland, like thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R), target as immune assault. The progressive eye swelling may trigger acute pressure inside the eye socket, pressure-pain which worsens movements of the eye, decreased vision when swollen tissues push on the optic nerve.

### Delayed onset purpura following periorbital vessel removal with a long-pulsed Nd: YAG laser [^1167XLvq]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The skin around the eyes is the thinnest, making it especially prone to early signs of aging. Skin laxity, wrinkles, dark circles, periorbital vessels, and pigmentation are frequent complaints among patients. Minimally invasive procedures, including various topicals, fillers, botulinum toxin, lasers, radiofrequency devices, and chemical peels, can be used to rejuvenate the periorbital region.

A common complaint of patients is the presence of prominent periorbital vessels. Treatments such as sclerotherapy, surgical excision, and electrosurgery may be employed, but given the proximity to critical structures and possible complications, these modalities are used sparingly nowadays.

The theory of selective photothermolysis allows the use of vascular specific lasers as a safe and effective treatment option. Generally, periorbital vessels can be targeted using the pulsed dye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate laser, and neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser to target hemoglobin in red blood cells. The desired clinical endpoint is vessel disappearance or a temporary graying/darkening of these vessels. While these lasers are increasingly recognized for effectively treating periorbital veins, more research is needed to fully establish their safety and develop guidelines for their use and aftercare in this specific area.

One of the most important considerations when treating periorbital veins is proper eye protection using ocular shields. Skin cooling is essential to minimize thermal damage of unintended chromophores. However, excessive cooling can cause vasoconstriction, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the treatment. Typically, 1–3 treatment sessions are needed to achieve optimal results, with at least 4–6 weeks between sessions. Some patients may experience mild discomfort, redness, swelling, or immediate purpura following treatment.

Here, we report for the first time, a case series of a previously unreported adverse side effect of delayed onset purpura occurring months following treatment of periorbital vessels with a 1064 nm vascular laser.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of LATISSE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions include dry skin of the eyelid and/or periocular area, eye swelling, eyelid edema, hordeolum, hypersensitivity (local allergic reactions), lacrimation increased, madarosis and trichorrhexis (temporary loss of a few lashes to loss of sections of eyelashes, and temporary eyelash breakage, respectively), periorbital and lid changes associated with periorbital fat atrophy and skin tightness resulting in deepening of eyelid sulcus and eyelid ptosis, rash (including macular and erythematous), skin discoloration (periorbital), skin exfoliation of the eyelid and/or periorbital area, trichiasis, and vision blurred.

6.1 Clinical Trial s Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In a 12-month clinical study with bimatoprost ophthalmic solutions 0.01%, the most common adverse reaction was conjunctival hyperemia (31%). Approximately 1.6% of patients discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia. Other adverse drug reactions (reported in 1 to 4% of patients) with LUMIGAN 0.01% in this study included conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, erythema of eyelid, eyelids pruritus, growth of eyelashes, hypertrichosis, instillation site irritation, punctate keratitis, skin hyperpigmentation, vision blurred, and visual acuity reduced.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of LUMIGAN 0.01%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to LUMIGAN, or a combination of these factors include: asthma-like symptoms, dizziness, dry eye, dyspnea, eye discharge, eye edema, foreign body sensation, headache, hypersensitivity including signs and symptoms of eye allergy and allergic dermatitis, hypertension, lacrimation increased, periorbital and lid changes associated with periorbital fat atrophy leading to skin tightness, deepening of the eyelid sulcus, eyelid ptosis, enophthalmos, and eyelid retraction; and photophobia.

### Not just pink eye: allergic contact dermatitis to alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution [^1122Dp3Y]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Periorbital dermatitis is frequently due to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and patients describe symptoms of swelling, itch, and redness on the eyelids and surrounding skin. Common causative allergens include metals, preservatives, fragrances, and acrylates, whereas common sources include cosmetics and other personal care products, jewellery and nail products. Additionally, allergens in topical medications, mainly eye drops and antibiotics, have been recognised as important precipitants of periorbital ACD.

Results: Among mAIDs (162 pts), TRAPS was diagnosed in 28 (17.3%). The age of the onset ranged from 1 month of life to 28 years, Me 4.0 [IQR 1.0;7.1] y.o. The majority of pts started to hurt before the age of 10 (89.3%), of them up to a year - 8 (28.6%), from 1 to 5 years – 25%, older than 18 years – 2 (7.1%), at the age of 21 and 28. At the time of the study the duration of the disease and the delay in diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 59 years. The diagnosis was made within 1 year of the disease in 4 (14.3%), ranging from 1 to 10 years in 18 (64.3%), a delay in diagnosis of more than 10 years was in 8 (28.6%), more than 20 years in 4 (14.3%). The duration of attacks ranged from 10 to 30 days, the intervals between seizures ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months. Clinical manifestations included most often: fever – 96.4% of pts, skin rashes - 71.4% (annular in 9, erythema in 6, urticaria in 2), musculoskeletal symptoms - 64.3% (among them oligoarthritis in 9, polyarthritis in 2), gastrointestinal symptoms - 64.3% (more often abdominal pain), lymphadenopathy of various groups (cervical, intra-thoracic, mesenteric lymph nodes) - 35.7%, ophthalmological manifestations - 28.6% (more often periorbital edema-5 and eye redness-5). Less frequently observed: manifestations from the nervous system (headaches, dizziness, fatigue, convulsions) in 6 pts, pharyngitis - in 4, stomatitis - in 2. An increase in ESR was noted in 82.1% pts, CRP-71.4%, leukocytosis - 39.3%. The diagnosis in all pts was confirmed genetically. 10 pts had a low-penetrant mutation R92Q (p. Arg121Gln). 5 family cases were identified, the total number of sick family members was 12, from 2 to 4 in each family, 3 cases of amyloidosis, all adults. Treatment included: GC-19 (67.9%), cyclosporine A - 1, colchicine-5. IL-1 inhibitor (canakinumab) was prescribed to 10 pts (35.7%), duration of administration was from 1 to 9 years; etanercept-1, adalimumab-1, tocilizumab-3.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid… [^115JLW1Q]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

7 Patients with irritant contact dermatitis may have pruritus, burning, or stinging of the eyelids and periorbital area, with or without involvement of the face and hands. 1 Examination may reveal a combination of erythema, edema, and vesiculation in patients with acute dermatitis, or scaling and desquamation if inflammation has been present for weeks 2. If the causative agent is not apparent after taking the history and performing the physical examination, referral to an allergist or dermatologist for patch testing may uncover an occult allergen. Preseptal and Orbital Cellulitis Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are infections of the eyelid or orbital tissue that present with eyelid erythema and edema. Although these conditions are less common causes of eyelid edema than contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis, immediate recognition and treatment are critical to prevent vision loss and other serious complications, such as meningitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Physical examination is key to differentiating between preseptal and orbital cellulitis. Although both conditions may present with eyelid edema and erythema, orbital cellulites presents with additional signs and symptoms, including proptosis, decreased visual acuity, pain with eye movement, limitation of extraocular movements, and afferent papillary defect. 38, 39. 31 Eyelid involvement can manifest as acneiform eruptions of the lids, periorbital edema and erythema, telangiectasia of the lid margins, and variably thickened and irregular eyelids. 1, 43, 44 Treatment consists of eyelid hygiene, systemic tetracyclines, 45 topical metronidazole, 46 or 15% azelaic acid gel.

SYSTEMIC DISORDERS Systemic disorders such as myxedema, renal disease, congestive heart failure, and superior vena cava syndrome may manifest with periorbital edema. Generalized or regional edema as well as other signs and symptoms consistent with each respective disease should also be apparent. A periocular "heliotrope rash" may be the initial presenting sign of dermatomyositis, an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.

1 Case Reports

Patient 1 (64‐year‐old female) with a history of Sjögren's syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis sicca and corneal scar of the left eye presented with a 4‐year history of intermittent periorbital redness and swelling (Figure 1a). Patient 2 (50‐year‐old female) with a history of Sjögren's syndrome presented with a 4‐month history of recurrent eyelid dermatitis described as itchy, scaly and red. Patient 3 (38‐year‐old female) with a history of bilateral retinal lattice degeneration and prior retinal surgeries presented with a 6‐month history of recurrent periorbital dermatitis associated with itching, swelling and conjunctival injection (Figure 1c). All patients were using alcaftadine 0.25% solution (Lastacaft) drops and other eye care products for several months to years (Table 1). Patch testing was performed using a standard technique with Finn Chambers (SmartPractice, Phoenix) on Scanpor tape (Norgesplaster Alpharma AS Vennesla, Norway) and included the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) screening series, an expanded cosmetic series, and custom patches to the patients' eye drops and relevant eye care products. The skin was gently scratched prior to the application of eyedrops as previously described. All three patients tested positive (+, Figure 1b, d) to Lastacaft (ingredients: benzalkonium chloride, edetate disodium, monobasic sodium phosphate, purified water, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid) and negative to benzalkonium chloride and other eye products at days 4 and 5 (Table 1). Of the two patients with clinical follow‐up, both showed improvement with discontinuation of Lastacaft drops.

### Topical ophthalmic agents as allergens in periorbital dermatitis [^115fzYFr]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic contact dermatitis is a leading cause of periorbital dermatitis. The extremely thin nature of the periorbital skin may facilitate allergen penetration, making this area particularly susceptible to allergic contact sensitisation. In this study, we assessed sensitisation rates to ingredients of common topical ophthalmic agents.

Materials and Methods

Data collected by 57 participating centres of the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) were analysed retrospectively. Of the 101,403 patients patch tested between January 2001 and December 2010, 4779 patients suffered from periorbital dermatitis and 1158 patients were specifically tested to the ophthalmic tray. Patch test results of the latter group were analysed in detail.

Results

The ophthalmic tray consisted of seven preservatives, six antibiotics and three other ophthalmic agents. Antibiotics (gentamicin, neomycin, kanamycin) were the leading group of allergens. Patch testing with preservatives often elicited irritant or weak positive reactions.

Conclusions

When suspecting contact allergy in the periorbital area, patch testing should be considered in order to identify and avoid offending allergens. Testing to substances from a standardised ophthalmic tray is recommended, but it is preferable to test the actual drops or creams since many chemicals that are present in ophthalmics are not available as commercial test allergens. Given their wide use, preservatives cannot be regarded as common allergens, while antibiotics cause more often true allergic reactions necessitating a long-term avoidance.

### The mydriatic red eye as the initial presentation of syphilis [^114d2c44]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that has been increasing in prevalence since the early 2000s. Ocular involvement occurs in a minority of patients and must be in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with red eye and uveitis.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painful, mydriatic red eye. Review of systems revealed a rash as well as a recent genital lesion and, on further questioning, she admitted to a history of intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual activity. Ophthalmology was consulted and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral uveitis. Serologic testing was positive for syphilis, and she was admitted and treated with intravenous penicillin, with resolution of her uveitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Red eye is a common ocular symptom in patients presenting to the emergency department. The differential diagnosis of the red eye is broad and can range from benign etiologies, such as conjunctivitis, to life- and sight-threatening conditions, such as endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic diseases such as syphilis may present with primarily ocular symptoms, and ocular syphilis must be identified and managed appropriately to prevent devastating sequelae.

### A rare cause for recurrent implant-related inflammation of orbit: dacryocystitis [^112RMexk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Ultra-thin porous polyethylene has been widely preferred in orbital blow out fracture repair for many years as a safe and stable material. Delayed complications related to the implant in orbital blow out fracture repair are very rare and usually begin as a periorbital inflammation. Infections and tissue reaction to the foreign body are regarded as main causes for implant-related inflammation of which symptoms may vary among the patients and may involve subacute and chronic eyelid swelling, skin redness, pain, conjunctival injection, proptosis, and acute orbital inflammation. Presented here is a patient of recurrent periorbital inflammation who underwent orbital floor repair with ultra-thin porous polyethylene sheet which was complicated by dacryocystitis in the late follow-up period.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^1177uSqT]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Inflammation involving the ocular surface

Episcleritis or scleritis is usually anterior (visible when the eye is wide open). Any persistent redness or irregularity of visible sclera should be referred for an ophthalmic opinion, particularly if associated with discomfort.
Phlyctenulosis describes an inflamed nodule on the conjunctiva often abutting the limbal cornea, associated with a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction to Mtb. Lesions may advance over the cornea causing scarring.
Corneal inflammation may occur deeper, in the stroma (interstitial keratitis) or adjacent sclera (sclerokeratitis).

Inflammation of the orbit

Orbital and periorbital disease is usually acquired by haematogenous or lymphatic spread and more rarely by direct spread from skin inoculation or the paranasal sinuses. Presentations include:

Eyelid or periorbital cutaneous TB (lupus vulgaris).
Lacrimal gland and sac involvement.
Bone involvement.
Inflammatory masses within the orbit. Patients may present with pain, proptosis, diplopia or reduced vision secondary to compressive optic neuropathy. Orbital biopsy may be required to exclude malignancy.

### Periorbital (eyelid) dermatides [^111XWQFZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Physicians in various specialties-and dermatologists in particular-frequently encounter various forms of inflammation of the eyelids and of the anterior surface of the eye. Distinguishing the cause of itchy, painful, red, edematous eyelids is often difficult. Because the uppermost layer of the eyelids is part of the skin that wraps the entire body, almost every skin disease in the textbook can affect the periorbital area as well. In this contribution, we focused on the most common such disorders that require special consideration, as a result of their special appearance, their challenging diagnosis, or the nature of their treatment. We reviewed the key features of several common dermatides that affect the eyelids, such as atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, airborne contact dermatitis, rosacea, psoriasis, and others. We focused on the special clinical features, causes, and treatments specific to the delicate skin of the eyelids. Because structures of the eye itself (i.e., the conjunctiva, the cornea, the lens, and the retina) may be involved in some of the discussed periorbital skin diseases, we found it useful to add a brief summary of the eyelid complications of those diseases. We then briefly reviewed some acute sight-threatening and even life-threatening infections of the eyelids, although dermatologists are not likely to be the primary care physicians responsible for treating them.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^112DydqR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids — adverse effects and monitoring: The incidence of adverse events with TCS is low, and although they are associated with cutaneous side effects (purpura, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, focal hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, striae), skin atrophy is generally the most concerning. Risk factors for atrophy include higher potency TCS use, occlusion, use on thinner and intertriginous skin, older patient age, and long-term continuous use. Allergic contact dermatitis to TCS or excipients can be determined via patch testing. Two systematic reviews deemed the strength of evidence regarding Topical Steroid Addiction (TSA) and Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW) to be too low to very low, and the most consistent risk factor associated with TSA/TSW is prolonged, inappropriate use of potent topical steroids on the face or in intertriginous areas. Red face syndrome and red scrotum syndrome may occur after prolonged TCS use. Noncutaneous side effects with TCS are rare; an association with cataracts or glaucoma is unclear, but minimizing periorbital steroid use is advised. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression can occur with prolonged, continuous use of high potency TCS on large surface areas (especially with other corticosteroid forms) and can be assessed via a cortisol stimulation test; associations with type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis have been described but warrant further exploration.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid [^113gZopS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of eyelid erythema and edema is broad, ranging from benign, self-limiting dermatoses to malignant tumors and vision-threatening infections. A definitive diagnosis usually can be made on physical examination of the eyelid and a careful evaluation of symptoms and exposures. The finding of a swollen red eyelid often signals cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis is a severe infection presenting with proptosis and ophthalmoplegia; it requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics to prevent vision loss. Less serious conditions, such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and blepharitis, are more common causes of eyelid erythema and edema. These less serious conditions can often be managed with topical corticosteroids and proper eyelid hygiene. They are differentiated on the basis of such clinical clues as time course, presence or absence of irritative symptoms, scaling, and other skin findings. Discrete lid lesions are also important diagnostic indicators. The finding of vesicles, erosions, or crusting may signal a herpes infection. Benign, self-limited eyelid nodules such as hordeola and chalazia often respond to warm compresses, whereas malignancies require surgical excision.

### Periorbital dermatitis – a recalcitrant disease: causes and differential diagnoses [^111NCfsK]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Periorbital dermatitis is common and frequently recalcitrant to treatment. Due to the exposed and visible location, patients often suffer severely from periorbital dermatitis.

Objectives

To determine the frequency and causes of periorbital dermatitis including contact sensitizers.

Methods

We investigated two cohorts of patients (Erlangen and IVDK without Erlangen) between 1999 and 2004.

Results

The differences between the two cohorts with periorbital dermatitis [Department of Dermatology at University Hospital Erlangen (n = 88) and the German Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) collective (n = 2035)] were determined by the MOAHLFA (male, occupational dermatosis, atopic eczema, hand dermatitis, leg dermatitis, facial dermatitis, age ≥ 40 years) index. Statistically significant factors for periocular eczema are female sex, atopic skin diathesis and age ≥ 40 years. In both cohorts allergic contact dermatitis was the main cause of periorbital eczema (Erlangen 44.3%, IVDK 31.6%), followed by periorbital atopic dermatitis (Erlangen 25%, IVDK 14.1%), airborne dermatitis (Erlangen 10.2%, IVDK 1.9%), irritant contact dermatitis (Erlangen 9.1%, IVDK 7.6%), periorbital rosacea (Erlangen 4.5%, IVDK 2.2%), allergic conjunctivitis (Erlangen 2.3%, IVDK included in 'others') and psoriasis (Erlangen 2.3%, IVDK included in 'others'). The most relevant allergens/allergen sources inducing periorbital eczema were consumers' products (facial cream, eye shadow and ophthalmic therapeutics) (31%), fragrance mix (19%), balsam of Peru (10%), thiomersal (10%) and neomycin sulphate (8%); 12.5% of patients with allergic periocular dermatitis could be exclusively elucidated by testing patients' own products.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate the multiplicity of causes for periorbital eczematous disease manifestation, which requires patch testing of standard trays as well as consumers' products to elucidate the relevant contact sensitization.

### Periorbital contact sensitization [^112j7yFj]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify frequency and pattern of contact sensitization among patients with periorbital dermatitis.

Design

Cross-sectional retrospective investigation of 1247 patients referred for patch testing over a 17-year period.

Methods

Data were collected for patients undergoing patch testing to the standard and customized trays between January 1990 and December 2006 at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Contact Dermatitis Clinic. Our study group consisted of 266 patients affected by periorbital dermatitis. Findings were compared to 981 referrals without periorbital dermatitis (controls). Patch test results were read after 48 and 72 hours and classified as allergic, questionable, irritant, or negative. Statistical analyses were carried out by using chi(2) test and Fisher exact test.

Results

General epidemiologic data among periorbital dermatitis patients showed significant predominance of female gender (87.6%) and of individuals aged 40 to 59 years (45.9%). Nickel (16.5%) and fragrance mix (13.2%) were the top-ranking sensitizers. Ingredients of topical ophthalmologic products did not result in significant sensitization. Comparison of the periorbital dermatitis group to the controls did not reveal significant differences in sensitization pattern. Patch testing confirmed the likelihood of allergic contact dermatitis in 50.8% of the periorbital dermatitis patients tested.

Conclusions

Allergic contact dermatitis is a common cause of periorbital dermatitis. Patch testing should be considered in all patients with periorbital dermatitis when suspecting contact allergy in order to identify and avoid offending allergens.

### A case of a 15-month-old with periorbital edema and severe anemia [^113m7soA]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

This is the case of a previously healthy 15-month-old girl who initially presented to her primary pediatrician with a 2-week history of intermittent periorbital edema. The edema had improved by the time of the visit, and a urine specimen was unable to be obtained in the clinic. A routine fingerstick demonstrated anemia to 8.8 mg/dL, so the patient was started on ferrous sulfate. She then returned to the emergency department 1 month later with severe periorbital edema and pallor but no other significant symptoms. On physical examination, she was tachycardic with striking periorbital edema and an otherwise normal physical examination. She was noted to have a severe microcytic anemia (hemoglobin of 3.9 mg/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 53.1 fL) and hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 1.9 g/dL and total protein of 3.3 g/dL). The remainder of her electrolytes and liver function test results were within normal limits. A urinalysis was sent, which was negative for protein. Our panel of experts reviews her case to determine a unifying diagnosis for both her severe anemia and her hypoalbuminemia.

In patients suspected of ACD, patch testing is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. In addition to personal products used by a patient suspected of ACD, review the home and workplace for other sources of contact allergens [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; D Evidence]. Evaluate patients for both irritant and allergic causes, especially in those presenting with hand dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected and evaluated in the patient with both generalized and anatomically localized skin eruptions (such as the hands, face, eyelids) that come in contact with the substances in the environment [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. In a patient with a facial rash involving the periorbital area (eg, eyelids), evaluate for ACD caused by components of cosmetics, such as fragrances, preservatives, and excipients, because these are common sensitizers of the facial skin [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence].

### Pediatric trochleitis associated with paranasal sinusitis: a case report [^115E4UCK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Trochleitis is trochlear pain with evidence of inflammation in the trochlear area on radiologic examination. The etiology of trochleitis is mostly idiopathic. Secondary trochleitis is rare, and trochleitis associated with paranasal sinusitis in children has not yet been reported.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old boy presented with left periorbital pain for a week. His visual acuity and eye movement were normal. There was point tenderness on palpitation over the left trochlear region without swelling or redness. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed focal enhancement on the left trochlea and paranasal sinusitis on the left side. The patient's symptoms and signs were completely resolved after empirical treatment for sinusitis. There was no need to inject a local steroid.

Conclusion

Although rare, sinusitis should be considered when diagnosing and treating trochleitis in children with periorbital pain.

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of electrocoagulation at low voltages in treating periorbital syringomas.

Materials and Methods

Twenty cases were collected during the period of 2002 through 2005. All cases were photographed before treatment with a dual-frequency 4-MHz radiofrequency device (Surgitron, Ellman International, Inc, Hewlett, NY) at a power of 1 to 2 in electrocoagulation mode. Six-week follow-up visits were scheduled to discuss occurrences and expectations, observe treatment effects, and apply further electrosurgery if needed.

Results

Clinical improvement increased with each subsequent treatment session. All patients scored either moderate or marked clinical improvement by their final visits, with 60% (11/18) revealing a marked clinical improvement (i.e., > 70% clearance). The most common encountered adverse effects consisted of periorbital burning, swelling, redness, and pigmentary changes.

Conclusion

Low-voltage electrocoagulation is an effective therapy for periorbital syringoma and should be considered when treating this difficult condition. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing electrocoagulation for removal of syringomas.

### Diffuse orbital inflammation: an atypical manifestation of behcet's disease [^114rVeaw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Behcet's disease is a chronic, relapsing systemic vasculitis characterised by multisystem involvement from small, medium and large vessel inflammation. Common manifestations include oral and genital ulcers, rash, uveitis and neurological symptoms, while orbital inflammation is rare. An Asian man in his 40s with Behcet's disease on immunosuppression presented with 10 days of unilateral periorbital swelling and painful eye movements, unresponsive to oral antibiotics. Imaging revealed diffuse orbital inflammation and optic neuritis. Investigations excluded an infectious cause. Despite broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, his condition worsened until typical Behcet's disease mucocutaneous symptoms emerged, indicating a Behcet's flare. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, followed by cyclophosphamide and azathioprine resolved the diffuse orbital inflammation. Unfortunately, the visual outcome was poor as he remained blind in the affected eye from optic neuritis and corneal ulceration. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of diffuse orbital inflammation in Behcet's disease to prevent severe ocular complications.

### Periorbital erythema as a presenting sign of COVID-19 [^112vWo4f]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
At initial presentation of periorbital dyschromia. (The photograph was obtained via telemedicine visits with consent of the patient.)

Fig 2
At recurrence of periorbital dyschromia. (The photograph was obtained via telemedicine visits with consent of the patient.)

Fig 3
At resolution of periorbital dyschromia. (The photograph was obtained via telemedicine visits with consent of the patient.)

Patient 2 was an otherwise healthy 50-year-old man who developed similar periorbital dyschromia, without any ocular changes, 2 days before onset of systemic symptoms including fever, shortness of breath, myalgias, and syncope. No images were obtained because he was hospitalized for his systemic symptoms of COVID-19 and tested positive for the SARS-CoV2 while he was in the hospital. No creams or ointments were applied for his periorbital dyschromia during his hospitalization, and he reported that the rash resolved on its own, with improvement in the systemic symptoms of COVID-19. As with patient 1, patient 2 reported that he again noticed periorbital dyschromia 2 days before worsening of the systemic symptoms, with recurrence of fever, worsening cough, and shortness of breath after reappearance of the periorbital dyschromia. Periorbital dyschromia once again resolved, with the resolution of systemic symptoms of COVID-19.

### Diagnosis and management of the acute red eye [^111cZfao]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The red eye is one of the most frequent presenting complaints in the emergency department setting. A wide spectrum of disease processes may present as a red eye, ranging from benign self-limiting etiologies to serious vision-threatening ones. The emergency physician must be adept at recognizing "red flags" from the history and physical examination that necessitate immediate treatment and referral. In addition, it is imperative for the emergency physician to recognize the need for immediate versus elective ophthalmologist consultation for the various conditions. This article includes a discussion of the key historical features, clinical presentations, physical examination findings, and management of the more common causes of the red eye.

### Appearances are deceptive [^113TeLzH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 31-year-old man was referred with sudden onset of a painful periorbital angio-oedema. Assuming a first episode of allergic or acquired angio-oedema, the patient was treated with a plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor, tranexamic acid and fresh-frozen plasma, after the initial treatment with corticosteroids and histamine blockers was unsuccessful. As blood cultures grew group A streptococci, the diagnosis of periorbital necrotising fasciitis was made, and treatment was subsequently changed to clindamycin and ceftriaxone. Necrotising fasciitis involving the periorbita is a rare and potentially lethal differential diagnosis of acute angio-oedema, in particular if accompanied by severe pain and/or fever. Knowledge on the appearance of this disorder cannot be overemphasised, as only early recognition and immediate initiation of high-dose penicillin and clindamycin combined with tissue debridement help to decrease the mortality and morbidity.

### Corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis [^111yakDY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are infections of the tissue anterior and posterior to the orbital septum, respectively, and can be difficult to differentiate clinically. Periorbital cellulitis can also progress to become orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis has a relatively high incidence in children and adults, and potentially serious consequences including vision loss, meningitis, and death. Complications occur in part due to inflammatory swelling from the infection creating a compartment syndrome within the bony orbit, leading to elevated ocular pressure and compression of vasculature and the optic nerve. Corticosteroids are used in other infections to reduce this inflammation and edema, but they can lead to immune suppression and worsening infection.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis, and to assess their effectiveness and safety in children and in adults separately.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of participants diagnosed with periorbital or orbital cellulitis. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on participants who were undergoing elective endoscopic surgery, including management of infections postsurgery as well as studies conducted solely on trauma patients. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Any study that administered corticosteroids was eligible regardless of type of steroid, route of administration, length of therapy, or timing of treatment. Comparators could include placebo, another corticosteroid, no treatment control, or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

The search yielded 7998 records, of which 13 were selected for full-text screening. We identified one trial for inclusion. No other eligible ongoing or completed trials were identified. The included study compared the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics to the use of antibiotics alone for the treatment of orbital cellulitis. The study included a total of 21 participants aged 10 years and older, of which 14 participants were randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics and 7 participants to antibiotics alone. Participants randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics received adjunctive corticosteroids after initial antibiotic response (mean 5.13 days), at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg for three days followed by 1 mg/kg for another three days before being tapered over a one- to two-week period. We assessed the included study as having an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, masking (blinding), selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Risk of bias from sequence generation and incomplete outcome data were low. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, downgraded for risk of bias (-1) and imprecision (-2). Length of hospital stay was compared between the group receiving antibiotics alone compared to the group receiving antibiotics and corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to 9.08; 21 participants). There was no observed difference in duration of antibiotics between treatment groups (MD 3.00, 95% CI -0.48 to 6.48; 21 participants). Likewise, preservation of visual acuity at 12 weeks of follow-up between group was also assessed (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 21 participants). Pain scores were compared between groups on day 3 (MD -0.20, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.62; 22 eyes) along with the need for surgical intervention (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.23; 21 participants). Exposure keratopathy was reported in five participants who received corticosteroids and antibiotics and three participants who received antibiotic alone (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.63; 21 participants). No major complications of orbital cellulitis were seen in either the intervention or the control group. No side effects of corticosteroids were reported, although it is unclear which side effects were assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis. Since there is significant variation in how corticosteroids are used in clinical practice, additional high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed to inform decision making. Future studies should explore the effects of corticosteroids in children and adults separately, and evaluate different dosing and timing of corticosteroid therapy.

### Periorbital lesions [^111khot6]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Periorbital lesions are dermatologic manifestations affecting the area around the eyes, excluding the eyelids. They can be classified according to their nature and morphology. Although types of skin disorders affect the periorbital area, only those with a prevalent or prominent location will be mentioned, and clinical descriptions will be confined to the rarer entities. Inflammatory lesions include erythematous and erythematous scaling, eczematous and urticarial lesions, vesicular and bullous lesions, and granulomatous lesions. Purpuras, infections, and infestations may be present as well. Benign and malignant tumors are common. Metabolic disorders include some rare entities, such as mucinosis and amyloidosis, but also commoner manifestations such as xanthelasma. Histiocytosis is rare but does occur in prevalent locations. Hair and pigmentary disorders are common, and aging-related damage is most visible in the periorbital area.

### Late-onset periorbital edema in patients with a history of facial hyaluronic acid injection: a review on diagnosis and management [^114qUQHD]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for soft tissue augmentation, particularly in the facial area, have become increasingly popular. Nevertheless, a growing number of reports indicate complications associated with this procedure, posing challenges for practitioners. One commonly encountered complication is periorbital edema.

Objective

To review the existing literature on late-onset periorbital edema following HA injections, focusing on clinical presentation, proposed mechanisms, risk factors, diagnostics, and management strategies.

Methods

A literature search was conducted to find articles describing findings on malar edema and eyelid edema following HA injections. The gathered data were categorized and juxtaposed to provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon.

Results

Incidence rates of periorbital edema post-HA injection vary, with delayed onset occurring weeks to years later. The manifestation involves diffuse edema in the eyelids and malar area, sometimes worsened by trigger factors like infections. Pathophysiology discussions distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory causes, highlighting lymphatic and venous flow disturbances. Risk factors include filler characteristics, injection depth, and patient predispositions. Proper patient evaluation using ultrasonography aids in treatment planning, which could involve corticosteroids, hyaluronidase for HA removal, and subsequent cosmetic procedures like radiofrequency (RF) microneedling. Surgical interventions should be considered after HA dissolution, especially in cases requiring lower blepharoplasty.

Conclusion

Late periorbital edema post-facial HA injections, once rare, is now frequently seen. Understanding and addressing this complication is essential for optimizing patient care and outcomes in clinical practice. Treatment typically involves adjusting hyaluronidase dosage for HA removal. Additional procedures like blepharoplasty, RF needling, or filler reinjection may enhance post-treatment appearance.

### Avoiding and managing complications in the periorbital area and midface [^1136gcwm]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The eyes play a central role in the perception of facial beauty. The goal of periorbital rejuvenation surgery is to restore youthful proportions and focus attention on the eyes. Blepharoplasty is the third most common cosmetic procedure performed today. Because of the attention placed on the periorbital region, preventing and managing complications is important. Obtaining a thorough preoperative history and physical examination can significantly reduce the incidence of many of the complications. This article focuses on the preoperative evaluation as it relates to preventable complications, followed by common intraoperative and postoperative complications and their management.

### Quantitative assessment of new frontiers in dermatochalasis and periorbital hyperpigmentation treatment: the role of cross-linked porcine collagen [^1151PxTN]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Collagen dermal fillers have shown efficacy in addressing age-related changes in facial appearance. However, their potential in rejuvenating the periorbital region remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, clinical safety, and patient satisfaction associated with the utilization of collagen dermal fillers in individuals with dermatochalasis and periorbital hyperpigmentation.

Methods

This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of China Medical University Hospital (IRB No. CMUH107-REC2–157). Adults diagnosed with dermatochalasis or periorbital hyperpigmentation received periorbital injections of a sterile cross-linked highly-purified specific antigen free porcine dermal collagen (FACIALGAIN® Collagen Implant with Lidocaine, Sunmax Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan) and were assessed for hydration, elasticity, pigmentation index, redness index, lightness value, and density with the DermaLab® Combo Multiparameter Skin Analysis System (Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark) and Cutometer® Dual MPA 580 (Courage+Khazaka electronic GmbH, Köln, Germany). Data was collected prior to injection and at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after injection. Patient satisfaction on volume augmentation, decrease in hyperpigmentation, persistence, and overall satisfaction were also recorded.

Results

A total of 12 samples each were recruited for dermatochalasis and periorbital hyperpigmentation. For dermatochalasis subjects, hydration of the periorbital tissue significantly increased at week 1 and 4 (p = 0.011 and p = 0.015). Elasticity decreased by week 4 and persisted until week 12 (p = 0.001 and 0.014). For periorbital hyperpigmentation patients, lightness value increased significantly starting week 1 (p = 0.016), tapering off at week 12. Elasticity decreased by week 4 and persisted until week 12 (p = 0.002 and p = 0.002). Median overall patient satisfaction was 4 out of 5 for the dermatochalasis group and 4.5 out of 5 for the periorbital hyperpigmentation group, with a mild but insignificant decrease by week 12.

Conclusions

DermaLab® Combo and Cutometer® Dual MPA 580 are considered effective methods for evaluating patients undergoing dermal filler injections. The utilization of cross-linked porcine collagen dermal filler injections can serve as a minimally invasive approach to enhance skin laxity in dermatochalasis and address discoloration in periorbital hyperpigmentation. However, it is important to note that regular treatments may be necessary to sustain the desired outcomes.

### Periorbital edema secondary to imatinib mesylate [^112ALnPk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec((R))) is a well-established pharmacologic treatment for all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia and for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Edema-related side effects are relatively common in imatinib therapy with the periocular skin representing one of the most common sites for localized edema. While the adverse effect of periorbital edema with imatinib is well documented in the oncology literature, there is limited reference to this common reaction in the ophthalmology literature. We report two patients with upper eyelid edema associated with imatinib therapy who required surgical intervention to ameliorate significant visual field obstruction. We highlight the details of each case including the histopathologic findings of excised redundant skin followed by a thorough review of the literature on imatinib related periorbital edema.

### Periorbital erythema as a presenting sign of COVID-19 [^112G92Mb]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reports in literature of the presence of cutaneous findings in patients who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have ranged from 20.4%to 0.2% of cases. Reported cutaneous manifestations span from nonpruritic to pruritic erythematous morbilliform eruptions involving the trunk, to localized or widespread urticaria, to chickenpox-like vesicles. Petechial rash has also been described at the initial presentation of the COVID-19 disease, along with confluent erythematous-yellowish papules on heels bilaterally that presented 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 and which progressed to pruritic, hard, erythematous plaques. The timing of the reported cutaneous manifestations observed has also varied, with some patients presenting with cutaneous findings at the onset of the COVID-19 symptoms, whereas others develop cutaneous involvement after infection has progressed and they have been hospitalized. Herein, we present a novel cutaneous finding, a dusky red, nonpruritic, nonblanching, periorbital dyschromia that we have observed in several patients who have received a diagnosis of COVID-19. This rash appeared before the development of any of the systemic symptoms of COVID-19, and we believe that it can potentially serve as an early sign of patients' developing COVID-19.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^112SfK1i]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) diagnosis — essential features must be present and include pruritus; eczema (acute, subacute, chronic) with typical morphology and age-specific patterns; and chronic or relapsing history, with patterns including facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children, current or previous flexural lesions in any age group, and sparing of the groin and axillary regions. Important features seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis, include early age of onset, atopy with personal and/or family history or immunoglobulin E reactivity, and xerosis. Associated features help to suggest the diagnosis but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting AD for research and epidemiologic studies, and include atypical vascular responses (facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch response), keratosis pilaris/pityriasis alba/hyperlinear palms/ichthyosis, ocular/periorbital changes, other regional findings (perioral changes/periauricular lesions), and perifollicular accentuation/lichenification/prurigo lesions. Exclusionary conditions note that a diagnosis of AD depends on excluding scabies, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic), ichthyoses, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, photosensitivity dermatoses, immune deficiency diseases, and erythroderma of other causes.

### Lagophthalmos as a presenting sign in dermatomyositis with muscle involvement limited to the ocular muscles [^115Un3Y9]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder characterized by cutaneous findings and muscle inflammation. Adult patients with DM without clinically significant muscle involvement are classified as having amyopathic DM (DM sine myositis). Ophthalmologic findings associated with DM commonly include a heliotrope rash, periorbital redness, and periorbital edema. Other findings can include exophthalmos, chemosis, ptosis, retinopathy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus. Lagophthalmos refers to the inability to fully close the eyelids and can cause increased evaporation of the tear film, corneal exposure, corneal ulceration, and exposure keratopathy. There are many etiologies of lagophthalmos, and the most common causes include facial nerve palsy, trauma, surgery, or infection. We present a unique case of bilateral lagophthalmos in DM with muscle involvement limited to the ocular muscles, which later resolved with medical treatment.

### Cellulitis… [^113od1RP]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

DACRYOADENITIS Dacryoadenitis is inflammation of the lacrimal glands, whereas dacryocystitis is inflammation of the lacrimal sac in the inferior lid. 1 Both conditions can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Bacterial infections tend to be tenderer to palpation than viral infections. 1 Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and gram-negative organisms are common pathogens. Clinically, these processes may mimic preseptal cellulitis. Cellulitis Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are infections of the soft tissues of the orbit. The orbital septum separates the preseptal and orbital spaces. 6 Classically, local skin trauma allows infection of the preseptal tissues, whereas extravasation of a sinus infection is associated with infection posterior to the orbital septum. 5, 8, 10, 27 The ethmoid sinus and the wafer-thin lamina papyracea are often the sources of orbital cellulitis. 8, 9, 27 Bacterial superinfection can occur over a viral process.
28.

The most common causes of these infections are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus. 6, 29 Immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type b has substantially reduced the incidence of infection with Haemophilus. 29 Preseptal and orbital cellulitis can present with edema around the orbit, fever, and the patient's report of eye pain. Orbital Mass Effect Painless, slow onset of proptosis of the globe may initially be reported or identified as a swollen eyelid. Palpation of the lid can clarify whether it is edematous or whether there is a proptotic globe. Unilateral proptosis should trigger consideration of an orbital tumor. Bilateral proptosis should trigger consideration of inflammatory processes such as Graves disease. Medication Effects Medications such as glucocorticoids are known to cause periorbital cutaneous inflammation.

13 Other drugs, including allopurinol, cephalosporins, corticosteroids, and valproic acid, have reported associations with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, both of which lead to erythema, edema, and erosions of the eyelid. 13 Dermatology and possible ophthalmology consultations are warranted for aggressive care of these conditions.

### Distinguishing periorbital from orbital cellulitis… [^112nzArr]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Accurate identification of periorbital and orbital cellulitis is essential for appropriate treatment. Givner reviewed the characteristics and treatment of these two clinical entities. Sources of periorbital infection can be trauma, including insect bites, or bacteremia. The resultant cellulitis is preseptal, or anterior to the orbital septum, involving a fibrous layer beginning at the periosteum of the skull and extending to the eyelids. Periorbital cellulitis does not progress to orbital cellulitis because of this protective fibrous barrier. Orbital cellulitis is postseptal and involves the orbit itself. The most common cause is extension of infection from sinusitis, although penetrating trauma causes some cases. The orbit is surrounded by the sinuses. The ethmoid sinus is the most common source of orbital infection because a very thin septum separates it from the orbit.

Generally, orbital cellulitis occurs in older children because sinusitis is more common as children reach the preteen years. Orbital cellulitis can cause bacteremia. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The clinical signs help to distinguish periorbital from orbital cellulitis. Periorbital infection causes erythema, induration, and tenderness of the periorbital tissues, with patients rarely showing signs of systemic illness. The latter signs are more likely if the infection results from bacteremia. Orbital cellulitis may have the same signs and symptoms in the periorbital tissue but also results in proptosis, edema of the conjunctiva, ophthalmoplegia, or decreased visual acuity. Because the eyelids usually are swollen shut, computed tomographic scanning with contrast infusion may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Nearby sinusitis generally is evident.

Although it is associated with orbital cellulitis, periorbital edema can occur without infection, but this condition can be identified by a lack of induration or tenderness. The causative organism is related to the pathogenesis of infection. Post-traumatic periorbital cellulitis usually is caused by. Givner concludes with treatment recommendations. Uncomplicated post-traumatic periorbital cellulitis usually responds to oral antibiotics, such as cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or clindamycin, that treat gram-positive microbes. If there is evidence of bacteremia, the risk of meningitis may require lumbar puncture.

### Periorbital erythema as a presenting sign of COVID-19 [^114KGttz]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV2, has afflicted millions of people worldwide during the past several months. Although there are multiple reports of systemic findings observed in patients with COVID-19, cutaneous manifestations of this disease have not been as widely described. Anecdotal and incidental cutaneous findings associated with COVID-19 have appeared in the literature, but no systematic review of the cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has been composed to date, to our knowledge. Some of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 that have been described in the literature have ranged from erythematous eruptions involving the trunk, to widespread erythema and chickenpox-like vesicles, to rash with petechia, to confluent erythematous-yellowish papules on heels bilaterally that progressed to hard erythematous plaques.

Furthermore, COVID-19 patients seem to be prone to coagulation dysfunction with signs of small blood vessel occlusion, as is evident by systemic, as well as cutaneous, findings of ischemia in the limbs. These cutaneous manifestations of microcirculation disorder that patients with COVID-19 may be developing can clinically present as findings ranging from petechiae or tiny bruises, to nonpruritic blanching livedoid vascular eruptions on extremities, to plantar plaques, plantar vesicles, dry gangrene, or just bruising in the fingers and toes. Perhaps the periocular dyschromia that we have noticed is a part of the coagulation dysfunction affecting the periocular vasculature. Although much more research is needed to evaluate the cutaneous manifestations that accompany COVID-19, herein we present our findings of periorbital dyschromia that presents a few days before the onset of systemic manifestations of COVID-19 and does not have any ocular findings, unlike in other reported studies. We believe that appearance of periorbital dyschromia may serve as an early cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 and as a precursor of the systemic symptoms that seem to follow this presentation.

### Periorbital hyperpigmentation: review of etiology, medical evaluation, and aesthetic treatment [^116Wq8gm]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common worldwide problem. It is challenging to treat, complex in pathogenesis, and lacking straightforward and repeatable therapeutic options. It may occur in the young and old, however the development of dark circles under the eyes in any age is of great aesthetic concern because it may depict the individual as sad, tired, stressed, and old. While "dark circles" are seen in all skin types, POH is often more commonly seen in skin of color patients worldwide. With a shifting US demographic characterized by growing number of aging patients as well as skin of color patients, we will encounter POH with greater frequency. As forecasted by the US Census, by 2030 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 plus years old and greater than 50% of the population will possess ethnic skin of color. The disparity in the medical community's understanding of POH versus popular demand for treatment is best illustrated when you have only 65 cited articles to date indexed on PubMed line compared to the 150,000,000 results on Google search engine. Most importantly POH may be a final common pathway of dermatitis, allergy, systemic disorders, sleep disturbances, or nutritional deficiences that lends itself to medical, surgical, and cosmeceutical treatments. A complete medical history with ROS and physical examination is encouraged prior to treating the aesthetic component. Sun protection is a cornerstone of therapy. Safety issues are of utmost concern when embarking upon treatments such as chemical peeling, filler injection, and laser therapy as not to worsen the pigmentation. Without intervention, POH usually progresses over time so early intervention and management is encouraged. The objective of this study was to review the current body of knowledge on POH, provide the clinician with a guide to the evaluation and treatment of POH, and to present diverse clinical cases of POH that have responded to different therapies including non-ablative fractional photothermolysis in two skin of color patients.

### Periorbital necrotising fasciitis [^111DoPB8]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis involving the periorbita is a devastating infection. Potential outcomes range from severe disfigurement, loss of the eye and even to death. Early recognition is critical, although its initially non-distinctive appearance frequently delays diagnosis and treatment. Herein, the authors have performed a systematic review of previously published cases including clinical features, diagnoses and differential diagnoses, pathological characteristics and management. Periorbital necrotising fasciitis is seen mainly in adults with a female predominance (54%); about one-half (47%) of the patients were previously healthy. The infection can follow local blunt trauma (17%), penetrating injuries (22%) and face surgery (11%), but in about one-third of cases (28%) no cause was identified. Non-specific erythema and localised painful swelling of the eyelids characterise the earliest manifestation of the disease, followed by formation of blisters and necrosis of the periorbital skin and subcutaneous tissues. The causative organism in periorbital infection was mainly β-haemolytic Streptococcus alone (50%), occasionally in combination with Staphylococcus aureus (18%). The overall mortality rate was 14.42%. The main risk factor for mortality was the type of causative organism, since all reported cases of death were caused by β-haemolytic Streptococcus alone or associated with other organisms. Unlike necrotising fasciitis affecting other body sites, there was not a strong correlation with age > 50 years or the presence of associated chronic illness. Management of periorbital necrotising fasciitis is then based on early distinction of symptoms and signs and aggressive multidisciplinary treatment. Thus, the delay between initial debridement and initiating parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be considered the most critical factor influencing morbidity and mortality.

Safety

Mean pain felt during injection was between 20 and 30 mm on the 100 mm VAS for all periorbital indications, indicating mild pain. However, in a few subjects, VAS scores reached 80 mm in the tear trough. By the end of the consultation, pain had decreased for all subjects, with mean VAS scores approaching zero (Table 4).

SD, standard deviation; VAS, Visual Analog Scale

All of the CTRs reported by the investigator immediately after injection were deemed mild or moderate (Table 4). The most frequent reactions in the periorbital region overall were bruising (between 9 and 15%) and swelling (2 and 20%). Of the 116 injections with R2 in the tear trough, 17 (14.7%) resulted in bruising, 9 (7.8%) in swelling, 6 (5.2%) in redness, and 1 (0.9%) in lumps and bumps. Of the 78 injections in the palpebromalar groove, there were 7 (9.0%) cases of bruising, 2 (2.6%) cases of swelling, and 1 (1.3%) case of moderate redness. Out of the 48 injections in the crow's feet, there were 7 (14.6%) cases of lumps and bumps, 5 (10.4%) cases of bruising, 1 (2.1%) case of moderate redness, and 1 (2.1%) case of swelling. Of the 53 outer canthus treatments, 6 (11.3%) resulted in bruising, 1 (1.9%) resulted in redness, 1 (1.9%) resulted in lumps and bumps, and 1 (1.9%) resulted in swelling. Of the 20 injections in the brow, there were 4 (20.0%) cases of swelling, 2 (10.0%) cases of bruising, and 1 (5.0%) case of lumps and bumps.

### Periorbital erythema as a presenting sign of COVID-19 [^113BRsLV]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

Patient 1, an otherwise heathy 43-year-old woman, presented with dusky red, nonpruritic, nonblanching periorbital dyschromia (Fig 1). There was no conjunctivitis, other ocular symptoms, or any systemic findings of COVID-19 reported when the periorbital dyschromia appeared. Two days after the appearance of the rash, the patient reported that she had developed fever, cough, sore throat, muscle weakness, myalgias, and shortness of breath. She was prescribed alclometasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment. She was followed via telemedicine encounters and reported that she subsequently tested positive for the SARS-CoV2. She reported that she was using prescribed ointment twice a day and her rash completely resolved within a few days of using the ointment, along with improvement in her systemic symptoms. After this initial improvement in the systemic symptoms, and approximately 10 days after she developed initial periorbital dyschromia, she again developed the periorbital changes. As before, 2 days after developing periorbital dyschromia, she again became febrile, with worsening cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath, in what appeared to be the second phases of COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature. She requested another telemedicine consultation when the periorbital changes reappeared (Fig 2) and was told to use alclometasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment, which led to complete resolution of periorbital dyschromia (Fig 3). She completely recovered from COVID-19 and no further periorbital dyschromia was observed.

8.3 Management

Effective treatment requires strict avoidance of the causative agent and, if possible, finding alternatives. Emollients are key in maintaining skin barrier integrity and should be routinely used. If contact dermatitis does not respond to standard treatment, topical corticosteroids should be considered, but prolonged use should be avoided. Topical tacrolimus may be an effective alternative. Systemic corticosteroids should be reserved for short‐term use and avoided whenever possible.

### Periorbital rash and scaly plaques in a 13-year-old boy [^111PeFSQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A 13-year–old boy presented with a 6-month history of a pruritic, periorbital, reddish-purple rash (Fig 1, A) and pink-violaceous, noninfiltrated papules and plaques, some with associated scale, on his upper back, extensor arms, and lateral thighs (Fig 1, B and C). He had similar violaceous lesions with lichenoid quality on the interphalangeal joints of both hands, cuticular overgrowth, and nailfold telangiectasia (Fig 1, D). No complaints of weakness, malaise, loss of energy, fever, dysphagia, or respiratory symptoms were reported. Proximal and distal muscle strength were normal.

A skin biopsy specimen revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, dermal mucin deposition, and edema (Fig 2, A and B). Antinuclear antibodies were positive at a titer of 1:160. Laboratory data, including levels of creatine kinase, aldolase, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and acute phase reactants, were in the normal ranges. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of muscle inflammation.

Periocular inflammation — preseptal and orbital cellulitis require antibiotics that cover Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species, with consideration for anaerobic coverage; treatment of both preseptal and orbital cellulitis should begin with amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg) orally, 2 times daily for 10 d, with oral fluoroquinolones (such as moxifloxacin) as a substitute if not available; if infection is isolated to the preseptal space, evacuation can be nonemergent, but if there is any question of orbital involvement or lack of response, we recommend emergent evacuation, as orbital cellulitis is a true medical emergency and failure to treat quickly can lead to blindness, intracranial infection, and possibly death. Antibiotics: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for orbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Nonemergent evacuation for periorbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Red face revisited: flushing [^11478a32]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The term red face is reserved for lesions located exclusively or very predominantly on the face that result from changes in cutaneous blood flow triggered by multiple different conditions. Facial erythema may not only present clinically as a distinct entity, but can also be a sign of other diseases. Patients with a red face challenge clinicians to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on date and mode of appearance, characteristics of the erythema, functional signs, and associated systemic manifestations. In most cases, the cause is a benign disease such as rosacea, contact dermatitis, photodermatosis, and climacterium, and a thorough history and physical examination is enough to make a diagnosis; facial erythema may also present as a symptom of drug allergies, cardiac disease, carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma, mastocytosis, and anaphylaxis, as well as some rare causes such as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pancreatic cell tumor, and renal carcinoma where further laboratory, radiologic, or histopathologic studies are required. In this review, the mechanisms of flushing, its clinical differential diagnosis, and management of various conditions that cause flushing are discussed.

### Localized periorbital edema induced by ibuprofen [^114g7Hvt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We documented localized periorbital edema in one patient with ibuprofen sensitivity without underlying chronic urticaria. The reaction developed one hour after ingestion of 200 mg of ibuprofen. No systemic symptoms were observed. No other NSAIDs did not induce symptoms. This patient was able to tolerate doses of ibuprofen after pretreatment with terfenadine. These observations suggest that histamine played a central role in this ibuprofen-induced skin reaction. Treatment with terfenadine enabled the patient to tolerate ibuprofen without experiencing any side effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of periorbital edema induced by ibuprofen.

Initial conventional treatment for presumed preseptal cellulitis was unsuccessful. Despite treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, the preseptal cellulitis progressed to orbital cellulitis with restriction of eye movements in addition to the marked conjunctival chemosis and haemorrhage. A detailed history revealed she had been in close contact with newborn kittens at home and biopsy of the granuloma demonstrated Bartonella species, confirming the diagnosis of cat scratch disease. The child received a course of appropriate oral and topical antibiotics and steroids. Unfortunately eyesight in the right eye remains poor on follow-up.

### Recognizing rosacea: tips on differential diagnosis [^115FEToq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory dermatosis with a variety of clinical manifestations. Rosacea primarily affects the central face, and includes papules, pustules, erythema, telangiectasias, perilesional redness, phymatous changes, and even ocular involvement. Symptoms may vary among different patients and even vary over time in an individual patient. Central facial redness affects many adults and can be an indicator of the chronic inflammatory disease rosacea. Rosacea is a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination, and exclusion of other disorders. It is under-diagnosed, particularly in individuals with skin of color. The goal of this article is to provide clinicians with the tools and understanding needed to correctly identify rosacea and differentiate it from other conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms.

### Bilateral periorbital swelling as the initial presentation of cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^111Z26Ap]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Periorbital edema is a rare and nonspecific presentation for several conditions including SLE, dermatomyositis, solid facial edema, drug reactions (including drug-induced lupus [DIL]), infections, angioedema, systemic contact dermatitis, superior vena cava syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions, sarcoidosis, and others. Laboratory, histopathology, and imaging studies ruled out these diagnoses in our patient.

Our patient did not have any other local or systemic clinical features such as skin lesions (heliotrope rash, Gottron's sign, shawl sign) or musculoskeletal symptoms and signs of myopathy characteristic of dermatomyositis. Additionally, our patient failed to meet the criteria for SLE because of lack of systemic findings including fatigue, arthritis, or involvement of other systems (renal, pulmonary, cardiac, hematologic, neuropsychiatric). A drug-induced process including DIL was less likely, as the patient was taking ibuprofen for several years before the onset of the facial edema without any adverse reactions, and this did not resolve with the discontinuation of ibuprofen. DIL also is reported to be less likely to have a cutaneous presentation. There was also a notable absence of eosinophils on the biopsy findings. Results of serologic studies for dermatomyositis, SLE, and DIL were normal. A maxillofacial computed tomography scan also did not show any findings seen in chronic sinusitis.

### Acute conjunctival inflammation following contact with squashed spider contents [^116fEFQ8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the effects to the eye following contact with spider contents.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

A 46-year-old man presented with a painful and inflamed eye after contents of a spider got into his right eye when he squashed the spider with a newspaper. He suffered immediate severe pain in the eye, which rapidly became red and swollen. He had conjunctival edema and periorbital swelling of the eye and severe photophobia, but his vision was normal.

Results

Topical local anesthetic was applied to the right eye, which was then flushed with normal saline for an hour. The redness and swelling began to resolve over 2 hours.

Conclusions

Ocular exposure to the contents of a spider can cause severe pain, swelling, and redness associated with photophobia. The effects are short term, so reassurance, irrigation, and symptomatic treatment are sufficient.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Treatment of periorbital vascularity, erythema, and hyperpigmentation [^116WJAxL]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common aesthetic concern that impacts patients' emotional well-being and quality of life. POH can be difficult to manage as the etiology is often multifactorial or difficult to elucidate. An understanding of different contributing factors and ability to classify hyperpigmentation can aid in the management of POH. Classification of POH is divided into pigmented, vascular, structural, and mixed subtypes. A wide array of treatment options has been proposed belying the challenges inherent to improving POH. Modalities vary from topical therapies, chemical peels, dermal fillers, and lasers, to surgical intervention. Because POH can be multifactorial, successful management of POH will depend on elucidating the etiology and often requires a combination of therapies.

### The "red face": not always rosacea [^112moHyR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Facial erythema (the "red face") is a straightforward clinical finding, and it is evident even to the untrained eye; however, a red face does not represent a single cutaneous entity. It may be due to a plethora of distinct underlying conditions of varying severity, including rosacea, demodicosis, dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus, allergic contact dermatitis, drug-induced erythema, and emotional blushing. In clinical practice, dermatologists do not encounter only one type of facial erythema but rather a number of different shades of red. This review presents the clinical spectrum of facial erythemas and addresses the question of what lies beneath a red face by discussing the key clinical and histopathologic characteristics.

Executive summary — common sites, hand eczema, facial dermatitis, and cheilitis — The latest NACDG lists the top 3 most common body locations of contact dermatitis as scattered and/or generalized distribution, the hands, and the face, and attention should be given to specific anatomical sites, particularly the eyelids, neck, scalp, axillae, lower extremities, and anogenital area. Facial ACD may present as a generalized facial eruption in specific regions such as the forehead, periorbital, or perioral areas, and sensitizers in commercial facial products that are in direct skin contact are the most common causes of facial ACD. Patients presenting with acute or chronic hand eczema should undergo patch testing, and it is strongly recommended to evaluate all patients with chronic hand eczema for ACD by obtaining a detailed history of contact allergy and performing patch testing. Acute or chronic inflammation of the lips manifested as eczematous cheilitis can be characterized by itching, burning, redness, edema, and fissuring, and Fragrance mix (FM), balsam of Peru (BOP, Myroxylon pereirae), and nickel are the most common positive allergens on PT.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^116asCNT]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Free online mobile phone apps are available to check vision, but most of them have not gained regulatory approval. In a prospective comparative study of app-based home vision testing in children, most families were able to generate results deemed useful for clinical decision making, but parental engagement was low.

Face and eyelid — The presence of vesicles and rashes on the face or eyelids suggest herpes simplex infection or herpes zoster ophthalmicus (if the involvement respects the midline of the face and V1 dermatomal distribution (fig 2)). Presence of Hutchinson's sign (involvement of the tip or lateral aspect of the nose) suggests a higher likelihood of ocular involvement in herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Periorbital swelling may suggest preseptal (less serious) or orbital cellulitis (more serious), with the latter being associated with orbital involvement (for example, painful red eye, reduced visual acuity, proptosis, and restricted eye movement). Preseptal cellulitis can progress to orbital cellulitis, particularly in younger children where the orbital septum has not fully developed. Other aetiology such as angioedema, should be suspected when patient presents with periorbital swelling. Periocular eczema or inflammation is suggestive of allergic eye disease or contact dermatitis (when there is a recent history of using new eyedrops).

### Absolute ethanol embolization of arteriovenous malformations in the periorbital region [^1137A6fM]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) involving the periorbital region are technically challenging clinical entities to manage. The purpose of the present study was to present our initial experience of ethanol embolization in a series of 16 patients with auricular AVMs and assess the outcomes of this treatment.

Methods

Transcatheter arterial embolization and/or direct percutaneous puncture embolization were performed in the 16 patients. Pure or diluted ethanol was manually injected. The follow-up evaluations included physical examination and angiography at 1- to 6-month intervals.

Results

During the 28 ethanol embolization sessions, the amount of ethanol used ranged from 2 to 65 mL. The obliteration of ulceration, hemorrhage, pain, infection, pulsation, and bruit in most of the patients was obtained. The reduction of redness, swelling, and warmth was achieved in all the 16 patients, with down-staging of the Schobinger status for each patient. AVMs were devascularized 100% in 3 patients, 76–99% in 7 patients, and 50–75% in 6 patients, according to the angiographic findings. The most common complications were necrosis and reversible blister. No permanent visual abnormality was found in any of the cases.

Conclusion

Ethanol embolization is efficacious and safe in the treatment of AVMs in the periorbital region and has the potential to be accepted as the primary mode of therapy in the management of these lesions.

### An 11-year-old male with periorbital edema and painful subcutaneous nodules [^117K8ALa]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

As PAN is a medium‐vessel vasculitis, the histopathologic differential diagnosis includes other medium‐vessel vasculitides. These include anti‐neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis, septic vasculitis, and rheumatoid vasculitis. While PAN will typically show neutrophilic karyorrhexis affecting an artery in the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue, the other entities will demonstrate a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate, as they tend to affect a broader range of vessel sizes. Additionally, many of these other entities will have unique characteristics that are lacking in PAN, such as the appearance of palisaded granulomas in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or microorganisms in septic vasculitis.

Treatment guidelines for PAN have not been well‐established given the rarity of disease. However, review of the literature suggests that most pediatric patients are responsive to systemic steroids. Successful treatment with steroid‐sparing agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti‐TNF alpha agents have been reported for childhood cases of PAN. Severe and/or refractory patients have shown improvement with tocilizumab and rituximab therapies. Multiple authors suggest that penicillin should be considered for patients with increased ASO titers, either to treat an active infection or as prophylaxis for future PAN flares.

There are few case reports and small reviews studying the outcomes within the pediatric population. The largest of these studies included 110 pediatric patients with either cutaneous‐only PAN or systemic PAN. Remission rates were similar at 70% and 65%, respectively. The majority of the systemic PAN patients presented with constitutional symptoms (fevers, fatigue, and weight loss) and elevated acute phase reactants; approximately 24% presented with GI symptoms and 22% presented with neurologic symptoms.

Our patient was treated with a three‐day course of pulsed‐dose methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/dose, with rapid improvement in symptoms. He was subsequently discharged on adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks, methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly to prevent the generation of anti‐drug antibodies, and a prolonged steroid taper. He was followed by rheumatology every 4–8 weeks for the first year after his initial hospitalization. Two months after his hospitalization, as his ASO titers remained elevated (304.4 IU/mL), the decision was made to start penicillin G prophylaxis at 1.2 million units every 4 weeks. He received 3 months of injections, but ultimately discontinued due to insurance and social challenges. At this time, the patient remains on adalimumab and methotrexate without recurrence.

### Periorbital changes associated with prostaglandin analogs in Korean patients [^114NjnKt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) are commonly used to treat glaucoma because of their powerful intraocular pressure lowering effect. However, various periorbital changes associated with the use of PGAs have been reported. We investigated the incidence of periorbital changes in Korean patients who were treated with PGAs, and analyzed clinical factors associated with superior sulcus deepening.

Methods

This study included 58 glaucoma patients who were treated with latanoprost, travoprost, or bimatoprost unilaterally. Face photographs were collected, and periorbital changes such as superior sulcus deepening, eyelid pigmentation, ptosis, lid retraction, dermatochalasis, and redness were evaluated by two oculoplastic specialists. For each patient, the contralateral eye served as a control. The frequency of ptosis, dermatochalasis, pigmentation, erythema, and superior sulcus deepening were analyzed. Demographic and ocular factors were compared between patients who showed superior sulcus deepening and those who did not.

Results

Thirty-one patients (53.4%) showed one or more periorbital changes associated with PGAs. The most common change was superior sulcus deepening (24.1%), followed by eyelid pigmentation (19.0%), eyelid erythema (19.0%), dermatochalasis (10.3%), eyelid retraction (5.2%), and ptosis (3.4%). The age of the patient and the duration of PGA administration was significantly correlated with superior sulcus deepening (p = 0.007, p = 0.002, respectively).

Conclusions

Periorbital changes are frequently seen in patients who use PGAs, and superior sulcus deepening is the most common change in Korean patients. Long-term use of PGAs and old age were associated with superior sulcus deepening.

### Periorbital rash and scaly plaques in a 13-year-old boy [^117J154K]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Atopic dermatitis
C. Allergic contact dermatitis
D. Clinically amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis (CAJDM)
E. Systemic sclerosis (SSc)

Answers:
A. Juvenile-onset SLE – Incorrect. Following the 2019 (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria, a diagnosis of SLE cannot be made without systemic involvement and with normal laboratory data. Moreover, in SLE, facial lesions would present as a red, butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks and nose and between the interphalangeal joints.
B. Atopic dermatitis – Incorrect. The absence of muscular involvement leads to a differential diagnosis with papulosquamous dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis. However, the clinical distribution of cutaneous lesions and the absence of spongiotic dermatitis in the skin biopsy specimen are against the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.
C. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Eyelid skin is susceptible to the actions of irritating or allergenic agents; therefore, it can frequently be affected in the context of contact dermatitis. However, violaceous color and cutaneous lesions on both hands cannot be related to an exogenous agent. A cutaneous biopsy would show spongiotic dermatitis.
D. CAJDM – Correct. CAJDM is defined by the presence of hallmark skin lesions of dermatomyositis (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, nailfold capillary changes, and poikiloderma involving the "V" of the chest and the upper back), with no clinical evidence of muscle disease. It represents less than 1% of all juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs). Cases of CAJDM can be classified as amyopathic (no markers of myositis) or hypomyopathic (laboratory, electrophysiologic, or radiologic evidence of myositis). Based on the 2017 (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, the diagnosis could be assessed without a muscle biopsy.
E. SSc – Incorrect. Cutaneous involvement in SSc includes skin thickening, digital ulcers, megacapillaries in the proximal nailfold, calcinosis, and Raynaud phenomenon. However, papulosquamous plaques in the context of this connective tissue disorder are not usually found.

### An eye-opening case of periorbital oedema: a clinicodiagnostic dilemma [^11782iuH]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous metastasis (CM), a rare occurrence, can produce a variety of skin lesions. Signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a very aggressive tumour with low survival rate irrespective of location. We report a case of SRCC with CM presenting with asymptomatic progressive unilateral angio-oedema-like findings. A high index of suspicion and low threshold for biopsy are crucial for early diagnosis of CM as the prognosis is poor, especially when the primary cancer is SRCC.
