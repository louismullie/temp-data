## Question

Tardive dyskinesia treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tardive dyskinesia treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should verify modifiable risk factors and the role of antipsychotic modification. Next, I will review first-line pharmacotherapy, especially VMAT2 inhibitors, and their evidence base. After that, I should consider second-line and adjunctive options, including clonazepam, ginkgo biloba, and botulinum toxin. Finally, I will outline monitoring, special populations, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any outdated assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity, because misclassification is common and early, accurate assessment drives outcomes. I need to ensure we use the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale with activation maneuvers at baseline and at every visit, and I should double-check that movements persist for at least 3 months and are not better explained by other drug-induced movement disorders or spontaneous dyskinesias, since TD is a diagnosis of exclusion and persistence is key [^675d309f] [^e5d9f933] [^59a6b724].

> Wait, let me verify the minimal clinically important difference on AIMS so I can interpret change meaningfully. The best available estimates suggest a 2-point reduction represents minimal improvement and a 3-point reduction represents more robust improvement, which helps me judge whether a treatment effect is clinically meaningful in follow-up visits [^9bd674ea] [^3438df31].

> Next, I should review modifiable risk factors and antipsychotic management, because reducing exposure can mitigate progression and sometimes improve symptoms. I need to check whether we can lower the dose, switch to a lower-risk agent, or taper the offending dopamine receptor blocking agent, while balancing psychiatric stability; I should confirm that abrupt discontinuation risks rebound psychosis and cholinergic withdrawal, so any changes must be gradual and coordinated with psychiatric care [^675d309f] [^8c62c1d6] [^f172d851].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antipsychotic switching. I initially thought switching to second-generation antipsychotics reliably improves TD, but I should double-check the evidence. The AAN guideline concludes evidence is insufficient to support or refute switching as a treatment for established TD, and Cochrane reviews show limited, low-quality data, so switching may help some patients but should not be relied upon as a primary TD treatment strategy [^44b07d7b] [^55b3398d] [^22992e4c].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy. Valbenazine and deutetrabenazine are FDA-approved VMAT2 inhibitors with high-quality evidence; I should confirm that both reduce AIMS scores by about 2–3 points versus placebo over 6–12 weeks and are generally well tolerated, with low rates of depression, suicidality, or parkinsonism in trials, which supports their use as first-line for moderate-to-severe or functionally impairing TD [^df569fed] [^a7f23226] [^09367982].

> Let me consider dosing and titration pragmatics. Deutetrabenazine is typically started at 12 mg/day and titrated by 6 mg weekly to a maximum of 48 mg/day, with a lower maximum of 36 mg/day if strong CYP2D6 inhibitors are used; valbenazine is dosed once daily with 40 mg and 80 mg options, and I should confirm that both agents can be used concurrently with ongoing antipsychotics, which is common in practice and supported by trial designs [^09367982] [^df569fed].

> Next, I should review long-term durability and safety. Open-label extensions show sustained AIMS improvements with deutetrabenazine through 106 weeks and with valbenazine through 48 weeks, with low rates of serious adverse events and no signal for worsening parkinsonism or akathisia; I need to ensure we counsel that symptoms may recur after discontinuation, so maintenance therapy is often necessary if effective [^1bd735f6] [^b5afcbec].

> But wait, what if VMAT2 inhibitors are ineffective or not tolerated? I should consider second-line options with modest evidence. Clonazepam can be considered for short-term symptom relief, though sedation and dependence limit use; ginkgo biloba has Level B support and may help some patients; tetrabenazine is off-label and can reduce movements but carries higher risks of depression, suicidality, and parkinsonism, so I need to screen carefully and monitor closely if I use it [^318b8cb8] [^34da3c3b] [^48f82a8b].

> I need to check adjunctive strategies for focal, disabling movements. Botulinum toxin injections can be useful for targeted orofacial or cervical dystonic components of tardive syndromes, and deep brain stimulation may be considered for severe, refractory cases in specialized centers; I should confirm that these are reserved for intractable presentations after pharmacologic therapy fails [^bb6c6bc1] [^d0161bda].

> Let me reconsider agents with conflicting or negative evidence so I don't overstate their role. Vitamin E showed promise in older, smaller studies but failed to demonstrate benefit in a large, well-conducted randomized trial, so I should not recommend it routinely; similarly, amantadine has limited and inconsistent data, and calcium channel blockers have not shown benefit in randomized trials, so these should not be first- or second-line choices [^2fcc9a92] [^385ef9e3] [^1b3ed2f0].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up. Measurement-based care with AIMS at every visit, documentation of functional impact, and patient-reported distress are essential; I need to ensure we track psychiatric stability, suicidality, parkinsonism, and akathisia at each visit, and adjust VMAT2 dosing based on efficacy and tolerability, recognizing that benefits accrue over weeks to months [^675d309f] [^4678726a].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts. Elderly patients, women, and those with mood disorders or intellectual disability have higher TD risk, and metoclopramide exposure is an independent risk; in these groups, I need to maintain a lower threshold for screening, use the lowest effective antipsychotic dose, and consider earlier VMAT2 therapy if TD emerges, while remembering that metoclopramide-induced TD may improve after stopping the offending agent [^2046112e] [^052fde24] [^675d309f].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, confirm TD with AIMS and exclude mimics; second, optimize antipsychotic management to the lowest effective dose or switch cautiously if clinically feasible; third, initiate a VMAT2 inhibitor for moderate-to-severe or functionally impairing TD; fourth, reassess at 2–4 week intervals and titrate to effect or tolerability; fifth, if inadequate response after 12 weeks, consider switching to the other VMAT2 inhibitor or adding clonazepam or ginkgo biloba; sixth, for focal refractory movements, add botulinum toxin; seventh, for severe, intractable cases, refer for DBS evaluation; throughout, maintain measurement-based care and patient education about chronicity and the need for ongoing therapy [^675d309f] [^254b5289] [^bb6c6bc1].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have addressed the key controversies transparently. Antipsychotic switching may help some patients but evidence is limited; antipsychotics can suppress TD symptoms and thus mask progression, so symptomatic improvement with continued DRBA exposure should be interpreted cautiously; and while VMAT2 inhibitors are effective, they are not curative and often require long-term maintenance, which I need to discuss upfront to align expectations and adherence [^44b07d7b] [^8c62c1d6] [^b5afcbec].

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is best managed with **VMAT2 inhibitors** (valbenazine or deutetrabenazine) as first-line therapy, which reduce abnormal movements by ~30% and are FDA-approved [^df569fed] [^a7f23226] [^09367982]. If VMAT2 inhibitors are unavailable or ineffective, consider **second-line options** such as clonazepam, ginkgo biloba, or tetrabenazine, though evidence is weaker and adverse effects (sedation, depression) are more common [^318b8cb8] [^34da3c3b] [^48f82a8b]. Antipsychotic dose reduction or switching may help, but evidence is limited and must be balanced against psychiatric relapse risk [^55b3398d] [^44b07d7b]. Routine AIMS monitoring and patient education are essential, and persistent TD may require long-term VMAT2 therapy or botulinum toxin for focal movements [^675d309f] [^4678726a] [^bb6c6bc1].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

### VMAT2 inhibitors

- **Valbenazine**: Highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor; phase 3 trials show significant AIMS reduction vs placebo (~3.2 points at 6 weeks) [^df569fed] and sustained benefit in 42-week extensions [^b5afcbec].
- **Deutetrabenazine**: Deuterated tetrabenazine with improved PK; phase 3 trials show ~3.0-point AIMS reduction vs placebo at 12 weeks [^a7f23226] and durable benefit in long-term studies [^1bd735f6].
- **Tetrabenazine**: Off-label VMAT2 inhibitor with evidence of benefit but more adverse effects (depression, sedation, parkinsonism) [^48f82a8b].

---

## Second-line and adjunctive treatments

### Benzodiazepines

Clonazepam has **modest benefit** for mild TD and is recommended by AAN for short-term use due to sedation and dependence risks [^318b8cb8].

---

### Herbal and alternative therapies

Ginkgo biloba has **limited evidence** but may reduce TD symptoms and is considered by AAN when conventional therapies are unsuitable [^34da3c3b].

---

### Other pharmacological agents

- **Amantadine**: Weak evidence; consider if VMAT2 inhibitors are contraindicated [^bf34578d].
- **Botulinum toxin**: For focal, disabling movements (e.g. oromandibular, cervical) [^bb6c6bc1].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Antipsychotic management

Dose reduction or switching may improve TD in some patients, but evidence is limited and must be balanced against psychiatric relapse risk [^55b3398d] [^44b07d7b].

---

### Deep brain stimulation (DBS)

Pallidal DBS is a **last-resort option** for severe, refractory TD with emerging evidence of benefit [^bb6c6bc1] [^d0161bda].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Recommendation level** | **Evidence strength** |
|-|-|-|
| Valbenazine | First-line | Strong |
| Deutetrabenazine | First-line | Strong |
| Tetrabenazine | Second-line | Moderate |
| Clonazepam | Second-line | Moderate |
| Ginkgo biloba | Second-line | Weak |
| Botulinum toxin | Adjunctive | Moderate |
| DBS | Last-resort | Emerging |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular AIMS assessments are essential to track response and guide therapy [^675d309f] [^4678726a]. Patient education should cover TD risks, treatment options, and adherence [^e5d9f933]. Long-term VMAT2 therapy is often required, as symptoms recur after discontinuation [^b5afcbec].

---

## Special considerations

Elderly patients have a higher TD risk and may need lower starting doses and slower titration. Patients with persistent, severe TD despite optimal therapy may benefit from referral to movement disorder specialists for advanced options (e.g. DBS) [^bb6c6bc1].

---

VMAT2 inhibitors are the **cornerstone of TD management**, with clonazepam, ginkgo biloba, and botulinum toxin as adjuncts. Antipsychotic modification may help but requires caution, and persistent cases may need long-term VMAT2 therapy or specialist referral.

### A modified Delphi consensus study of the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of tardive dyskinesia [^986e9139]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

A nominal group process followed by a modified Delphi method was used to survey expert opinions on best practices for tardive dyskinesia (TD) screening, diagnosis, and treatment and to identify areas lacking in clinical evidence.

Participants

A steering committee of 11 TD experts met in nominal group format to prioritize questions to be addressed and identify core bibliographic materials and criteria for survey panelists. Of 60 invited experts, 29 (23 psychiatrists and 6 neurologists) agreed to participate.

Evidence

A targeted literature search of PubMed (search term: tardive dyskinesia) and recommendations of the steering committee were used to generate core bibliographic material. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) review articles, meta-analyses, guidelines, or clinical trials; (2) publication in English between 2007 and 2017; (3) > 3 pages in length; and (4) publication in key clinical journals with impact factors ≥ 2.0. Of 29 references that met these criteria, 18 achieved a score ≥ 5 (calculated as the number of steering committee votes multiplied by journal impact factor and number of citations divided by years since publication) and were included.

Consensus Process

Two survey rounds were conducted anonymously through electronic media from November 2017 to January 2018; responses were collected, collated, and analyzed. Respondent agreement was defined a priori as unanimous (100%), consensus (75%-99%), or majority (50%-74%). For questions using a 5-point Likert scale, agreement was based on percentage of respondents choosing ≥ 4 ("agree completely" or "agree"). Round 1 survey included questions on TD screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Round 2 questions were refined per panelist feedback and excluded Round 1 questions with < 25% agreement and > 75% agreement (unless feedback suggested further investigation).

Conclusions

Consensus was reached that (1) a brief, clinical assessment for TD should be performed at every clinical encounter in patients taking antipsychotics; (2) even mild movements in 1 body area may represent possible TD; (3) management requires an overall evaluation of treatment, including reassessment of antipsychotics and anticholinergics as well as consideration of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors; and (4) informed discussions with patients/caregivers are essential.

### Vitamin E treatment for tardive dyskinesia… [^2fcc9a92]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

The study was a prospective, randomized, 9-site trial of up to 2 years of treatment with d-vitamin E vs matching placebo. One hundred fifty-eight subjects with tardive dyskinesia who were receiving neuroleptic medications were enrolled. The blinded assessments performed were clinical and electromechanical assessments of movement disorders, psychiatric status, and functioning. A review of 11 controlled, therapeutic trials with vitamin E9 found that all but 2 of the trials showed efficacy for vitamin E, either in the full samples or in the subgroup with TD, for no more than 5 years, using the change from baseline in the total score for the Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale 10 as the measure of reduction in abnormal movements.

Enrollment took place during the first year. Subjects received d-vitamin E or matching placebo. Treatment and follow-up were designed for a minimum of 12 months, but, if willing, subjects could keep receiving double-blind treatment until the study ended. To address the possible benefits of vitamin E in its true clinical use, the study protocol allowed treating clinicians to adjust the dose of neuroleptics and switch therapies when clinically indicated. Site personnel recorded all concomitant medications and dose changes at each visit. When compared with the designs of prior trials, the present study used a longer duration of treatment, used a higher dose of vitamin E, most likely. Subjects in prior trials were generally treated with higher doses of typical neuroleptics compared with those in the present study.

In addition, about 26% of the subjects in the present study had anticholinergic medications discontinued during the course of treatment, while in prior trials anticholinergic treatment was continued throughout. Anticholinergics were discontinued evenly in the vitamin E and placebo groups.

### Antipsychotic reduction and / or cessation and antipsychotics as specific treatments for tardive dyskinesia [^55b3398d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Since the 1950s antipsychotic medication has been extensively used to treat people with chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. These drugs, however, have also been associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements around the mouth and face. Various strategies have been examined to reduce a person's cumulative exposure to antipsychotics. These strategies include dose reduction, intermittent dosing strategies such as drug holidays, and antipsychotic cessation.

Objectives

To determine whether a reduction or cessation of antipsychotic drugs is associated with a reduction in TD for people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) who have existing TD. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the use of specific antipsychotics for similar groups of people could be a treatment for TD that was already established.

Search Methods

We updated previous searches of Cochrane Schizophrenia's study-based Register of Trials including the registers of clinical trials (16 July 2015 and 26 April 2017). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We also contacted authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included reports if they assessed people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had established antipsychotic-induced TD, and had been randomly allocated to (a) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic cessation (placebo or no intervention), (b) antipsychotic maintenance versus antipsychotic reduction (including intermittent strategies), (c) specific antipsychotics for the treatment of TD versus placebo or no intervention, and (d) specific antipsychotics versus other antipsychotics or versus any other drugs for the treatment of TD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data from these trials and estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who dropped out had no improvement.

Main Results

We included 13 RCTs with 711 participants; eight of these studies were newly included in this 2017 update. One trial is ongoing. There was low-quality evidence of a clear difference on no clinically important improvement in TD favouring switch to risperidone compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (1 RCT, 42 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.23 to 0.89, low-quality evidence). Because evidence was of very low quality for antipsychotic dose reduction versus antipsychotic maintenance (2 RCTs, 17 people, RR 0.42 95% CI 0.17 to 1.04, very low-quality evidence), and for switch to a new antipsychotic versus switch to another new antipsychotic (5 comparisons, 5 RCTs, 140 people, no meta-analysis, effects for all comparisons equivocal), we are uncertain about these effects. There was low-quality evidence of a significant difference on extrapyramidal symptoms: use of antiparkinsonism medication favouring switch to quetiapine compared with switch to haloperidol (1 RCT, 45 people, RR 0.45 CI 0.21 to 0.96, low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for switch to risperidone or haloperidol compared with antipsychotic cessation (with placebo) (RR 1 RCT, 48 people, RR 2.08 95% CI 0.74 to 5.86, low-quality evidence) and switch to risperidone compared with switch to haloperidol (RR 1 RCT, 37 people, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35, very low-quality evidence). Trials also reported on secondary outcomes such as other TD symptom outcomes, other adverse events outcomes, mental state, and leaving the study early, but the quality of the evidence for all these outcomes was very low due mainly to small sample sizes, very wide 95% CIs, and risk of bias. No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, outcomes that we designated as being important to patients.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited data from small studies using antipsychotic reduction or specific antipsychotic drugs as treatments for TD did not provide any convincing evidence of the value of these approaches. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration to fully investigate this area.

### Neuroleptic reduction and / or cessation and neuroleptics as specific treatments for tardive dyskinesia [^22992e4c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Since the 1950s neuroleptic medication has been extensively used to treat people with chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. These drugs, however, have been also associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD). Various strategies have been examined to reduce a person's cumulative exposure to neuroleptics. These studies include dose reduction, intermittent dosing strategies such as drug holidays, and neuroleptic cessation.

Objectives

To determine whether a reduction or cessation of neuroleptic drugs is associated with a reduction in TD, for people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) who have existing TD. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the use of specific neuroleptics for similar groups of people could be a treatment for TD that was already established.

Search Strategy

We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (1997), Biological Abstracts (1982–1997), EMBASE (1980–1997), LILACS (1982–1996), MEDLINE (1966–1997), PsycLIT (1974–1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (July 2003). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations. We also contacted the principal authors of trials for further unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included reports if they assessed people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had established neuroleptic-induced TD, and had been randomly allocated to (a) neuroleptic maintenance versus neuroleptic cessation (placebo or no intervention), (b) neuroleptic maintenance versus neuroleptic reduction (including intermittent strategies), and (c) specific neuroleptics for the treatment of TD versus, placebo or intervention. A post hoc decision was made to broaden comparison (c) to include specific neuroleptics versus other neuroleptics for the treatment of TD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We (KSW, JR) independently inspected citations and, where possible, abstracts, ordered papers, and re-inspected and quality assessed these and extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using random effects relative risk (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm statistic (NNH). We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of people were lost to follow up, but, where possible, we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD). It was assumed that those leaving the study early showed no improvement.

Main Results

We included five trials and excluded 102. One small two week study (n = 18), reported on the 'masking' effects of molindone and haloperidol on TD, which favoured haloperidol (RR 3.44 CI 1.1 to 5.8). Two (total n = 17) studies found no reduction in TD associated with neuroleptic reduction (RR 0.38 CI 0.1 to 1.0). One study (n = 20) found no significant differences in oral dyskinesia (RR 2.45 CI 0.3 to 19.7) when neuroleptics were compared as a specific treatment for TD. Dyskinesia was found to be not significantly different (n = 32, RR 0.62 CI 0.3 to 1.26) between quetiapine and haloperidol when these neuroleptics were used as specific treatments for TD, although the need for additional neuroleptics was significantly lower in the quetiapine group (n = 47, RR 0.49 CI 0.2 to 1.0) than in those given haloperidol.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited data from small studies using neuroleptic reduction or specific neuroleptic drugs as treatments for TD did not provide any convincing evidence of the value of these approaches. There is a need for larger trials of a longer duration in order to fully investigate this area.

### Measurement-based diagnosis and treatment for tardive dyskinesia [^675d309f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with agents that block dopamine receptors, particularly antipsychotics. TD commonly involves the orofacial muscles and extremities, and, because these movements are out of the patient's control, they can have serious physical and psychological effects. An accurate and early diagnosis of TD is crucial because the risk of permanence increases over time. To minimize the risk of TD development, clinicians should use the lowest necessary doses of dopamine receptor blocking agents, and, if allowed by the treated condition, the dopamine receptor blocking agents should be stopped after the shortest necessary time. Clinicians should try to avoid parkinsonian adverse effects and akathisia and prefer second-generation antipsychotics over first-generation antipsychotics. Moreover, clinicians should differentiate between TD and other drug-induced movement disorders, particularly drug-induced parkinsonism, as anticholinergic treatment can worsen TD. To facilitate measurement-based care, clinicians should use the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale examination to screen for and routinely monitor TD, especially when providing treatments intended to decrease the symptoms and impact of TD. Two vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat TD. For patients who have moderate to severe or disabling TD, the American Psychiatric Association recommends treatment with the VMAT2 inhibitors. Clinicians should communicate with patients and care partners about risk factors for and signs of TD, as well as available treatment options for TD and what they can expect in terms of short- and long-term results.

### Tardive dyskinesia: recognition, patient assessment, and differential diagnosis [^59a6b724]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with antipsychotic treatment. Because of the serious and potentially irreversible nature of TD, accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, diagnosing TD can be challenging, since the subtle and often fluctuating symptoms can be easily mistaken for symptoms of mental illness or other side effects. Although the risk of developing TD in relation to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics is lower than that associated with first-generation antipsychotics, the risk still exists and may be greater than once believed. Clinicians prescribe antipsychotics for a variety of illnesses and may underestimate the possibility of a patient developing TD, thus missing early signs of the disorder. In this ACADEMIC HIGHLIGHTS, experts review the prevalence, phenomenology, risk factors, and impact of TD, illustrated by case examples, and provide valuable clinical information to guide early recognition and accurate diagnosis.

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^8c62c1d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and therapy may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Identifying tardive dyskinesia: risk factors, functional impact, and diagnostic tools [^58810827]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder induced by dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs), including antipsychotics. Because the introduction of second-generation antipsychotics has reduced but not eliminated the risk for TD as had been hoped, recognizing and treating TD are important skills for clinicians. Many patients rely on DRBAs for chronic conditions. To minimize the risk of patients' involuntary movements becoming permanent, they must be detected early and treated. To improve the early recognition and diagnosis of TD, clinicians must know the risk factors, understand the functional impairment, regularly and systematically assess their patients, and appropriately apply diagnostic criteria.

---

### Earlier diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia [^5c7f1001]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) have an insidious onset and fluctuating nature, and the risk of TD associated with second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) treatment has been underestimated, it has been challenging for clinicians to make an early and accurate TD diagnosis. More patients are at risk of developing this potentially permanent, disabling condition than ever before because of the widespread use of SGAs; therefore, prevention of TD, if possible, is of utmost importance. Clinicians must use reliable screening tools and diagnostic criteria to assess patients for TD, rule out other abnormal movement conditions, and make an accurate TD diagnosis.

### Revisiting the abnormal involuntary movement scale: proceedings from the tardive dyskinesia assessment workshop [^1f2c3d88]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an historic overview of the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in clinical trials of tardive dyskinesia (TD), with current recommendations for analyzing and interpreting AIMS data.

Participants

Seven psychiatrists and 1 neurologist were selected by the workshop sponsor based on each individual's clinical expertise and research experience.

Evidence

Using PubMed entries from January 1970 to August 2017, participants selected studies that used the AIMS to evaluate TD treatments. The selections were intended to be representative rather than prescriptive or exhaustive, and no specific recommendations for TD treatment are implied.

Consensus Process

The Working Group met in October 2016 to discuss the AIMS as an assessment tool, outline the challenges of translating clinical trial results into everyday clinical practice, and propose different methods for reporting AIMS data in clinically relevant terms. Recommendations for selecting TD studies for review, analyzing and interpreting AIMS data, and synthesizing discussions among the participants were initiated during the onsite workshop and continued remotely throughout development of this report. Disagreements were resolved via group e-mails and teleconferences. Consensus was based on final approval of this report by all workshop participants.

Conclusions

For both research and clinical practice, the AIMS is a valid measure for assessing TD and the effects of treatment, but alternative analyses of AIMS data (eg, effect size, minimal clinically important difference, response analyses, category shifts) may provide broader evidence of clinical effectiveness. No single analysis of AIMS data can be considered the standard of clinical efficacy; multiple analytic approaches are recommended.

### Historical perspectives on tardive dyskinesia [^a748834d]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a persistent hyperkinetic movement disorder associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents including antipsychotic medications. Although uncertainty and concern about this drug side effect have vacillated since its initial recognition 60 years ago, recent commercial interest in developing effective treatments has rekindled scientific and clinical interest after a protracted period of neglect. Although substantial research has advanced knowledge of the clinical features and epidemiology of TD, many fundamental questions raised by early investigators remain unresolved. In this paper, we review the early clinical reports that led to the acceptance of TD as an iatrogenic disorder and the lingering controversies that emerged thereafter. Continued research on TD as a serious adverse reaction to treatment may not only enhance patient outcomes and recovery efforts but may also provide insights into both the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs and the nosology and pathophysiology of idiopathic psychomotor disorders.

### Prochlorperazine [^cba0b79c]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.

The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Clozapine and tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia: a systematic review [^1a27d55a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is commonly recommended that a switch to clozapine be implemented in the face of tardive dyskinesia, even if current treatment involves another "atypical" agent. However, reports do indicate clozapine carries a liability for tardive dyskinesia.

Aims

This review sought to evaluate clozapine in relation to tardive dyskinesia in the context of available evidence.

Methods

Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published in English, using the keywords: clozapine AND tardive dyskinesia OR TD. References from major review articles were searched for additional relevant publications. Studies were included if they investigated: tardive dyskinesia in clozapine-treated patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and reported on two or more assessments of tardive dyskinesia severity measured by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale; or clozapine's tardive dyskinesia liability.

Results

In total, 513 unique citations were identified and 29 reports met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies suggest clozapine reduces dyskinetic symptoms over time (n = 905 clozapine-treated participants); however, the minimum required dose and effect of withdrawal requires further investigation. The majority of reports which address clozapine's liability for tardive dyskinesia are case studies (11 of 14 reports, 79%), and clozapine was only the first-line treatment in one of the remaining three studies reporting treatment-emergent dyskinetic symptoms with clozapine in 12% of patients. No significant between-drug differences were identified comparing clozapine's risk to other atypical antipsychotics.

Conclusions

Research to date supports switching to clozapine for the purpose of reducing tardive dyskinesia risk and/or treating existing tardive dyskinesia, but prospective randomized controlled trials are necessary if we are to substantiate existing recommendations.

### Asenapine [^d970738d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including asenapine. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

There is no known treatment for tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, asenapine should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1)who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and (2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on asenapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with asenapine despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Treatment strategies for tardive dyskinesia [^c5a5f376]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a condition of potentially irreversible abnormal involuntary movements that is associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs), produces significant impairment of functioning and quality of life for patients. Contrary to expectations, TD has not vanished despite the introduction of SGAs. Instead, changing prescription practices and increased off-label prescription of DRBAs have placed more patients than ever at risk of this potentially dangerous and disabling condition. This activity provides an overview of treatment strategies for TD as part of an individualized management plan, including DRBA medication adjustment and antidyskinetic treatment.

### FDA-approved medications to treat tardive dyskinesia [^ac1274b8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a condition characterized by involuntary movements, is found in patients taking antipsychotics or other agents that block dopamine receptors. Symptoms of TD are associated with reduced quality of life, psychosocial problems, and medication nonadherence. Few agents tested in the treatment of TD had sufficient data to support or refute their use, until recently. A review of new evidence was combined with the existing guideline to provide new treatment recommendations. This activity provides an overview of treatments for patients with TD, including valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, which both received FDA approval for the treatment of TD.

### Revisiting tardive dyskinesia: focusing on the basics of identification and treatment [^d2110319]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of second-generation antipsychotics has not eliminated tardive dyskinesia (TD), and the prevalence of the disorder is higher than commonly realized. The involuntary movements of TD can decrease patients' quality of life, cause embarrassment, and lead to social withdrawal. Clinicians must evaluate patients taking DRBAs for TD risk factors and regularly screen them for TD using a rating scale. Familiarity with tools and diagnostic criteria will enable clinicians to conduct a differential diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is made, medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration can be used to treat the condition. These medications are effective, but clinicians should be aware of key differences. A baseline assessment and regular follow-up evaluations will allow the clinician to monitor the patient's progress and make adjustments to meet treatment goals.​.

### Deutetrabenazine for treatment of involuntary movements in patients with tardive dyskinesia (AIM-TD): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^a7f23226]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Tardive dyskinesia results from exposure to dopamine receptor antagonists, such as typical and atypical antipsychotics. If clinically appropriate, clinicians often manage this disorder by lowering the dose of, or discontinuing, the causative drug. There is a significant unmet need for a treatment option that does not disrupt treatment regimens for underlying psychiatric illnesses. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fixed doses of deutetrabenazine-a novel vesicular monoamine transporter-2 inhibitor-in patients with tardive dyskinesia.

Methods

We did this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 75 centres in the USA and Europe. Patients aged 18–80 years with tardive dyskinesia (≥ 3 months before screening) were randomly assigned centrally (1:1:1:1), via interactive response technology, to receive one of three fixed doses of deutetrabenazine (12 mg/day, 24 mg/day, or 36 mg/day) or matching placebo. Randomisation was stratified by baseline use of dopamine receptor antagonists. Patients were started on oral deutetrabenazine 12 mg/day, and this dose was increased through week 4 until the randomised dose was achieved, then maintained over 8 weeks. During the treatment period, patients, investigators, their site personnel, and sponsor were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score from baseline to week 12 in patients with at least one post-baseline rating. The primary efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population (baseline AIMS score ≥ 6 and at least one post-baseline rating). The safety analysis was done in patients who received any study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02291861.

Findings

Between Oct 29, 2014, and Aug 19, 2016, we randomly assigned 298 patients to receive at least one dose of placebo (n = 74), deutetrabenazine 12 mg/day (n = 75), 24 mg/day (n = 74), or 36 mg/day (n = 75); 222 patients comprised the modified intention-to-treat population and 293 patients comprised the safety population. From baseline to week 12, the least-squares mean AIMS score improved by -3.3 points (SE 0.42) in the deutetrabenazine 36 mg/day group, -3.2 points (0.45) in the 24 mg/day group, and -2.1 points (0.42) in the 12 mg/day group, with a treatment difference of -1.9 points (SE 0.58, 95% CI -3.09 to -0.79; p = 0.001), -1.8 points (0.60, -3.00 to -0.63; p = 0.003), and -0.7 points (0.57, -1.84 to 0.42; p = 0.217), respectively, versus -1.4 points (0.41) in the placebo group. The rate of adverse events was similar between patients in the deutetrabenazine 36 mg/day group (n = 38/74 [51%]), 24 mg/day group (n = 32/73 [44%]), and 12 mg/day group (n = 36/74 [49%]), and those in the placebo group (n = 34/72 [47%]). Serious adverse events were reported in four (5%) patients given deutetrabenazine 36 mg/day, six (8%) patients given 24 mg/day, and two (3%) patients given 12 mg/day, compared with four (6%) patients given placebo. Two (1%) patients in the safety population died, one each in the deutetrabenazine 24 mg/day and 36 mg/day groups; neither death was deemed related to study drug by the investigator or sponsor.

Interpretation

Deutetrabenazine 24 mg/day and 36 mg/day provided a significant reduction in tardive dyskinesia, with favourable safety and tolerability. These findings suggest that dosing regimens could be individualised and tailored for patients on the basis of dyskinesia control and tolerability.

### Epidemiology, prevention, and assessment of tardive dyskinesia and advances in treatment [^3f0c8eaa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

​​ Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disorder characterized by involuntary movements, typically of the orofacial muscles and also of the extremities and other muscle groups. The condition is associated with exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents, including antipsychotics. Because the indications and off-label uses for these agents have expanded over the last 2 decades, a larger number of patients are receiving antipsychotic medications than in the past. While evidence suggests that patients being treated with second-generation antipsychotics have less risk for developing TD than those treated with first-generation antipsychotics, the decreased risk is not as great as was originally expected. In addition, patients with chronic psychiatric conditions often require long-term use of antipsychotics, putting them at risk for TD. This article addresses the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention of TD; assessment strategies including diagnostic criteria and rating scales; and evidence for TD treatments, including 2 newly approved medications: deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. ​​​.

### How to evaluate patients for tardive dyskinesia [^b28d7a14]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

​​​​​​​​ Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious and potentially irreversible movement disorder that occurs in 20%-50% of patients taking antipsychotic drugs. TD is also associated with several other classes of medications, including antidepressants, antihistamines, decongestants, mood stabilizers, and stimulants. As more people are prescribed medications that can increase the risk for TD, it is important that clinicians learn how to systematically and reasonably evaluate their patients for this potentially dangerous and debilitating condition.

### Non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia [^385ef9e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disabling movement disorder associated with the prolonged use of antipsychotic medication. Several strategies have been examined in the treatment of TD. Currently, however, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of these drugs in TD and they have been associated with many side effects. One particular strategy would be to use pharmaceutical agents which are known to influence the catecholaminergic system at various junctures.

Objectives

1. To determine the effects of any of the following drugs for antipsychotic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses.i. Drugs which influence the noradrenergic system.ii. Dopamine receptor agonists.iii. Dopamine receptor antagonists.iv. Dopamine-depletor drugs.v. Drugs that increase the production or release of dopamine.2. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than 6 weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow-up.3. To examine if there was a differential effect for the various compounds.4. To examine whether the use of non-antipsychotic catecholaminergic drugs are most effective in those with more recent onset TD (less than five years).

Search Methods

We retrieved 712 references from searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017). We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We selected studies if they were randomised controlled trials focusing on people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses and antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. We compared the use of catecholaminergic interventions versus placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assumed that people who left the studies early had no improvement.

Main Results

There are 10 included trials (N = 261) published between 1973 and 2010; eight are new from the 2015 and 2017 update searches. Forty-eight studies are excluded. Participants were mostly chronically mentally ill inpatients in their 50s, and studies were primarily of short (2 to 6 weeks) duration. The overall risk of bias in these studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and generation of the sequence. Studies were also not clearly blinded and we are unsure if data are incomplete or selectively reported, or if other biases were operating. One small, three-arm trial found that both alpha-methyldopa (N = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80; low-quality evidence) and reserpine (N = 20; RR 0.52 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96; low-quality evidence) may lead to a clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared with placebo after 2 weeks' treatment, but found no evidence of a difference between alpha-methyldopa and reserpine (N = 20; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.86; very low quality evidence). Another small trial compared tetrabenazine and haloperidol after 18 weeks' treatment and found no evidence of a difference on clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms (N = 13; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.95; very low quality evidence). No study reported on adverse events. For remaining outcomes there was no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions: alpha-methyldopa versus placebo for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 20; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32; very low quality evidence), celiprolol versus placebo for leaving the study early (1 RCT; N = 35; RR 5.28, 95% CI 0.27 to 102.58; very low quality evidence) and quality of life (1 RCT; N = 35; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.12; very low quality evidence), alpha-methyldopa versus reserpine for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 20; not estimable, no reported events; very low quality evidence), reserpine or carbidopa/levodopa versus placebo for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (2 RCTs; N = 37; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.99; very low quality evidence), oxypertine versus placebo for deterioration of mental state (1 RCT; N = 42; RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.22 to 22.45; very low quality evidence), dopaminergic drugs (amantadine, bromocriptine, tiapride, oxypertine, carbidopa/levodopa) versus placebo for leaving the study early (6 RCTs; N = 163; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.54; very low quality evidence), and tetrabenazine versus haloperidol for deterioration of tardive dyskinesia symptoms (1 RCT; N = 13; RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 14.92) and leaving the study early (1 RCT; N = 13; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00).

Authors' Conclusions

Although there has been a large amount of research in this area, many studies were excluded due to inherent problems in the nature of their cross-over designs. Usually data are not reported before the cross-over and the nature of TD and its likely response to treatments make it imprudent to use this data. The review provides little usable information for service users or providers and more well-designed and well-reported studies are indicated.

### Future directions in tardive dyskinesia research [^dc973453]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) research is at a crossroads because of renewed interest in this syndrome following the successful development and regulatory approval of two novel vesicular monoamine transport 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors. Despite these clinical advances, significant lacunae exist in the knowledge base of TD pathophysiology, prognosis, and epidemiology. Moreover, conflicting definitions of TD as either a syndrome that encompasses a broad array of related phenomena or as a specific subset of tardive syndromes are an impediment to both clinical and basic science research, and to educational efforts targeting nonspecialist clinicians. A unique opportunity is thus presented by the enhanced focus on TD to resolve fundamental issues with regards to nomenclature and clinical criteria, thereby facilitating more sophisticated surveillance and genetic and epidemiological research into tardive movement disorders related to dopamine receptor blocking agents. The widespread use of newer antipsychotics portends that TD will remain a persistent public health issue. This article will present one view of research avenues to be explored for this neuropsychiatric condition, including those that may yield immediate therapeutic benefits by extending expert knowledge into routine clinical care situations.

### Treatment of tardive dyskinesia… [^62c9305b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Based on the hypothesis that an enhanced dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia may play a major role in tardive dyskinesia, the clinical efficacy of two dopamine-blocking agents, haloperidol and thiopropazate dihydrochloride, for the short-term treatment of tardive dyskinesia was studied on 20 patients for four weeks. Both drugs were shown to have marked antidyskinetic effects in over a half of the patients. Improvements of dyskinesia were not always accompanied by development of reversible extrapyramidal symptoms. These results, together with the findings obtained in the previous study, appear to support the above-mentioned hypothesis, and suggest another approach to the symptomatic control of tardive dyskinesia through neurochemical regulation, although the clinical practicability of these drug regimens over a longer period of time is not established and needs further investigation.

### Prochlorperazine maleate [^868a52af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic drug treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic drug treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.

The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia especially in the elderly. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Updating the recommendations for treatment of tardive syndromes: a systematic review of new evidence and practical treatment algorithm [^bb6c6bc1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Management of tardive syndromes (TS) is challenging, with only a few evidence-based therapeutic algorithms reported in the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guideline in 2013.

Objective

To update the evidence-based recommendations and provide a practical treatment algorithm for management of TS by addressing 5 questions: 1) Is withdrawal of dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) an effective TS treatment? 2) Does switching from typical to atypical DRBAs reduce TS symptoms? 3) What is the efficacy of pharmacologic agents in treating TS? 4) Do patients with TS benefit from chemodenervation with botulinum toxin? 5) Do patients with TS benefit from surgical therapy?

Methods

Systematic reviews were conducted by searching PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane for articles published between 2012 and 2017 to identify new evidence published after the 2013 AAN guidelines. Articles were classified according to an AAN 4-tiered evidence-rating scheme. To the extent possible, for each study we attempted to categorize results based on the description of the population enrolled (tardive dyskinesia [TD], tardive dystonia, tardive tremor, etc.). Recommendations were based on the evidence.

Results and Recommendations

New evidence was combined with the existing guideline evidence to inform our recommendations. Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine are established as effective treatments of TD (Level A) and must be recommended as treatment. Clonazepam and Ginkgo biloba probably improve TD (Level B) and should be considered as treatment. Amantadine and tetrabenazine might be considered as TD treatment (Level C). Pallidal deep brain stimulation possibly improves TD and might be considered as a treatment for intractable TD (Level C). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute TS treatment by withdrawing causative agents or switching from typical to atypical DRBA (Level U).

### Iloperidone [^2dcb6c57]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is impossible to predict, which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, Iloperidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Iloperidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with Iloperidone despite the presence of the syndrome.

### NBI-98854, a selective monoamine transport inhibitor for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^12ab3382]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Tardive dyskinesia is a persistent movement disorder induced by chronic neuroleptic exposure. NBI‐98854 is a novel, highly selective, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor. We present results of a randomized, 6‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐titration study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NBI‐98854 for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia.

Methods

Male and female adult subjects with moderate or severe tardive dyskinesia were included. NBI‐98854 or placebo was given once per day starting at 25 mg and then escalated by 25 mg to a maximum of 75 mg based on dyskinesia and tolerability assessment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale from baseline at week 6 scored by blinded, central video raters. The secondary endpoint was the Clinical Global Impression of Change — Tardive Dyskinesia score assessed by the blinded investigator.

Results

Two hundred five potential subjects were screened, and 102 were randomized; 76% of NBI‐98854 subjects and 80% of placebo subjects reached the maximum allowed dose. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores for NBI‐98854 compared with placebo were significantly reduced (p = 0.0005). Active drug was also superior on the Clinical Global Impression of Change — Tardive Dyskinesia (p < 0.0001). Treatment‐emergent adverse event rates were 49% in the NBI‐98854 and 33% in the placebo subjects. The most common adverse events (active vs. placebo) were fatigue and headache (9.8% vs. 4.1%) and constipation and urinary tract infection (3.9% vs. 6.1%). No clinically relevant changes in safety assessments were noted.

Conclusion

NBI‐98854 significantly improved tardive dyskinesia and was well tolerated in patients. These results support the phase 3 clinical trials of NBI‐98854 now underway. © 2015 The Authors.

### Therapeutic strategies against tardive dyskinesia… [^5ed687b3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- We reviewed 285 treatment studies involving more than 3, 000 patients with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic withdrawal is found to reverse dyskinesia in about 37% of patients. There is no satisfactory treatment for persistent TD. Although neuroleptics are significantly superior to most other methods of treatment in suppressing signs of dyskinesia, the safety of their long-term use in dyskinetic patients remains to be demonstrated. Putative β-aminobutyric acid — ergic drugs and noradrenergic blockers deserve careful study. A strategy for determining biochemical and pharmacologic subtypes of TD appears promising. The value of the available cholinergic agents in the treatment of TD is uncertain. Caution is warranted in interpreting "positive" results with a number of other drugs, which might act as placebos or as nonspecific sedatives. Anticholinergic drugs are generally not recommended for treating dyskinetic patients.

Current theories of the pathophysiology of TD may need revision. Drug-free periods do not seem to prevent TD. Antipsychotic drugs without neuroleptic side effects should be developed.

### Randomized controlled trial of deutetrabenazine for tardive dyskinesia: the ARM-TD study [^a30003e7]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective:

To determine the efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia (TD).

Methods:

One hundred seventeen patients with moderate to severe TD received deutetrabenazine or placebo in this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial. Eligibility criteria included an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score of ≥ 6 assessed by blinded central video rating, stable psychiatric illness, and stable psychoactive medication treatment. Primary endpoint was the change in AIMS score from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included treatment success at week 12 on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) and Patient Global Impression of Change.

Results:

For the primary endpoint, deutetrabenazine significantly reduced AIMS scores from baseline to week 12 vs placebo (least-squares mean [standard error] −3.0 [0.45] vs −1.6 [0.46], p = 0.019). Treatment success on CGIC (48.2% vs 40.4%) favored deutetrabenazine but was not significant. Deutetrabenazine and placebo groups showed low rates of psychiatric adverse events: anxiety (3.4% vs 6.8%), depressed mood/depression (1.7% vs 1.7%), and suicidal ideation (0% vs 1.7%, respectively). In addition, no worsening in parkinsonism, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscale, was noted from baseline to week 12 in either group.

Conclusions:

In patients with TD, deutetrabenazine was well tolerated and significantly reduced abnormal movements.

Classification of evidence:

This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with TD, deutetrabenazine reduces AIMS scores.

Tardive Dyskinesia:

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of neuroleptic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether neuroleptic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of neuroleptic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.

The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Clinical risk factors for the development of tardive dyskinesia [^2046112e]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a severe condition that can affect almost 1 out of 4 patients on current or previous antipsychotic treatment, including both first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). While two novel vesicular monoamine transporter inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, have shown acute efficacy for TD, the majority of patients do not remit, and TD appears to recur once treatment is withdrawn. Hence, prevention of TD remains a crucial goal.

Methods

We provide a clinically oriented overview of risk factors for TD, dividing them into patient-, illness- and treatment-related variables, as well as nonmodifiable and modifiable factors.

Results

Unmodifiable patient-related and illness-related risk factors for TD include older age, female sex, white and African descent, longer illness duration, intellectual disability and brain damage, negative symptoms in schizophrenia, mood disorders, cognitive symptoms in mood disorders, and gene polymorphisms involving antipsychotic metabolism and dopamine functioning. Modifiable comorbidity-related and treatment-related factors include diabetes, smoking, and alcohol and substance abuse, FGA vs SGA treatment, higher cumulative and current antipsychotic dose or antipsychotic plasma levels, early parkinsonian side effects, anticholinergic co-treatment, akathisia, and emergent dyskinesia.

Discussion

Clinicians using dopamine antagonists need to consider risk factors for TD to minimize TD and its consequences.

### Calcium channel blockers for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia [^7be460b3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia and related disorders affect a sizable proportion of any population. Neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications are the primary treatment for these disorders. Neuroleptic medications are associated with a variety of side effects including tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia is difficult to treat, despite experimentation with several treatments. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) have been among these experimental treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effects of calcium-channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses.

Search Strategy

We updated previous searches in May 2010 by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing calcium-channel blockers with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention for people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or serious mental illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to extract and analyse data on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. We intended to calculate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data using a random-effects model, and, where possible, calculate the number needed to treat. We planned to calculate mean differences (MD) for continuous data.

Main Results

We did not include any trials in this review. We excluded 15 studies; eight were not randomised, one did not use calcium channel blockers, five small, randomised, studies reported no usable data and one did not include people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of calcium-channel blockers for antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia are unknown. Their use is experimental and should only be given in the context of well designed randomised clinical trials.

### Diagnostic and treatment fundamentals for tardive dyskinesia [^e5d9f933]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) consists of involuntary movements of the tongue, lips, face, trunk, and extremities that occur in patients treated long-term with dopamine antagonist medications. TD can be associated with significant functional impairment and be socially stigmatizing. TD, once established, has proved to be often irreversible and remains a significant treatment issue. An accurate and early diagnosis of TD is crucial because the risk of permanence increases over time. Clinicians should be educated on which patients are most at risk for TD and conduct assessments through clinical examination or through the use of a structured evaluative tool such as the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Patients and caregivers need to be educated about the risks of and alternatives to antipsychotic medication and early signs of TD. New treatment approaches to persistent TD are available and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. When treatment is initiated, a baseline assessment should be obtained by clinicians using the AIMS and follow-up assessments should be done on a regular basis. In this educational activity, Drs Correll and Citrome offer a review of the diagnostic and treatment fundamentals for TD.

### Calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia [^1b3ed2f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia and related disorders affect a sizable proportion of any population. Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for these disorders. Antipsychotic medications are associated with a variety of adverse effects including tardive dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is a disfiguring movement disorder of the orofacial region that can be tardive (having a slow or belated onset). Tardive dyskinesia is difficult to treat, despite experimentation with several treatments. Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, flunarizine) have been among these experimental treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effects of calcium channel blocker drugs (diltiazem, nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil) for treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials comparing calcium channel blockers with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention for people with both tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia or serious mental illness who remained on their antipsychotic medication.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data and estimated risk ratios of dichotomous data or mean differences (MD) of continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assumed that people who left the trials early had no improvement. We also created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

Previous versions of this review included no trials. From the 2015 search, we identified three cross-over trials that could be included. The 2017 search found no new studies relevant to this review. The included trials randomised 47 inpatients with chronic mental illnesses in the USA and China. Trials were published in the 1990s and were of short duration (six to 10 weeks). Overall, the risk of bias was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, studies were not clearly blinded, and attrition and outcome data were not fully reported. Findings were sparse, no study reported on the primary outcome 'no clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms', but two small studies (37 participants) found no difference on the tardive dyskinesia symptoms scale Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores between diltiazem or flunarizine and placebo after three to four weeks' treatment (MD -0.71, 95% CI -2.68 to 1.26, very low quality evidence). Only one study randomising 20 participants reported on adverse events, and reported that there were no adverse events with flunarizine or with placebo (very low quality evidence). One study with 18 participants reported no events of deterioration in mental state with diltiazem or with placebo (very low quality evidence). No studies reported on acceptability of treatment or on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or personalised quality of life outcomes designated important to patients.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from randomised controlled trials is extremely limited and very low quality, conclusions cannot be drawn. The effects of calcium channel blockers for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia are unknown. Their use is experimental and should only be given in the context of well-designed randomised trials.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (metoclopramide) [^052fde24]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: TARDIVE DYSKINESIA

Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose.

Metoclopramide therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is no known treatment for tardive dyskinesia. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide treatment is stopped.

Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia.

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^d343f8e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Tardive Dyskinesia

A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, quetiapine extended-release tablets should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought.

### Reprint of: clinical management of tardive dyskinesia: five steps to success [^cde46924]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has long been thought to be a generally irreversible consequence of the use of dopamine receptor blocking agents. There is now an opportunity to successfully manage this condition with agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is important because TD has not been eliminated with the use of second-generation antipsychotics, and the expansion of antipsychotics to treat conditions other than schizophrenia has resulted in millions of additional individuals at risk for developing TD. Recognition of TD requires careful observation; a structured approach using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale is encouraged. Harm reduction can be achieved by using antipsychotics judiciously when possible and by paying attention to other modifiable risk factors such as drug-induced parkinsonian symptoms and the use of anticholinergic medication. Once TD has emerged and is associated with dysfunction or distress, treatment with a VMAT2 inhibitor such as deutetrabenazine or valbenazine is well supported by several controlled clinical trials.

### Abnormal involuntary movement scale in tardive dyskinesia: minimal clinically important difference [^7b3a6fc5]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that is associated with exposure to an antipsychotic or other dopamine receptor blocking agent (DRBA), such as metoclopramide. 1, 2 Despite the development and widespread use of second‐generation antipsychotics, TD remains a relevant potential risk of DRBAs. 3, 4, 5, 6 Two medications, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, are now approved for the treatment of TD in adults. The placebo‐controlled clinical trials of these drugs had some differences in study design (e.g. treatment duration, eligibility criteria), but both used the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 7 to measure the presence, severity, and changes in TD. Results from the valbenazine and deutetrabenazine trials showed that both compounds had measurable and statistically significant benefits as assessed by mean changes in AIMS total score. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Although the mean change in AIMS total score is a current standard for evaluating efficacy in clinical trials, the implications of this outcome for everyday practice are unclear. Along with other analytical approaches (e.g. Cohen's effect size, number needed to treat [NNT]), one way to estimate clinical relevance of recent TD trial results would be to identify a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the AIMS total score. Two approaches are generally used to estimate MCIDs: distribution‐based, which relies on a standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the measurement; and anchor‐based, which uses an external measure (e.g. 7‐point global assessment scale) as an independent criterion for improvement. 13, 14, 15 An MCID for the AIMS has not been established in patients with TD, possibly because of the lack of large, well‐controlled, and prospectively designed studies in this population. With the completion of three randomized controlled trials with valbenazine, a data set is now available that includes AIMS results for > 350 study participants. Moreover, this data set includes Clinical Global Impression of Change‐Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI‐TD) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) results, which may be appropriate anchor scales for estimating an MCID.

### Tetrabenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia [^48f82a8b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tetrabenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-September 2010) and The Cochrane Library using the terms tetrabenazine, tardive dyskinesia, and movement disorders. In addition, references from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Options available for the management of tardive dyskinesia are limited. Tetrabenazine is a central monoamine-depleting agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration for chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Three prospective studies of tetrabenazine in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia were identified, as well as 8 additional trials, 1 case series, and 8 case reports. Tetrabenazine may provide benefit in managing symptoms of tardive dyskinesia unresponsive to other treatment modalities. Treatment of tardive dyskinesia with tetrabenazine may be limited by cost and clinically significant adverse effects such as depression, parkinsonism, and somnolence.

Conclusions

Small trials indicate tetrabenazine may be effective for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. However, larger, well-conducted trials are needed to confirm these findings. Currently, there is a lack of data coupled with the risk of significant adverse effects to recommend the routine use of tetrabenazine in the management of tardive dyskinesia. Before using tetrabenazine for the management of tardive dyskinesia, all other options should be exhausted and careful monitoring employed.

5.5 Tardive
Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, CAPLYTA should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on CAPLYTA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with CAPLYTA despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Epidemiology of tardive dyskinesia: is risk declining with modern antipsychotics? [^9e545896]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs (APDs), including aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone dominate outpatient and inpatient clinical practice, having largely displaced the older neuroleptics. Modern APDs have relatively low risk for acute extrapyramidal syndromes characteristic of older neuroleptics, particularly acute dystonia and Parkinsonism, with variable risks of akathisia and the rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Anticipated reduction in risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) is less well documented. Nearly 50 years after initial reports on TD, it is appropriate to reexamine the epidemiology of this potentially severe late adverse effect of long-term APD treatment in light of current research and practice. We compared recent estimates of incidence and prevalence of TD identified with some modern APDs to the epidemiology of TD in the earlier neuroleptic era. Such comparisons are confounded by complex modern APD regimens, uncommon exposure limited to a single modern APD, effects of previous exposure to typical neuroleptics, and neurological assessments that are rarely prospective or systematic. Available evidence suggests that the risk of TD may be declining, but longitudinal studies of patients never treated with traditional neuroleptics and exposed to only a single modern APD are required to quantify TD risks with specific drugs. Long-term use of APDs should continue to be based on research-supported indications, with regular specific examination for emerging TD.

### How to assess tardive dyskinesia symptom improvement with measurement-based care [^4678726a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

​​​​​​ Clinicians now have 2 effective and well-tolerated vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors-valbenazine and deutetrabenazine-for the treatment of patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD), a severe and potentially irreversible side effect associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents. Clinicians should use measurement-based care, eg, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale with activation maneuvers, to assess and document TD symptoms and treatment progress. Each follow-up visit should be personalized with questions related to patients' functioning and level of distress regarding their specific TD symptoms. Family members, if available, can provide information on symptom changes and assistance with medication adherence. With continued treatment and measurement-based care, patients can experience improvement in their TD symptoms.

### Clozapine [^0fe8600e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.18 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome.

There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.

5.19 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions

In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.

5.20 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine

If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including SAPHRIS. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

There is no known treatment for tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, SAPHRIS should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of TD appear in a patient on SAPHRIS, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with SAPHRIS despite the presence of the syndrome.

Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, ziprasidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ziprasidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ziprasidone despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Motor symptoms of schizophrenia: is tardive dyskinesia a symptom or side effect? A modern treatment [^3b23855c]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Abnormal involuntary dyskinetic movements in schizophrenia patients have been documented for more than 140 years. Clinicians should distinguish between two kinds of disturbances-spontaneous dyskinetic movements and movements induced by psychotropic medications-which may look familiar clinically. As a modern term, tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a potentially permanent neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder that occurs after months or years of taking psychotropic drugs. Several distinct forms of TD exist, specifically tardive akathisia, tardive blepharospasm, tardive dystonia, tardive gait, tardive myoclonus, tardive tremor, and tardive tics, and they have different pathophysiologies and treatment. The pathogenesis of TD remains unclear, and the pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. Moreover, there is solid evidence of a genetic predisposition to TD. This article summarizes recent relevant publications concerning TD and the most recent studies regarding treatment of this disorder with antioxidative agents.

### Pyridoxal 5 phosphate for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia [^2865b465]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tardive dyskinesia is a chronic and disabling abnormal movement disorder affecting the muscles of the face, neck, tongue and the limbs. It is a common side effect of long-term antipsychotic medication use in individuals with schizophrenia and other related psychotic disorders. While there are no known effective treatments for tardive dyskinesia to date, some reports suggest that pyridoxal 5 phosphate may be effective in reducing the severity of tardive dyskinesia symptoms.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of pyridoxal 5 phosphate (vitamin B6 or Pyridoxine or Pyridoxal phosphate) in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia among people with schizophrenia and other related psychotic disorders.

Search Methods

The Cochrane schizophrenia group's register of clinical trials was searched (January 2013) using the phrase: [*Pyridoxal* OR *Pyridoxine* OR *P5P* OR *PLP* OR *tardoxal* OR *Vitamin B6* O *Vitamin B 6* R in title, abstract or index terms of REFERENCE, or interventions of STUDY. References of relevant identified studies were handsearched and where necessary, the first authors of relevant studies were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Studies described as randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness pyridoxal 5 phosphate with placebo in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia among patients with schizophrenia.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently extracted data from each selected study. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a fixed-effect model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs, again based on a fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate quality of evidence.

Main Results

Of the 12 records retrieved by the search, three trials published in 2001, 2003 and 2007, involving 80 inpatients with schizophrenia, aged 18 to 71 years, admitted in a psychiatric facility and followed up for a period nine weeks to 26 weeks, were included. Overall, pyridoxal 5 phosphate produced a significant improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms when compared with placebo, assessed by a change in Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS) scores from baseline to the end of the first phase of the included studies (2 RCTs n = 65, RR 19.97, CI 2.87 to 139.19, low quality evidence). The endpoint tardive dyskinesia score (a measure of its severity) assessed with the ESRS, was significantly lower among participants on pyridoxal 5 phosphate compared to those on placebo (2 RCTs n = 60, MD -4.07, CI -6.36 to -1.79, low quality evidence). It was unclear whether pyridoxal 5 phosphate led to more side effects (n = 65, 2 RCTs, RR 3.97, CI 0.20 to 78.59, low quality evidence) or caused deterioration in tardive dyskinesia symptoms when compared to placebo (n = 65, 2 RCTs, RR 0.16, CI 0.01 to 3.14, low quality evidence). Five participants taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate withdrew from the study because they were not willing to take more medications while none of the participants taking placebo discontinued their medications (n = 65, 2 RCTs, RR 8.72, CI 0.51 to 149.75, low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the endpoint positive and negative psychiatric symptoms scores, measured using the Positive and Negative symptoms Scale (PANSS) between participants taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate and those taking placebo. For the positive symptoms: (n = 15, 1 RCT, MD -1.50, CI -4.80 to 1.80, low quality evidence). For negative the symptoms: (n = 15, 1 RCT, MD -1.10, CI -5.92 to 3.72, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Pyridoxal 5 phosphate may have some benefits in reducing the severity of tardive dyskinesia symptoms among individuals with schizophrenia. However, the quality of evidence supporting the effectiveness of pyridoxal 5 phosphate in treating tardive dyskinesia is low, based on few studies, short follow-up periods, small sample sizes and inadequate adherence to standardised reporting guidelines for randomised controlled trials among the included studies.

### NBI-98854, a selective monoamine transport inhibitor for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^9a547830]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a persistent movement disorder that occurs after chronic neuroleptic exposure. Although early studies suggested that the incidence of TD associated with atypical antipsychotic medications was lower than that reported with high‐dose first‐generation antipsychotics, more recent studies suggest that the actual incidence of may be comparable. 1, 2 Classical TD is characterized most commonly by involuntary movements of the orofacial region and choreoathetoid movements in the extremities and trunk, but other forms also exist. 3 Although at times TD may be of mild intensity, moderate to severe TD can be disabling, significantly impact day‐to‐day functioning and quality of life, and occasionally is life threatening. 4 The standard tool for assessment of dyskinesia is the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), first developed in the 1970s. 5

No definitive treatment algorithm or approved drug for TD exists in the United States. Although some proposed treatments are based on anecdotal evidence or small blinded trials (e.g. levetiracetam), 6 others have failed to demonstrate efficacy in larger controlled trials (e.g. vitamin E, amantadine). 7, 8 The first step in treatment is generally to stop or minimize the use of the neuroleptic drug suspected of causing the condition 9; however, this is not always possible because it may result in an acute exacerbation of TD symptoms and an increased risk for harmful psychiatric decompensation. 10 Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, is approved for use in TD patients in some countries and has been used "off label" in the United States. 3

### Randomized controlled trial of deutetrabenazine for tardive dyskinesia: the ARM-TD study [^3c73477b]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Primary research question.

Is deutetrabenazine effective at reducing the severity of abnormal involuntary movements of TD as measured using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score? This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with TD, deutetrabenazine reduces AIMS scores.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

This phase II/III trial is registered at(NCT02195700). Written approval of the study protocol was obtained from the independent ethics committee at each site. Informed consent was secured for each patient. This study was conducted from June 2014 to May 2015.

Patient population.

Participants had a TD diagnosis for ≥ 3 months before screening and a history of DRA treatment for ≥ 3 months (≥ 1 month if age ≥ 60 years). Patients were required to have investigator-assessed total AIMS motor score ≥ 6 (examination of items 1–7) at both screening and baseline, verified by a blinded central rater at screening. For logistic reasons, the video of the AIMS motor score at baseline could not be assessed by blinded central rating until after randomization. Psychoactive medication use, including antipsychotics, was allowed if stable for ≥ 30 days before screening (antidepressants ≥ 45 days).

Treatment with tetrabenazine, reserpine, α-methyl-p-tyrosine, strong anticholinergic medications, metoclopramide, dopamine agonists, levodopa, and/or stimulants within 30 days of screening or baseline was exclusionary, as was treatment with botulinum toxin within 3 months of screening. Other exclusions included presence of a neurologic condition that could confound TD assessments, serious untreated or undertreated psychiatric illness, or unstable medical illness. Patients with history of or active suicidal ideation or behavior within 6 months of screening or score ≥ 11 on the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were excluded. A corrected QT interval with the Fridericia formula (QTcF) of > 450 milliseconds in men or > 460 milliseconds in women on 12-lead ECG at screening was also exclusionary.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia [^1bd735f6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine in patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD).

Method

Patients with TD who completed the 12 week, phase 3, placebo-controlled trials were eligible to enter this open-label, single-arm study. The open-label study consisted of a 6 week dose-escalation phase and a long-term maintenance phase (clinic visits at Weeks 4, 6 and 15, and every 13 weeks until Week 106). Patients began deutetrabenazine at 12 mg/day, titrating up to a dose that was tolerable and provided adequate dyskinesia control, based on investigator judgement, with a maximum allowed dose of 48 mg/day (36 mg/day for patients taking strong cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors). Safety measures included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and scales used to monitor parkinsonism, akathisia/restlessness, anxiety, depression, suicidality and somnolence/sedation. Efficacy endpoints included the change in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score (items 1 to 7) from baseline and the proportion of patients rated as 'Much Improved' or 'Very Much Improved' on the Clinical Global Impression of Change.

Results

A total of 343 patients enrolled in the extension study, and there were 331 patient-years of exposure in this analysis. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AEs with long-term treatment were comparable to or lower than those observed in the phase 3 trials. The mean (SE) change in AIMS score was –4.9 (0.4) at Week 54 (n = 146), – 6.3 (0.7) at Week 80 (n = 66) and –5.1 (2.0) at Week 106 (n = 8).

Conclusions

Overall, long-term treatment with deutetrabenazine was efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in patients with TD.

Five patients with tardive dyskinesia were treated with a central dopamine blocking agent, metoclopramide hydrochloride. The duration of symptoms ranged from four to 30 months. A pretreatment disability score was graded for buccolingual, extremity, and truncal movements and for duration of tongue protrusion. A 59% improvement was achieved in total disability scores. Tongue protrusion demonstrated the most noticeable improvement. The average daily dosage ranged from a minimum of 20 mg to a maximum of 80 mg given in divided doses. Duration of follow-up ranged from three to eight months. Preliminary data suggest that metoclopramide may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia.

5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients
	treated with antipsychotic drugs, including SECUADO. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women,
	but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ
	in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increases with the duration
	of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses.
	It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment
	itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying
	process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, SECUADO should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to reduce the risk of tardive
	dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that
	is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and (2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are
	not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of
	treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on SECUADO, drug discontinuation should be considered.
	However, some patients may require treatment with SECUADO despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Medication options and clinical strategies for treating tardive dyskinesia [^3c04fc8a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Valbenazine and deutetrabenazine are FDA-approved as treatment for tardive dyskinesia (TD). Both medications are vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, and both are effective for reducing TD symptoms. Clinicians need to be aware of the adverse effects of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, as well as other key differences between the two, in order to individualize treatment. Using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale assists clinicians in assessing progress for each patient. Treating TD effectively with these new medications will reduce the burden of the condition for patients.

Although VMAT2-inhibitors are now established as first-line treatment for tardive dyskinesia, not all patients respond to, or tolerate them. Numerous other agents have been adopted to treat tardive dyskinesia, but with variable results and generally lower quality methodologic reports. Amantadine is the most promising but benzodiazepines, branched chain neutral amino acids, Vitamin B6, several nutraceuticals, and botulinum toxin injections might help some patients. In all cases, better placebo controlled trials are needed before definitive recommendations can be made.

### Tardive syndromes [^b54af0a6]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dopamine receptor﻿-blocking antipsychotics, first introduced into clinical practice in 1952, were hailed as a panacea in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. However, within 5 years, this notion was to be shattered by the recognition of both acute and chronic drug-induced movement disorders which can accompany their administration. Tardive syndromes, denoting the delayed onset of movement disorders following administration of dopamine receptor-blocking (and also other) drugs, have diverse manifestations ranging from the classic oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia, through dystonic craniocervical and trunk posturing, to abnormal breathing patterns. Although tardive syndromes have been an important part of movement disorder clinical practice for over 60 years, their pathophysiologic basis remains poorly understood and the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. This review summarises the current knowledge relating to these syndromes and provides clinicians with pragmatic, clinically focused guidance to their management.

RESULTS

Patient baseline characteristics and disposition.

A total of 117 patients with TD were randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 58) or placebo (n = 59). A comparable proportion of patients completed the study in both groups (figure 1). Both groups had similar demographics and baseline characteristics (table 1). Approximately 70% of the population had an underlying diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (table 1); 23.1% had bipolar disorder; and 25.6% had depression. The majority of patients (80.3%) were being treated with a DRA at baseline and continued treatment throughout the study.

Figure 1
Flow of study patients

After screening for eligibility, 117 patients were randomized to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo. A total of 89.7% and 88.1% of patients completed 12 weeks of treatment with deutetrabenazine or placebo, respectively.

Table 1
Patient baseline characteristics by treatment group

Dose.

At the end of the titration period, the mean (SD) total daily dose was 38.8 (7.92) mg/d. The mean [SD] dose remained stable until the end of the treatment period (38.3 [7.97] mg/d).

Efficacy assessments.

For the primary endpoint, deutetrabenazine significantly reduced AIMS scores from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo (least-squares [LS] mean [standard error (SE)]: −3.0 [0.45] vs −1.6 [0.46], p = 0.019; treatment difference −1.4 [0.60], 95% confidence interval [CI] −2.6 to −0.2) (figure 2). Improvement in AIMS score was different between the deutetrabenazine and placebo groups by week 4 with a treatment effect of −1.5 (95% CI −2.6 to −0.4, p = 0.007).

### Randomized controlled trial of deutetrabenazine for tardive dyskinesia: the ARM-TD study [^dff50ca0]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated that deutetrabenazine is efficacious for the treatment of abnormal movements in patients with TD, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile that enables the continued use of DRAs and antidepressants for the management of chronic psychiatric conditions. Almost all patients (98.3%) enrolled in Aim to Reduce Movements in Tardive Dyskinesia (ARM-TD) had an underlying psychiatric comorbidity for which they were receiving concomitant medications, making these results especially relevant to clinical practice for clinicians managing similar patients in a real-world setting.

In general, deutetrabenazine was well tolerated, as supported by the high study completion rate and infrequent dose reductions, dose suspensions, or withdrawals. These results are of particular importance because antipsychotic discontinuation or dose reduction is often not possible for patients with TD because of the high risk of psychotic exacerbation. Moreover, deutetrabenazine did not result in reports of depression or suicidal ideation and was associated with low rates of psychiatric AEs, including anxiety.

Because of possible differences between on-site and centralized video ratings of TD, natural variation in the severity of dyskinesia, and potential differences among patients' subjective feelings (e.g. more nervous during the initial video) at screening vs baseline, 20 enrolled patients had AIMS scores < 6 as assessed by a central video rater at baseline, leaving 97 patients (85.8% of the mITT population) with central video AIMS scores ≥ 6 at both screening and baseline. Because this population is consistent with the intended study population, the key efficacy endpoints were assessed for this group to inform future study design. As with the mITT population, a significant improvement in AIMS score at week 12 was also observed with deutetrabenazine compared with placebo for this population. Deutetrabenazine provided greater clinical benefit, as evidenced by numeric improvement on CGIC, in patients with a central video AIMS score ≥ 6 at screening and baseline, suggesting that patients with more severe TD may exhibit better clinical response.

### Reemergence of tardive dyskinesia after discontinuation of clozapine treatment [^0c2023f5]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) continues to be a significant health problem and a serious limitation to neuroleptic medication treatment. Clozapine treatment may reduce the severity of TD but it is unclear wether the medication temporarily suppresses symptoms or leads to a sustain resolution of the disorder. Herein we describe two cases with severe TD which clozapine had to be discontinued. These cases suggest that clozapine provides a temporary suppression of TD rather than a permanent resolution of the disorder.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies have improved our knowledge of the factors responsible for the development of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease and the associated pathophysiology. Deep brain stimulation has been shown to be effective to treat severe tardive dyskinesias. This review highlights some recent findings related to levodopa-induced and antipsychotic-induced dyskinesias.

Recent Findings

The reported advantage of using a dopamine agonist as an initial treatment to prevent the development of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease appears to be less evident after a long-term follow-up. Other factors, related to the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease or to patients' endophenotypes, are beginning to be identified. Several brain changes have been found to be associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesias. PET studies have evidenced an increased level of synaptic dopamine in the striatum. Neurophysiological studies have suggested that dyskinesias might reflect abnormal skill memorization processes within the cortico-subcortical loops. A dysfunction of the mechanisms trying to compensate for dopamine deficiency and its brain consequences could be responsible for these changes induced by the dopaminergic treatment. Bilateral pallidal stimulation has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for severe tardive dyskinesias.

Summary

These findings will improve future strategies to prevent and treat Parkinson's disease dyskinesias and offer a much needed treatment for severe tardive dyskinesias.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia [^a8da7d84]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design

This open-label, single-arm, long-term study of deutetrabenazine in patients with TD (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02198794) was conducted at 76 centres in the USA and Europe. Patients with TD who successfully completed one of the phase 3 trials (ARM-TD and AIM-TD) were eligible to roll over into this open-label study. All patients were washed out from the phase 3 study drug (deutetrabenazine or placebo) for at least 1 week and began deutetrabenazine at 12 mg/day (6 mg twice daily), regardless of prior treatment. Deutetrabenazine dose was then increased weekly by 6 mg/day over the first 6 weeks of treatment (dose-escalation phase) until adequate dyskinesia control was achieved with good tolerability. All treatment regimens were administered twice daily, approximately 10 hours apart. The maximum total daily dosage was 48 mg/day, unless patients were taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (paroxetine, fluoxetine or bupropion), in which case maximum dose was 36 mg/day. Patients continued this established dose into the long-term treatment period. The data for this long-term analysis was 5 April, 2017.

Study participants

Study participants successfully completed either the ARM-TD or AIM-TD trial, defined as participation through Week 13; compliance with study drug and procedures, in the opinion of the investigator; and the absence of ongoing AEs that are serious or severe in intensity, or are expected to interfere with participation in this study. Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously described.

Each patient, or their legally authorised representative, signed and dated an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee-approved Informed Consent Form.

Blinding

This was an open-label study and was therefore not blinded.

### A randomized controlled trial of risperidone and olanzapine for schizophrenic patients with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia [^fde440b7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of risperidone and olanzapine in schizophrenic patients with tardive dyskinesia on treatment with first-generation antipsychotics.

Method

We conducted a 24-week, rater-blinded, flexible-dose study. Sixty patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (n = 58) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 2) met the DSM-IV research criteria for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia and were randomly assigned to a risperidone or olanzapine group. The primary outcome was a comparison of the change in the total scores on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) from baseline to study end point between the groups. The study was conducted from July 2000 to June 2004.

Results

The mean ± SD doses of risperidone and olanzapine from baseline to study end point were 1.9 ± 0.7 to 4.1 ± 1.4 mg/d and 8.1 ± 2.0 to 12.6 ± 5.4 mg/d, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data, severity of tardive dyskinesia, or psychotic symptoms between risperidone and olanzapine groups at baseline assessment. Both groups showed significant improvement in mean ± SD AIMS total scores (risperidone: −7.4 ± 6.9, P < .0001; olanzapine: −6.2 ± 8.0, P = 0.0002). However, there was a more statistically significant change in the slope of AIMS total scores in the risperidone group than in the olanzapine group (P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrated that olanzapine may not have better potential for tardive dyskinesia improvement than risperidone did. Double-blinded, fixed dose studies with a larger sample size on schizophrenic patients with tardive dyskinesia from different ethnic groups are needed to confirm the results of our study.

### NBI-98854, a selective monoamine transport inhibitor for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^6968fd35]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NBI‐98854 administered at 25 mg to 75 mg once daily for 6 weeks was associated with a marked reduction in TD severity as assessed by both the AIMS and CGI‐TD and supported by the PGIC. The improvement in dyskinesia (LS mean change from baseline of –2.6 points on NBI‐98854 vs. –0.2 points on placebo; mITT) reflects a greater than 30% reduction in AIMS score. The magnitude of effect is clinically meaningful, especially when looking at responders, that is, greater than 50% reduction in AIMS, and the corresponding CGI‐TD scores of 2 or 1, which reflect the categories of "much improved" or "very much improved".

This trial design included a unique method for the objective assessment of tardive dyskinesia. The use of movement disorder neurologists as central AIMS video raters appears to be appropriate for TD clinical trials, with excellent sensitivity to detect change. When using random‐sequence video scoring, the potential for placebo and sequence effects appears to be minimized.

Subjects with underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder receiving concomitant psychotropic polypharmacy appeared to tolerate NBI‐98854 well at these doses. No adverse events were seen related to depression or worsening of psychiatric safety scales. The absence of signs of monoamine depletion is notable given the shared mechanism of action with tetrabenazine, a VMAT2 inhibitor administered three times daily and approved in some countries for use in TD patients. No large, placebo‐controlled trials of TBZ for TD have been published. However, safety and tolerability data for TBZ are available from a controlled trial in Huntington's disease. 22 In that pivotal HD trial, adverse events were common during the TBZ titration phase, with dose reductions required because of sedation, akathisia, parkinsonism, and depression. NBI‐98854, with once daily dosing and the potential for low rates of these particular adverse events, may be a useful alternative therapy. A formal comparison trial with adequate long‐term administration would be the only way to compare safety and tolerability of these medications.

### Comparative assessment of the incidence and severity of tardive dyskinesia in patients receiving aripiprazole or haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia: a post hoc analysis [^a5f2eb06]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To comparatively assess the incidence of tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia receiving either aripiprazole or haloperidol.

Method

Data from 2 controlled, long-term trials of subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia treated with aripiprazole (N = 861, 20–30 mg/day) or haloperidol (N = 433, 5–10 mg/day) were analyzed. The primary outcome measure was the rate of new-onset tardive dyskinesia. The analysis was limited to patients without baseline tardive dyskinesia. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in demographic or disease characteristics. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Research Diagnostic Criteria for tardive dyskinesia were used to define the comparative incidence rates of long-term treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia.

Results

A significantly lower percentage of aripiprazole-treated patients developed new-onset tardive dyskinesia compared with haloperidol-treated patients (p < .0001). The annualized rate of treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia was significantly lower in aripiprazole-treated versus haloperidol-treated patients. In patients without a baseline diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia, aripiprazole significantly improved AIMS scores compared with haloperidol (p ≤ .0001).

Conclusion

These findings support the potential for a significantly lower risk of tardive dyskinesia with aripiprazole than with haloperidol among patients requiring maintenance antipsychotic treatment.

14.2 Tardive Dyskinesia

The efficacy of AUSTEDO in the treatment for tardive dyskinesia was established in two 12‑week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trials conducted in 335 adult ambulatory patients with tardive dyskinesia caused by use of dopamine receptor antagonists. Patients had a history of using a dopamine receptor antagonist (antipsychotics, metoclopramide) for at least 3 months (or 1 month in patients 60 years of age and older). Concurrent diagnoses included schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (62%) and mood disorder (33%). With respect to concurrent antipsychotic use, 64% of patients were receiving atypical antipsychotics, 12% were receiving typical or combination antipsychotics, and 24% were not receiving antipsychotics.

The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) was the primary efficacy measure for the assessment of tardive dyskinesia severity. The AIMS is a 12-item scale; items 1 to 7 assess the severity of involuntary movements across body regions and these items were used in this study. Each of the 7 items was scored on a 0 to 4 scale, rated as: 0 = not present; 1 = minimal, may be extreme normal (abnormal movements occur infrequently and/or are difficult to detect); 2 = mild (abnormal movements occur infrequently and are easy to detect); 3 = moderate (abnormal movements occur frequently and are easy to detect) or 4 = severe (abnormal movements occur almost continuously and/or of extreme intensity). The AIMS total score (sum of items 1 to 7) could thus range from 0 to 28, with a decrease in score indicating improvement.

5.17 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe VERSACLOZ in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with VERSACLOZ despite the presence of the syndrome.

TD may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.

5.18 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions

In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for VERSACLOZ or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. VERSACLOZ should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.

5.19 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of VERSACLOZ

If abrupt discontinuation of VERSACLOZ is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

### FDA approves first drug to treat tardive dyskinesia… [^32fa5f42]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Ingrezza capsules to treat adults with tardive dyskinesia. This is the first drug approved by the FDA for this condition. Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive involuntary movements, usually of the jaw, lips and tongue, such as grimacing, sticking out the tongue and smacking the lips. Some affected people also experience involuntary movement of the extremities or difficulty breathing. "Tardive dyskinesia can be disabling and can further stigmatize patients with mental illness, " said Mitchell Mathis, M. D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Approving the first drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is an important advance for patients suffering with this condition".

Tardive dyskinesia is a serious side effect sometimes seen in patients who have been treated with antipsychotic medications, especially the older medications, for long periods to treat chronic conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Tardive dyskinesia can also occur in patients taking antipsychotic medications for depression and certain medications for gastrointestinal disorders and other conditions. It is unclear why some people who take these medications develop tardive dyskinesia yet others do not. The efficacy of Ingrezza was shown in a clinical trial of 234 participants that compared Ingrezza to placebo. After six weeks, participants who received Ingrezza had improvement in the severity of abnormal involuntary movements compared to those who received placebo. Ingrezza may cause serious side effects including sleepiness and heart rhythm problems.

Its use should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with abnormal heartbeats associated with a prolonged QT interval. Those taking Ingrezza should not drive or operate heavy machinery or do other dangerous activities until it is known how the drug affects them. The FDA granted this application Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. The FDA granted approval of Ingrezza to Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. Related Information Inquiries

### Abnormal involuntary movement scale in tardive dyskinesia: minimal clinically important difference [^4800e188]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the AIMS itself should also be considered. Given that the AIMS total score is the current "gold standard" for evaluating efficacy in TD clinical trials, determining an MCID based on this measure is a reasonable endeavor. However, the AIMS does not capture the social and functional deficits associated with TD. In addition, one‐time or episodic complications related to TD, such as a fall related to gait problems, are not adequately captured by the AIMS. Improvements in these domains must be considered along with dyskinetic movements when determining whether a patient is experiencing clinically meaningful improvements. Methodologies for administering and scoring the AIMS should also be considered. The proposed MCIDs presented in this report are based on AIMS evaluations that were scored by consensus between two central video raters (movement disorder specialists) who were blinded to treatment and study visit. In clinical settings, the AIMS is administered and assessed in real time by a physician or other qualified professional who knows what the patient is taking and how long he or she has been treated. Therefore, an MCID based on clinical trial data, as investigated in this report, should be considered as more of a guideline (rather than an imperative) for everyday practice. Given that the analyses in this report are limited to valbenazine data, they may not be generalizable to all AIMS results, including those that have been reported in other TD clinical trials (e.g. deutetrabenazine). Applying the proposed MCIDs from this report to other TD trials should also be done with caution given that differences in study design (e.g. double‐blind vs. open‐label, treatment duration, eligibility criteria, and allowance of concomitant medications) may affect treatment outcomes.

### Tardive dyskinesia: out of the shadows [^707facab]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The approvals of the first two medications, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, to treat tardive dyskinesia have ushered in a new era in neuropsychiatric care. Tardive syndromes are defined as delayed onset, persistent movement disorders or sensory phenomena that occur in association with exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Their underlying pathophysiology remains to be fully elucidated, but clinicians can conceptualize tardive syndromes as persistent dopamine supersensitivity states. Tardive syndromes can potentially cause distress, disfigurement, embarrassment, and dysfunction, and are often permanent. Therefore, practitioners who prescribe DRBAs should be aware of this potential, carefully assess the risk/benefit ratio when considering the use of these medications, and be sure that patients are appropriately informed. Patients on DRBAs should be monitored for the development of tardive syndromes, including through the use of regularly scheduled Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (or similar) examinations. Clinicians prescribing DRBAs should be familiar with the diagnosis and management of tardive syndromes, and be able to institute treatment or refer patients when treatment is appropriate. Future research may focus on the potential benefit of earlier introduction of VMAT2 inhibitors to delay onset or progression of tardive syndromes. More effective treatments are still needed, as are effective, well-tolerated antipsychotics that do not cause tardive syndromes.

### KINECT 3: a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of valbenazine for tardive dyskinesia [^df569fed]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Tardive dyskinesia is a persistent movement disorder induced by dopamine receptor blockers, including antipsychotics. Valbenazine (NBI-98854) is a novel, highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor that demonstrated favorable efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in phase 2 studies. This phase 3 study further evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valbenazine as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.

Method

This 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a mood disorder who had moderate or severe tardive dyskinesia. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to once-daily placebo, valbenazine at 40 mg/day, or valbenazine at 80 mg/day. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in the 80 mg/day group compared with the placebo group on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) dyskinesia score (items 1–7), as assessed by blinded central AIMS video raters. Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, laboratory tests, ECG, and psychiatric measures.

Results

The intent-to-treat population included 225 participants, of whom 205 completed the study. Approximately 65% of participants had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 85.5% were receiving concomitant antipsychotics. Least squares mean change from baseline to week 6 in AIMS dyskinesia score was -3.2 for the 80 mg/day group, compared with -0.1 for the placebo group, a significant difference. AIMS dyskinesia score was also reduced in the 40 mg/day group (-1.9 compared with -0.1). The incidence of adverse events was consistent with previous studies.

Conclusions

Once-daily valbenazine significantly improved tardive dyskinesia in participants with underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or mood disorder. Valbenazine was generally well tolerated, and psychiatric status remained stable. Longer trials are necessary to understand the long-term effects of valbenazine in patients with tardive dyskinesia.

### Gastroparesis, metoclopramide, and tardive dyskinesia: risk revisited [^0b25c65a]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metoclopramide is primarily a dopamine receptor antagonist, with 5HT 3 receptor antagonist and 5HT 4 receptor agonist activity, and used as an antiemetic and gastroprokinetic since almost 50 years. Regulatory authorities issued restrictions and recommendations regarding long-term use of the drug at oral doses exceeding 10 mg 3–4 times daily because of the risk for development of tardive dyskinesia. The aim of our study was to review mechanism(s) of action and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties of metoclopramide, as well as the risk of metoclopramide-induced tardive dyskinesia, factors that may change drug exposure in humans, and to summarize the clinical context for appropriate use of the drug.

Methods

A PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cross Reference search was done using the key words and combined searches: drug-drug interaction, gastroparesis, metoclopramide, natural history, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interaction, outcome, risk factors, tardive dyskinesia.

Key Results

Data show that the risk of tardive dyskinesia from metoclopramide is low, in the range of 0.1% per 1000 patient years. This is far below a previously estimated 1%-10% risk suggested in treatment guidelines by regulatory authorities. High-risk groups are elderly females, diabetics, patients with liver or kidney failure, and patients with concomitant antipsychotic drug therapy, which reduces the threshold for neurological complications.

Conclusions & Inferences

The risk of tardive dyskinesia due to metoclopramide is far below approximated numbers in treatment guidelines. This risk and the influence of known risk factors should be considered when starting a course of metoclopramide for treatment of gastroparesis.

### VMAT2 inhibitors for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia [^73a34452]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an often disabling hyperkinetic movement disorder caused by exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents. Although initially thought to most commonly occur with typical antipsychotics, the incidence is likely similar with atypical antipsychotics and antiemetics such as metoclopramide. Increased prescribing of these agents as well as low rates of remission have contributed to a rising prevalence of TD. Although this condition was described nearly 60 years ago, it is only within the past year that two novel therapeutic agents were FDA approved. Characterization of the VMAT2 inhibitor tetrabenazine, which was identified as a therapeutic agent for TD in older clinical trials, has yielded two distinct pharmacologic strategies to optimize response. The first strategy, used to create deutetrabenazine, employed deuterization of tetrabenazine to stabilize the pharmacokinetics and eliminate high peak plasma levels. The second strategy was the creation of a prodrug, valbenazine, for the two most active isoforms of tetrabenazine that also resulted in more stable pharmacokinetics and eliminated peak plasma levels. Both agents have been demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of TD in multicenter, controlled trials and their development has led to a resurgence of interest in the characterization and treatment of this movement disorder.

Long-term deutetrabenazine treatment also provided meaningful improvements in TD symptoms. While improvements in TD were noted by Week 2 based on the AIMS score, continued gradual improvement was seen through Week 106, which may be partially due to patient dropout. Similarly, a prior open-label study (mean follow-up time; 20.3 weeks, N = 20) showed a 54.2% improvement in the mean AIMS score with tetrabenazine treatment. The improvement of TD symptoms observed in the present study was recognised by clinicians, who rated 45% of patients at Week 4 and 70% of patients at Week 80 as 'Much Improved' or 'Very Much Improved' according to the CGIC assessment. CGIC results for a previous open-label tetrabenazine study (mean follow-up time: 22 months) were consistent with these results, with 41.2% of patients reporting similar improvement, although the study was small (patients with TD: n = 17). Improvement was not limited to that observed by clinicians; the majority of patients in our study also recognised improvement in their TD severity, as measured by the proportion of patients who reported themselves as 'Much Improved' or 'Very Much Improved' on the PGIC scale as early as Week 4 (44%), gradually increasing to 68% at Week 106. Quality of life measures, based on the mCDQ-24, showed improvements with long-term maintenance therapy. The consistent improvements across all efficacy assessments (AIMS, CGIC, PGIC and mCDQ-24) support the long-term clinical utility of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of TD.

This study's open-label treatment design poses some inherent limitations. Given the lack of a control group, all outcomes were considered descriptive rather than inferential. This study used site-rated AIMS scores rather than the blinded central video ratings employed in the ARM-TD and AIM-TD studies. We cannot know whether the increased benefit over time was due to rating bias or whether it would still be apparent if blinded central video ratings or a control group had been used.

Overall, this open-label extension study demonstrated that deutetrabenazine was generally efficacious, safe and well tolerated in patients with TD, with improvements in AIMS scores, global improvement of TD severity, positive patient-reported outcomes and low rates of mainly mild-to-moderate AEs.

Study design.

This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study conducted at 46 sites in the United States and Europe. Patients were centrally randomized 1:1 to receive deutetrabenazine or matching placebo and stratified by use of DRA at baseline (currently taking vs not currently taking a DRA). Randomization and stratification were performed through an Interactive Technology Response System. Both patients and site investigators remained blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study.

After randomization, study drug was started at 12 mg/d (6 mg twice daily) and titrated weekly by 6 mg/d, if required, for up to 6 weeks until adequate dyskinesia control was achieved, a significant AE occurred, or the maximal allowable dose (48 mg/d) was reached; this was followed by maintenance (6 weeks) and a 1-week washout. The investigator, in consultation with the patient and caregiver (if applicable), determined the optimal dose for dyskinesia control. In patients receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, the maximum allowed dose of deutetrabenazine was 36 mg/d. Clinic visits and AIMS evaluations were performed at weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 13. Telephone consultations occurred at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7.

### The effects of valbenazine in participants with tardive dyskinesia: results of the 1-year KINECT 3 extension study [^b5afcbec]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Valbenazine, a highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. This is the first report of long-term effects in adults with tardive dyskinesia.

Methods

Participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a mood disorder who completed the 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of KINECT 3 were eligible to enter the 42-week valbenazine extension (VE) period and subsequent 4-week washout period. The extension phase was conducted from December 16, 2014, to August 3, 2016. Participants who received placebo and entered the VE period were re-randomized 1:1 to valbenazine 80 or 40 mg while others continued valbenazine at the KINECT 3 dose. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and scales for suicidal ideation/behavior, treatment-emergent akathisia or parkinsonism, and psychiatric symptoms. Efficacy assessments included the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Clinical Global Impression of Change-Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI-TD).

Results

198 participants entered the VE period, 124 (62.6%) completed treatment (week 48), and 121 (61.1%) completed the follow-up visit after washout (week 52). During the VE period, 69.2% of participants had ≥ 1 TEAE, 14.6% had a serious TEAE, and 15.7% discontinued due to a TEAE. During washout, 13.1% of participants experienced a TEAE. No apparent risk for suicidal ideation or behavior was found. Long-term valbenazine treatment did not appear to induce or worsen akathisia or parkinsonism. Participants generally remained psychiatrically stable during the study. AIMS and CGI-TD measures indicated sustained tardive dyskinesia improvement, with scores returning toward baseline after 4 weeks of valbenazine washout.

Conclusions

The long-term safety and tolerability of valbenazine were generally favorable, and maintenance of treatment effect was apparent with both doses during this long-term study.

### Historical perspective on movement disorders [^ffd7641b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Before atypical antipsychotics were developed, neuroleptics given to patients for the treatment of psychosis often caused movement disorders. Although the role of neuroleptics in the development of tardive dyskinesia was never certain, this adverse effect was of great concern to physicians because its effects could be irreversible and devastating to the patient. It is important to understand whether involuntary movement disorders are an intrinsic part of schizophrenia, because if so, then a certain percentage of patients will develop the dyskinetic syndromes whether they are treated or not. To uncover the role of antipsychotic medications in tardive dyskinesia, it is necessary to examine the descriptions of abnormal movements made by those who were first researching schizophrenia, as well as modern descriptions of neuroleptic-naïve individuals with schizophrenia. The physicians who initially described the syndrome of tardive dyskinesia had observed pre-neuroleptic schizophrenia first hand and saw a difference in the movements of treated and untreated patients. Nevertheless, the idea of a chronic movement disorder caused by treatment with neuroleptics would become controversial for many years. With the development of the atypical antipsychotics, the incidence and prevalence of tardive dyskinesia have dropped remarkably, suggesting that psychosis, its treatment, and dyskinesias are not inextricably linked.

### Risperidone for severe tardive dyskinesia: a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^e5314855]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone has been reported to alleviate the severity of tardive dyskinesia, but without placebo control, the possibility of spontaneous tardive dyskinesia remission after discontinuing original conventional antipsychotics cannot be excluded. This 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the effect of risperidone on severe tardive dyskinesia.

Method

Forty-nine DSM-IV schizophrenia patients with severe tardive dyskinesia were enrolled in the study. After a 4-week washout period, the subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with either risperidone or placebo. The risperidone dose was started at 2 mg/day and gradually increased to 6 mg/day over 6 weeks; the 6-mg/day dose was maintained for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. The subjects were evaluated every 2 weeks with the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. The final mental status was assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.

Results

Twenty-two subjects in the risperidone group and 20 subjects in the placebo group completed the study; the mean baseline AIMS total score for all subjects was 15.9 ± 4.6. At the end of the study, the mean AIMS total score decrease was 1.1 ± 4.8 in the placebo group and 5.5 ± 3.8 in the risperidone group (p < .05). Fifteen subjects (68%) in the risperidone group and 6 subjects (30%) in the placebo group were responders (p < .05). The risperidone responders had a mean AIMS total score decrease of 7.5 ± 2.1. More significant tardive dyskinesia improvement among the risperidone group was noted from the eighth week and was mainly demonstrated in the buccolinguomasticatory a rea rather than in choreoathetoid movement of the extremities (p < .001).

Conclusions

Risperidone, 6 mg/day, can improve tardive dyskinesia more significantly than discontinuing antipsychotics in patients with severe tardive dyskinesia, especially in the orofacial areas.

### Tardive syndromes [^04758a64]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Tardive syndromes are a group of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders that occur after some delay following exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents such as antipsychotic and anti-emetic drugs. The severity of these disorders ranges from mild to disabling or even life-threatening. There is a wide range of recognized tardive phenomenologies that may occur in isolation or in combination with each other. These phenomenologies include stereotypy, dystonia, chorea, akathisia, myoclonus, tremor, tics, gait disorders, parkinsonism, ocular deviations, respiratory dyskinesia, and a variety of sensory symptoms. Recognition of the various tardive phenomenologies may not only lead to early diagnosis but also to appropriate therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on the diagnosis and clinical course of tardive syndromes and how to distinguish between the various phenomenologies as well as how to differentiate them from other, similar but etiologically different, movement disorders.

### Abnormal involuntary movement scale in tardive dyskinesia: minimal clinically important difference [^9bd674ea]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although the AIMS total score is the current standard for determining efficacy in TD clinical trials, translating this outcome into clinical practice can be challenging. 16 To address that challenge, the TD Workshop participants discussed different ways to analyze AIMS data and identified the MCID as one possible approach. 17 Based on both clinician‐ and patient‐rated anchors of minimal improvement (CGI‐TD and PGIC score ≤ 3 at week 6), mean and median changes in AIMS total score (sum of items 1‐7) suggested an MCID of 2 points in adults with TD. Analyses based on more rigorous definitions of global improvement (CGI‐TD and PGIC score ≤ 2 at week 6) suggested a clinician‐based MCID of 3 points and a patient‐based MCID of 2 to 3 points. Clinically, these proposed MCIDs may be useful for interpreting the effects of treatment on TD. However, it may be worth noting that the MCID of 2 points is consistent with the distribution‐based approach that uses 0.5 times the baseline SD as a threshold for clinically meaningful change. 18 In the pooled data set, the SD of the mean AIMS total score at baseline in all participants was 4.2, which would correspond to an MCID of 2 points.

The current results were consistent with preliminary MCID analyses, which only included CGI‐TD anchors. 19, 20 PGIC anchors were added to the current analyses to address the need for more patient‐reported outcomes in TD studies. Given that patients with TD can be unaware of their movements, 21 these PGIC‐based results should be interpreted with some caution. However, consistent with the CGI‐TD results, MCID estimates based on patient‐reported improvements suggest that a 2‐ to 3‐point decrease in AIMS total score may be considered clinically meaningful. It should also be noted that both anchor‐based methods (CGI‐TD and PGIC) included placebo responders to lessen the risk of the MCID being specific to valbenazine treatment. Additional MCID analyses based on data from other TD clinical trials (e.g. deutetrabenazine) would help to further establish whether an AIMS MCID of 2 to 3 points is applicable to different TD therapies.

### Abnormal involuntary movement scale in tardive dyskinesia: minimal clinically important difference [^3438df31]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Finally, as previously published, 15 the limitations of anchor‐based methods should be mentioned. First, different anchors may result in different MCIDs, although the current analysis showed consistency between clinician‐based (CGI‐TD) and patient‐based (PGIC) anchors. Moreover, MCIDs from both anchor types were consistent with a commonly used distribution method (i.e. 0.5 times the SD). In addition, anchors can be susceptible to recall bias, and inter‐rater agreement was not tested for clinicians or study participants.

Despite these various limitations, the TD Workshop participants agreed that the AIMS MCID can be an important advancement for clinicians who treat patients with TD. Taken in conjunction with other types of analyses (e.g. placebo‐corrected mean change, effect size, treatment response, and NNT), or even added prospectively to statistical analysis plans, the MCID might help translate trial data into clinically meaningful information. Based on both clinician‐ and patient‐rated anchors, the results of this analysis suggest that a 2‐point decrease in AIMS total score may be considered an MCID if minimal improvement is the treatment goal; a 3‐point decrease may be the MCID if more robust improvement is desired. Much more research is needed to understand the impact of TD on patients and caregivers, including the benchmarks of physical, functional, and social improvements that constitute a truly meaningful clinical difference.
