## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best next management step for a 27-year-old man with severe hyperglycemia, low bicarbonate, and hyperkalemia, whose glucose and potassium have improved but bicarbonate remains low after initial treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely diagnosis and whether this is DKA or HHS. Then, I should verify the current metabolic status and whether the acidosis is resolving. Next, I will review guideline-based principles for ongoing DKA/HHS management, especially insulin, fluids, and dextrose. After that, I need to check potassium handling and whether replacement is indicated. Finally, I will evaluate the role of bicarbonate and decide among the answer choices with a clear rationale anchored to consensus guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Severe hyperglycemia with low bicarbonate and hyperkalemia strongly suggests diabetic ketoacidosis, and the improvement in glucose and potassium with initial therapy is consistent with DKA treatment response. I should double-check that the bicarbonate of 19 mEq/L still indicates ongoing metabolic acidosis, which it does, even though the glucose has normalized, because ketonemia typically lags behind glycemic correction in DKA [^6a304466] [^64da3dbb].

> Wait, let me verify the current metabolic priorities. In DKA, insulin drives glucose into cells and shifts potassium intracellularly, so hyperkalemia often improves even as total body potassium is depleted; thus, potassium can fall quickly with ongoing insulin, risking hypokalemia. The acidosis persists because ketone clearance lags, so continued insulin and dextrose are needed to clear ketones while preventing hypoglycemia, and fluids should be adjusted to maintain perfusion and electrolyte balance [^6a304466] [^64da3dbb].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning with guideline-based fluid and insulin strategy. The ADA recommends continuing intravenous insulin until ketonemia resolves, and when plasma glucose falls below about 250 mg/dL, fluids should include dextrose to permit ongoing insulin until the anion gap closes and bicarbonate normalizes. This prevents premature insulin cessation and rebound hyperglycemia, and it addresses the lag in acid-base correction seen in DKA [^64da3dbb] [^3ca299c7].

> Hold on, I should verify potassium management. Even though potassium fell from 6.3 to 4.3 mEq/L, total body potassium is likely low, and ongoing insulin will continue to shift potassium intracellularly. Guidelines advise adding potassium to IV fluids once urine output is adequate and potassium is below about 5.0–5.2 mEq/L, with frequent checks to avoid hypokalemia. Given the current 4.3 mEq/L and active insulin, potassium replacement is appropriate [^94a269bf] [^25940499].

> Let me consider the role of bicarbonate. Routine bicarbonate is not recommended in DKA because it does not improve outcomes and may cause harm, including hypokalemia and paradoxical CNS acidosis. I initially thought bicarbonate might help the persistent low bicarbonate, but wait, I should correct that — current consensus advises against routine bicarbonate unless there is life-threatening acidosis with pH less than about 6.9 or refractory shock, which is not the case here [^9f5abf56] [^c54599f2] [^dd451797].

> Next, I should review the answer choices against this framework. Option A proposes insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose, which matches the need for continued insulin with dextrose to clear ketones, potassium replacement to prevent hypokalemia, and ongoing isotonic fluids for perfusion and electrolyte delivery. Option B, fluids only, would omit insulin and risk persistent ketosis. Option C, oral rehydration, is unsafe in ongoing DKA. Option D, supportive care alone, would prematurely stop definitive therapy and risks recurrence or complications [^64da3dbb] [^6a304466].

> I should confirm the practical details. Insulin should continue as a fixed-rate infusion until resolution of ketonemia and normalization of bicarbonate, dextrose should be added to IV fluids to maintain glucose around 150–200 mg/dL while insulin continues, and potassium should be replaced in fluids with close monitoring every 2–4 hours. This approach prevents hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and incomplete resolution of acidosis [^64da3dbb] [^94a269bf].

> Final answer: A. Insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose, because continued insulin with dextrose is required to clear ketones, potassium replacement prevents hypokalemia from intracellular shifts, and isotonic fluids support perfusion and electrolyte delivery until DKA fully resolves, consistent with contemporary DKA guidelines [^64da3dbb] [^6a304466].

---

The best next step is **continued insulin with dextrose-containing fluids** [^64da3dbb] to clear ketones and correct the persistent metabolic acidosis, while monitoring potassium closely and replacing it as needed to prevent hypokalemia [^480053bc]. Bicarbonate is not indicated unless pH is < 6.9 or there is life-threatening acidosis [^9f5abf56] [^f2bc3a72]. IV fluids alone (B) are insufficient, oral rehydration (C) is unsafe in this setting, and supportive care alone (D) risks incomplete DKA resolution and recurrence [^6a304466].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical implications

The patient's initial presentation with severe hyperglycemia, low bicarbonate, and hyperkalemia is consistent with **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^6a304466]. DKA is characterized by insulin deficiency, leading to hyperglycemia, ketogenesis, and metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia in DKA is primarily due to insulin deficiency and acidosis, which shift potassium extracellularly despite total body potassium depletion [^bc44bfb4].

Following initial treatment, glucose and potassium levels have normalized, but the bicarbonate level remains low, indicating **persistent metabolic acidosis**. This is common in DKA, as insulin therapy and fluid resuscitation correct hyperglycemia and potassium shifts, but ketone clearance and bicarbonate regeneration lag behind [^64da3dbb].

---

## Rationale for continued insulin therapy

Continued insulin therapy is essential to suppress ketogenesis and promote ketone clearance, thereby correcting the metabolic acidosis [^6a304466]. Even after glucose normalization, insulin must be continued until **ketonemia resolves and bicarbonate normalizes** [^64da3dbb]. Premature discontinuation of insulin can lead to recurrence of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis [^6a304466].

---

## Role of dextrose-containing fluids

Dextrose-containing fluids are necessary to prevent hypoglycemia while continuing insulin therapy [^64da3dbb]. Once plasma glucose falls below 250 mg/dL, dextrose should be added to intravenous fluids to allow continued insulin administration until **ketonemia resolves** [^64da3dbb]. This approach ensures sustained insulin delivery and complete metabolic recovery [^64da3db7].

---

## Potassium management

Despite initial hyperkalemia, total body potassium is typically depleted in DKA due to osmotic diuresis and insulin deficiency [^3432b59c]. As insulin therapy shifts potassium intracellularly, serum potassium levels can rapidly decline, risking **hypokalemia** [^480053bc]. Therefore, potassium replacement is often necessary once urine output is established and serum potassium falls below 5.0 mEq/L [^94a269bf].

---

## Indications for bicarbonate therapy

Routine bicarbonate administration is **not recommended** in DKA, as it does not improve outcomes and may cause harm, including hypokalemia, paradoxical CNS acidosis, and delayed ketone clearance [^9f5abf56] [^dd451797]. Bicarbonate therapy is reserved for severe acidosis (pH < 6.9) or life-threatening acidosis with hemodynamic instability [^f2bc3a72].

---

## Monitoring and transition to subcutaneous insulin

Continuous monitoring of glucose, electrolytes, and acid-base status is essential during treatment [^480053bc]. Transition to subcutaneous insulin should occur only after **ketonemia resolves**, bicarbonate normalizes, and the patient is clinically stable [^c54599f2].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose | Continued insulin with dextrose-containing fluids addresses persistent acidosis; potassium replacement prevents hypokalemia | Appropriate |
| B. IV fluids only | Insufficient to clear ketones or correct acidosis | Inappropriate |
| C. Oral rehydration | Unsafe in ongoing DKA due to risk of aspiration and inadequate absorption | Inappropriate |
| D. Supportive therapy and close monitoring | Risks incomplete DKA resolution and recurrence | Inappropriate |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best next step is to **continue insulin with dextrose-containing fluids**, monitor potassium closely, and replace it as needed. This approach ensures complete resolution of ketoacidosis while preventing hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Bicarbonate therapy is not indicated unless there is severe acidosis or hemodynamic instability [^9f5abf56].

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^dd451797]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^756a915c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

We report a unique case of diabetic ketoacidosis in which a relatively low potassium level on admission was associated with consequent life-threatening and refractory arrhythmia secondary to inappropriate use of intravenous insulin and bicarbonate therapy. The latter was reversed by rapid bolus potassium injection. Although we do not advocate this approach in every case, we emphasise that a bolus injection of potassium may be life saving in such cases. The lessons from this case have led to multidisciplinary meetings and modification of the institute's diabetic ketoacidosis clinical pathway.

Hyperkalemia severity — suggested action for moderate and severe elevations is stratified by thresholds and clinical context. Moderate hyperkalemia (K+ 6.0–6.4 mmol/l) warrants, if clinically unwell or acute kidney injury (AKI), to assess and treat in hospital, and if an unexpected result, to repeat within 24 hours. Severe hyperkalemia (K+ ≥ 6.5 mmol/l) warrants to take immediate action to assess and treat, with assessment to include blood testing and electrocardiogram monitoring.

4.5 Potassium replacement

Hypokalaemia in HHS is multifactorial. Osmotic diuresis and consequent hypertonicity from hyperglycaemia lead to fluids shifts from the intracellular space into the extracellular space. This leads to intracellular potassium loss. In addition, hypoperfusion leads to the activation of aldosterone secretion, further exacerbating the potassium loss. Vomiting, if present, worsens hypokalaemia. Lack of insulin in DKA, accumulation of ketone bodies leading to ketoacidosis and drop in bicarbonate ion concentration leads to a further loss of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space. In both cases (DKA and/or HHS) there is a total body loss of potassium. Treatment with insulin will lead to a shift of potassium back into the intracellular space which unravels hypokalaemia.

Those on diuretics may be profoundly hypokalaemic to start with. It is also worth noting that if acute kidney injury is present, hyperkalaemia may be present owing to reduced clearance and therefore closer monitoring is required.

Potassium level assessment and replacement is crucial in management of HHS and if mixed with ketosis/DKA. For guidance on potassium replacement see Table 2.

Hyperkalemia contributors and diet strategies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — non-dietary factors and when diet restriction applies are outlined. Medications, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmosis due to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia or uremia, and constipation are more likely to explain plasma potassium abnormalities than diet. Although short-term dietary restriction of the foods highest in potassium is a valid strategy to treat acute hyperkalemia, restriction of foods highest in bioavailable potassium may be a supportive prevention strategy for people with a history of hyperkalemia or during periods in which hyperkalemia risk is a concern.

### Profound hypokalemia associated with severe diabetic ketoacidosis [^3fa747aa]. Pediatric Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, severe hypokalemia at presentation prior to insulin treatment is exceedingly uncommon. A previously healthy 8-yr-old female presented with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe DKA (pH = 6.98), and profound hypokalemia (serum K = 1.3 mmol/L) accompanied by cardiac dysrhythmia. Insulin therapy was delayed for 9 h to allow replenishment of potassium to safe serum levels. Meticulous intensive care management resulted in complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of measuring serum potassium levels prior to initiating insulin therapy in DKA, judicious fluid and electrolyte management, as well as delaying and/or reducing insulin infusion rates in the setting of severe hypokalemia.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^6a304466]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

### Approach to the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^94182727]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of severe metabolic acidosis, remains a life-threatening condition due to complications of both the disease and its treatment. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case discusses DKA management, emphasizing complications of treatment. Because cerebral edema is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in children with DKA, we emphasize its pathophysiology and implications for therapy. The risk for cerebral edema may be minimized by avoiding a bolus of insulin, excessive saline resuscitation, and a decrease in effective plasma osmolality early in treatment. A goal of fluid therapy is to lower muscle venous Pco 2 to ensure effective removal of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate buffer in muscle and diminish the binding of hydrogen ions to intracellular proteins in vital organs (such as the brain). In patients with DKA and a relatively low plasma potassium level, insulin administration may cause hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. It is suggested in these cases to temporarily delay insulin administration and first administer potassium chloride intravenously to bring the plasma potassium level close to 4mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate administration in adult patients should be individualized. We suggest it be considered in a subset of patients with moderately severe acidemia (pH < 7.20 and plasma bicarbonate level < 12mmol/L) who are at risk for worsening acidemia, particularly if hemodynamically unstable. Sodium bicarbonate should not be administered to children with DKA, except if acidemia is very severe and hemodynamic instability is refractory to saline administration.

### Real world evidence for treatment of hyperkalemia in the emergency department (REVEAL-ED): a multicenter, prospective, observational study [^8d9beb4f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary emergency department (ED) standard-of-care treatment of hyperkalemia is poorly described.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the treatment patterns of hyperkalemia management in the ED.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluated patients aged ≥ 18 years with hyperkalemia (potassium [K +] level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the ED from October 25, 2015 to March 30, 2016. K + -lowering therapies and K + were documented at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after initial ED treatment. The primary end point was change in K + over 4 h.

Results

Overall, 203 patients were enrolled at 14 U.S.-based sites. The initial median K + was 6.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.7–6.8) mmol/L and median time to treatment was 2.7 (IQR 1.9–3.5) h post-ED arrival. Insulin/glucose (n = 130; 64%) was frequently used to treat hyperkalemia; overall, 43 different treatment combinations were employed within the first 4 h. Within 4 h, the median K + for patients treated with medications alone decreased from 6.3 (IQR, 5.8–6.8) mmol/L to 5.3 (4.8–5.7) mmol/L, while that for patients treated with dialysis decreased from 6.2 (IQR 6.0–6.6) mmol/L to 3.8 (IQR 3.6–4.2) mmol/L. Hypoglycemia occurred in 6% of patients overall and in 17% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L. Hyperkalemia-related electrocardiogram changes were observed in 23% of all patients; 45% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L had peaked T waves or widened QRS. Overall, 79% were hospitalized; 3 patients died.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia practice patterns vary considerably and, although treatment effectively lowered K +, only dialysis normalized median K + within 4 h.

### Euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes on empagliflozin [^d624a9af]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are glucose-lowering drugs with proven efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, and more recently, have been shown to improve heart failure outcomes in patients without diabetes. A rare complication of SGLT2 inhibitor use is the development of euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), characterised by euglycaemia (blood glucose level < 250mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (arterial pH < 7.3and serum bicarbonate < 18mEq/L), and ketonaemia. Given patients with EDKA do not present with the typical manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis, including marked hyperglycaemia and dehydration, the diagnosis of EDKA may be missed and initiation of treatment delayed. We present the case of a man with recent SGLT2 inhibitor use and multiple other risk factors who developed EDKA.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^c54599f2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

Management of cardiac arrest due to severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) using bicarbonate therapy and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) remains controversial. We report a case of a 24-year-old man with insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus who survived without any neurologic complications after prolonged ECLS (including fluid resuscitation and insulin but no aggressive bicarbonate) for cardiac arrest due to severe DKA. In post-DKA cardiac arrest, insulin and fluid resuscitation is the mainstay of treatment, but ECLS should be considered when prolonged cardiac arrest is expected.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^e0906d94]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with DKA and HHS on admission and was triaged into the ICU and started on IV fluids, IV bicarbonate, and IV insulin drip, in accordance with diabetes crisis management guidelines. Of note, the patient also presented with severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes. Hyperkalemia is a common finding in DKA, and is secondary to hypoinsulinemia and renal dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury in this case); the hyperkalemia is not due to the previously held opinion that metabolic acidosis causes the exchange of hydrogen ions for potassium ions across cell membranes. The severe anion gap acidosis was corrected by the second day of admission with repeat ABG showing pH 7.42, pCO 2 31 mmHg, pO 2 116%, HCO 3 − 20.1 mmol/L, SaO 2 99%, BMP: sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, anion gap 19 mmol/L, BUN 24 mg/dL, creatinine 0.77 mg/dL, glucose 366 mg/dL, repeat ECG showed normalized T waves.

The patient also presented with abdominal pain on admission. Initially, this pain was diagnosed as DKA-associated abdominal pain. However, she had persistent abdominal pain despite the closure of the anion gap and correction of DKA and HHS. Additional laboratory tests revealed lipase 720 U/L and amylase 225 U/L, suggesting acute pancreatitis. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast found mild–moderate right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter down to the level of a 6-mm stone in the proximal-mid right ureter without significant pancreatic changes. MRCP showed no biliary or pancreatic duct dilation. Current diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis require two out of three of the following criteria: (1) acute abdominal pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen; (2) elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood or urine; (3) abnormal finding of acute pancreatitis detected by ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Of note, imaging studies are not 100% sensitive and in mild episodes of acute pancreatitis, CT features can range from normal-appearing pancreas to diffuse enlargement and heterogeneous attenuation of the gland. Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, although the etiology was initially unknown.

### Profound hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: a therapeutic challenge [^20410e79]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe profound hypokalemia in a comatose patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

We present a case report, review the mechanisms for the occurrence of hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis, and discuss its management in the setting of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality.

Results

A 22-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted in a comatose state. Laboratory tests revealed a blood glucose level of 747 mg/dL, serum potassium of 1.9 mEq/L, pH of 6.8, and calculated effective serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg. She was intubated and resuscitated with intravenously administered fluids. Intravenous administration of vasopressors was necessary for stabilization of the blood pressure. Intravenous infusion of insulin was initiated to control the hyperglycemia, and repletion of total body potassium stores was undertaken. A total of 660 mEq of potassium was administered intravenously during the first 12.5 hours. Despite such aggressive initial repletion of potassium, the patient required 40 to 80 mEq of potassium daily for the next 8 days to increase the serum potassium concentration to normal.

Conclusion

Profound hypokalemia, an uncommon initial manifestation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, is indicative of severe total body potassium deficiency. Under such circumstances, aggressive potassium repletion in a comatose patient must be undertaken during correction of other metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. Intravenously administered insulin should be withheld until the serum potassium concentration is (3)3.3 mEq/L.

### Metabolic acidosis [^afff4465]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^f2bc3a72]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of euDKA are not available. Relevant recommendations for the treatment of DKA suggest volume restoration with isotonic fluid of NaCl 0,9%, ensuring that serum K is > 3.3 mmol/l before initiation of insulin therapy, while bicarbonate infusion should only be considered in cases of life-threatening acidosis (PH < 6.9). However, recognition of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved, enables successful treatment with simple measures. In our case in particular, infusion of a minimum amount of bicarbonate, along with proper insulin administration was sufficient to restore the HCO 3 − deficit and to raise the pH into safe levels. Resolution of vomiting and proper feeding along with insulin administration and SGLT-2 inhibitor withdrawal completely reversed the abnormal metabolic process. In less than 24 h the patient had restored normal blood pH and was switched to subcutaneous insulin regiment.

Overall, euDKA associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor use in T2DM is a serious side-effect, often with a multifactorial etiology. Increased awareness and recognition of involved factors can safely restore normal acid-base balance with simple measures. Given the undisputed cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and their awaited increased use, physicians need to familiarize themselves with euDKA and its treatment in order to readily manage this complication for the benefit of our patients.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^a6d4cb6a]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Beating the odds – surviving extreme hyperkalemia [^3943d88b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Severe hyperkalemia (> 7 mmol/L) is a medical emergency because of possible fatal arrhythmias. We here report the case of a 58-year-old woman surviving extreme hyperkalemia (> 10 mmol/L). The patient with a history of congestive heart failure, a DDD pacemaker and mild chronic renal insufficiency was admitted with progressive weakness and sudden onset of hypotension and bradycardia in the absence of any pacemaker action. Laboratory tests revealed an extreme serum potassium level of 10.1 mmol/L, with a slightly elevated serum creatinine of 149 μmol/L. Treatment with norepinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin improved both the hemodynamic situation and the serum potassium with subsequent regaining pacemaker actions even before additional hemodialysis normalized the potassium level. A thorough investigation demonstrated that several mechanisms contributed to the extreme potassium level: urinalysis and a low transtubular potassium gradient in the presence of metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap pointed to preexisting interstitial nephritis, with renal tubular acidosis type IV as the predisposing factor, whereas several drugs and acute impairment of renal function contributed to the dangerous situation. Despite the odds for fatal outcome, the patient recovered completely, and long-term management was initiated to prevent recurrent hyperkalemia.

### Excessive sodium bicarbonate infusion may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^41044776]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old male with a history of post-surgical repair for ventricular septal defect (VSD) contacted the emergency department of a branch hospital of Changhua Christian Hospital because of dyspnea and altered consciousness for 3 days. Symptoms of poor response to stimulations and lethargy occurred gradually. No medications or street drugs were administered. Upon arrival, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was reported as E2M4V3; furthermore, hypotension (80/39 mmHg) and hypothermia (34.5 °C) were noted. Laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis (15,000/μl), severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.04, PCO 2: 11.2 mmHg, HCO 3 −: 3.1 mmol/l), hypokalemia (2.0 mmol/l), and hyperglycemia (646 mg/dl). Serum sodium level was 138 mmol/l unadjusted and 148 mmol/l after adjustment according to the formula of an increase of 1.6 mmol/l per 100 mg/dl of serum glucose.

Initially, four ampules of sodium bicarbonate (7%, 20 mL each ampule) and one ampule of potassium chloride (20 meq) were administered. The patient was admitted to the ICU because of unstable hemodynamics. Insulin was continuously infused, and intubation was performed because of persistent hypotension and altered consciousness. Large amounts of isotonic and hypertonic intravenous fluids were administered for resuscitation (2500 mL 0.9% normal saline, 2000 mL 6% hydroxyethyl starch fluid, and 4000 mL Ringer's solution for 24-h duration). In addition, norepinephrine and epinephrine were continuously infused. Severe hypokalemia was reported, and multiple ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) were witnessed. In total, 440 meq of potassium chloride was administered. Notably, his consciousness status (GCS: E3M6Ve) and hemodynamics improved following the resuscitation. Sequential blood sampling results are presented in Fig. 1.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^bd1d86e4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^48fd8fe1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Intravenous solutions in the care of patients with volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities [^50bc95cd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^ead6658b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^b010e89d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

This includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose". In patients "with moderate to high risk of RS with low electrolyte levels, holding the initiation or increase of calories until electrolytes are supplemented and/or normalized should be considered", and "Initiation of or increasing calories should be delayed in patients with severely low phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium levels until corrected". It adds that "Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused in dextrose should be considered in the limits above and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk for RS", and if a patient has had "significant amounts of dextrose for several days" with stable electrolytes, "calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than recommended above".

### Regular performance feedback may be key to maintain good quality DKA management: results from a five-year study [^d3717cb2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

While the DKA duration is important, complications such as hypokalemia and hypoglycemia resulting from the management of DKA could be life threatening. The initial hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis result in a relatively higher serum osmolarity, which then induces osmotic diuresis and renal electrolyte loss, potassium being the most significant. Vomiting, a commonly associated symptom in DKA, results in further potassium loss. With treatment initiation and insulin infusion, there is a shift of potassium from serum into cells further exaggerating the hypokalemia. Several cases of profound hypokalemia leading to cardiac dysrhythmias have been reported in the past. Hypoglycemia is the most frequent complication with DKA treatment arising secondary to the discrepancy between the availability of glucose to insulin that that needs to switch off lipolysis. Lately, there is an increased frequency of euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Such patients with SGLT2 inhibitor associated euglycaemic ketoacidosis are more susceptible to hypoglycemia with DKA treatment further to a complex drug-associated mechanism. However, there is limited literature studying the prevalence and associated risk factors of hypoglycemia resulting from DKA treatment.

Regrettably, we did not measure these complications in this study. Therefore, we cannot ascertain if our intervention made any difference to these complication rates. Moreover, we were not able to assess if a shorter duration of DKA influences readmission rates. We are currently in the process of updating our DKA monitoring system to include monitoring for hypokalemia and hypoglycemia alongside the time of administration of basal insulin during each episode. Frequencies of recurrent DKA admission and its causal factors have been proposed as further parameters that warrant monitoring. We excluded patients who were managed in intensive care as the benefit of continuous monitoring and one-to-one nursing could impact patients' management. Further research is needed to study the specifics (impact of timing, dose and administration of long-acting insulin) on DKA duration and the global management of DKA.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^04714d0c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO AKI — potassium and metabolic acidosis considerations explain that when therapeutic measures that promote the intracellular shift of potassium are exhausted, an excess of potassium can only be eliminated with RRT, and using intermittent dialysis after such measures reduces extracorporeal potassium removal with a more pronounced post‑treatment rebound. For acidosis, metabolic acidosis associated with AKI can usually be corrected with bicarbonate and should rarely require urgent dialysis if not accompanied by volume overload or uremia; because pH and bicarbonate values to initiate dialysis are not supported by evidence, no standard criteria for initiating dialysis for acidosis exist, while some poisonings can contribute to acid‑base problems and RRT may facilitate removal of the offending drug.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^fda39cfa]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Both BSPED and NICE recommend the following fluid maintenance requirements, using 0.9% sodium chloride without added glucose, and the Holliday-Segar formula:

100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg (0–10 kg body weight).
50 mL/kg for the second 10 kg (10–20 kg body weight).
20 mL/kg for each subsequent kilogramme (> 20 kg body weight).
When calculating the total fluid replacement, subtract any initial bolus volumes from the total fluid deficit (unless the child or young person is in shock).

For insulin and electrolyte replacement requirements, both recommend:

The addition of 40 mmol/L potassium chloride to all fluids (apart from the initial intravenous bolus) unless the patient is anuric or hyperkalaemic. Include this before starting the insulin infusion if hypokalaemia is observed at presentation.
0.9% sodium chloride should be used without added glucose unless the plasma glucose is < 14 mmol/L.
Initially assess for the presence of hyponatraemia, continue to monitor throughout treatment and treat as soon as blood glucose falls. Monitor sodium levels throughout treatment and calculate sodium initially to identify if hyponatraemia is present. This should be treated as soon as blood glucose falls. It is important to monitor as hyponatraemia and rapidly increasing sodium levels can both be signs of CO.
Do not give intravenous sodium bicarbonate to CYP with DKA unless they have compromised cardiac contractility caused by life-threatening hyperkalaemia or severe acidosis, and you have discussed with paediatric intensivist.
A soluble insulin infusion of between 0.05 units/kg/hour and 0.1 units/kg/hour, 1–2 hours after intravenous fluids have been commenced. BSPED stated that the 0.05 units/kg/hour should be sufficient unless the patient is suffering from severe DKA or is an adolescent. If they are attached to a 'continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion', disconnect when starting intravenous insulin therapy. For patients already on long-acting insulin, it may be continued, and in new patients consider commencing long-acting subcutaneous insulin alongside intravenous. Similarly, the NICE guidelines state that continuing subcutaneous basal insulin in a child or young person who was using a basal insulin before DKA may be continued in discussion with a diabetes specialist.

### Challenging management dogma where evidence is non-existent, weak, or outdated: part II [^aaa9667f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Many dogmas influence daily clinical practice, and critical care medicine is no exception. We previously highlighted the weak, questionable, and often contrary evidence base underpinning four established medical managements-loop diuretics for acute heart failure, routine use of heparin thromboprophylaxis, rate of sodium correction for hyponatremia, and 'every hour counts' for treating bacterial meningitis. We now provide four further examples in this "Dogma II" piece (a week's course of antibiotics, diabetic ketoacidosis algorithms, sodium bicarbonate to improve ventricular contractility during severe metabolic acidosis, and phosphate replacement for hypophosphatemia) where routine practice warrants re-appraisal.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^532ec9c0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^c5b09699]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^dba3ff1f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

2 CURRENT APPROACHES TO THE PREVENTION, RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and to proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and thirst occur late, and hyperglycaemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Current available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^849afaa1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^68da76b3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that presents commonly to the emergency department. Severe DKA has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on the emergency clinician to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.

Discussion

DKA is a condition found most commonly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent the complications that can occur.

Conclusions

DKA is a medical condition that has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^7159fac3]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA is the result of absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in combination with exuberant secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone) resulting in blockade of glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, fat, muscle) and a cascade of derangement progressing to ketoacidosis and dehydration. Much new-onset DKA can be prevented by increased awareness of early signs and symptoms of diabetes and, in principle, almost all recurrent DKA is preventable by informed sick day management, recognition of psychosocial problems leading to insulin omission, and careful monitoring of insulin pump function.

Management of DKA should occur in centers with treatment experience and monitoring capability. Fluid replacement begins with 0.9% saline to restore circulation and subsequent 0.45% saline for maintenance and replacement of 5%–10% dehydration, according to severity indicators. Whether levels of serum K are normal or elevated, there will be a total K deficit that must be dealt with early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is neither necessary nor safe. Mannitol or hypertonic saline should be at the bedside, for rapid intervention as indicated for CE, the most common serious complication of DKA. Other complications include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoglycemia, intracerebral complications other than CE, peripheral venous thrombosis, mucormycosis, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. Among questions that need to be addressed regarding DKA in children and adolescents are whether feasible and cost-effective methods can reduce the frequency of new-onset and recurrent DKA, what characterizes optimal fluid replacement therapy, how effective proposed monitoring and intervention criteria are in the reduction of CE morbidity and mortality, and whether hypertonic saline is as or more effective than mannitol in the treatment of CE.

Key points

Treatment of DKA requires first and foremost fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, followed by replacement for 5%–10% dehydration, depending on severity, and maintenance with 0.45% saline, and early and adequate K replacement.
Insulin should not be given as a bolus, but infused after the initial fluid resuscitation in a dose of 0.1 U/kg of body weight/hour.
Bicarbonate infusion is contraindicated in pediatric DKA.
CE is the most common serious complication, requiring careful neurologic and vital sign monitoring and early intervention with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion.

### Disorders of sodium [^5561e26a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain is if the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on severity of symptoms with the most rapid treatment occurring in only the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion in order to prevent these devastating consequences.

### Potassium disorders – clinical spectrum and emergency management [^54c698e5]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are common and may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias or cardiopulmonary arrest. They are an anticipated complication in patients with renal failure, but may also occur in patients with no previous history of renal disease. They have a broad clinical spectrum of presentation and this paper will highlight the life-threatening arrhythmias associated with both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. Although the medical literature to date has provided a foundation for the therapeutic options available, this has not translated into consistent medical practice. Treatment algorithms have undoubtedly been useful in the management of other medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest and acute asthma. Hence, we have applied this strategy to the treatment of hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia which may prove valuable in clinical practice.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^07012828]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in the rational use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^64da3dbb]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to modify replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L) to contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to the 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis (usually within 4–8 hours).

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^3a0e9c42]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

BALANCED CRYSTALLOIDS AND SERUM POTASSIUM CONCENTRATION

As balanced crystalloids contain potassium, they were traditionally considered to be contraindicated in the presence of hyperkalemia or situations with a potential for hyperkalemia, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or rhabdomyolysis. However, the maximum concentration of potassium in balanced crystalloids is 5 mmol/l, which gets rapidly diluted in extracellular fluid after infusion. This is unlikely to cause an appreciable increase in serum potassium concentrations and four recent small-scale studies have reinforced this view.,

A single-blind study randomized patients with rhabdomyolysis (creatinine kinase > 1000 IU/l) secondary to doxylamine intoxication to receive infusions of either 0.9% saline (n = 15) or RL (n = 13) at rates of 400 ml/h. Median urinary (4.25 vs. 5.5) and serum pH (7.44 vs. 7.36) were significantly higher in the RL group than in patients who received saline. There were no significant differences in serum potassium concentrations, but patients in the saline group had higher serum sodium and chloride concentrations. Median time to creatinine kinase normalization (< 200 IU/l) was 96 h in the RL group compared with 120 h in the saline group, and it was found that patients in the RL group did not develop metabolic acidosis and needed little supplemental sodium bicarbonate.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^1975430a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: the paradox of delayed correction of acidosis [^490cc140]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effectiveness of standard treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in "euglycemic DKA" (EuDKA, blood glucose (BG) ≤ 250 mg/dL) was evaluated with respect to the time to correction of BG ≤ 200 mg/dL, anion gap (AG) ≤ 12 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate [HCO3] ≥ 18 mmol/L.

Methods

Data were retrieved from an electronic health record (EPIC) for "diabetic ketoacidosis". Patients were categorized by initial BG as EuDKA, middle range DKA (MrDKA, > 250 < 600 mg/dL) and hyperosmolar DKA (HyperDKA ≥ 600 mg/dL).

Results

There were 56 patients (27men, 29women; age 45.8 ± 15.6 (SD) years. The initial 8-h insulin infusion rate (0.05 ± 0.02, 0.09 ± 0.03, 0.14 ± 0.05units/kg/h, p < 0.001) and the time to correction of BG (3.4 ± 1.9, 6.1 ± 2.9 and 9.6 ± 3.9 h, p < 0.001), differed for EuDKA, MrDKA and HyperDKA. There were no differences in the time to correction of AG or [HCO3]. The earlier time to correction of BG in EuDKA resulted in paradoxical longer lag times for correction of [HCO3] (p = 0.003) and AG (p = 0.048). Changes in BG, AG and [HCO3] correlated with insulin infusion rates of 0.08–0.1units/kg/h whereas in EuDKA the insulin infusion rate was 0.05 ± 0.02 units/kg/h.

Conclusion

In EuDKA, correlation analyses suggest that higher glucose and insulin infusion rates than what would be projected for the level of blood glucose are required to reverse ketoacidosis. Prospective trials are required to optimize the levels of glucose and insulin infusions in EuDKA.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^25483cb0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

Methods

Study design, setting and population

The study was undertaken at a large tertiary care center in West Midlands, UK, which serves an ethnically diverse population of over one million people. All people admitted with DKA from April 2014 to September 2020 were included in the study. DKA was defined as blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, pH ≤ 7.3 or bicarbonate ≤ 15 mmol/L and ketonemia ≥ 3 mmol/L. The list of people admitted with DKA was initially screened based on those who meet one of the following criteria: electronic records with pH < 7.3 and blood glucose > 11 mmol/L or referral with DKA to the specialist team or discharged with a diagnosis of DKA. This list was further manually verified for confirmed diagnosis of DKA and only those who met the criteria as per national guidelines were included in the study. Classification (type 1/2) of diabetes was based on a clinical diagnosis as per National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, although may have been confirmed through islet autoantibody or C peptide testing. Patients who had DKA were identified using an automatic monitoring system, and data regarding various aspects of DKA were collected manually. We reviewed patients' health records to confirm the type of diabetes diagnosis. Patients were excluded from analysis if the diabetes classification was unclear or if this information was unavailable.

DKA management guidelines

The guidelines for management of DKA at our center are based on the Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines and are the same for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment of DKA includes administering fluids to correct the deficit and replacement glucose infusion when serum glucose drops less than 14 mmol/L but ketosis persists. A fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion was administered based on the patient's body weight at a rate of 0.1 unit/kg/hour to switch of lipolysis. Hourly glucose and ketone measurements are done to check treatment progress. Venous blood gases are done during infusion bag change to ensure the next bag of fluid has appropriate potassium replacement. While the guidelines for DKA management have evolved to ensure simplicity and end-user satisfaction over the last 7 years in our institute, the principles have not changed (figure 1).

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^81843e62]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

DKA is a severe metabolic derangement characterized by dehydration, loss of electrolytes, hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, acidosis and progressive loss of consciousness that results from severe insulin deficiency combined with the effects of increased levels of counterregulatory hormones (catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone). The biochemical criteria for diagnosis are: blood glucose > 200 mg/dl, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, ketonemia > 3 mmol/L and presence of ketonuria. A patient with DKA must be managed in an emergency ward by an experienced staff or in an intensive care unit (ICU), in order to provide an intensive monitoring of the vital and neurological signs, and of the patient's clinical and biochemical response to treatment. DKA treatment guidelines include: restoration of circulating volume and electrolyte replacement; correction of insulin deficiency aiming at the resolution of metabolic acidosis and ketosis; reduction of risk of cerebral edema; avoidance of other complications of therapy (hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic acidosis); identification and treatment of precipitating events. In Brazil, there are few pediatric ICU beds in public hospitals, so an alternative protocol was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous infusion lines in order to facilitate DKA management in general emergency wards. The main differences between this protocol and the international guidelines are: intravenous fluid will be stopped when oral fluids are well tolerated and total deficit will be replaced orally; if potassium analysis still indicate need for replacement, it will be given orally; subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analog is administered at 0.15 U/kg dose every 2–3 hours until resolution of metabolic acidosis; approximately 12 hours after treatment initiation, intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is initiated at the dose of 0.6–1 U/kg/day, and it will be lowered to 0.4–0.7 U/kg/day at discharge from hospital.

### Potassium chloride and dextrose monohydrate (potassium chloride in dextrose) [^2e883d21]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [see Contraindications (4)]. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.2 Hyperkalemia

Potassium-containing solutions, including Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic and manifest only by increased serum potassium concentrations and/or characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. Cardiac arrhythmias, some fatal, can develop at any time during hyperkalemia.

To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia, do not administer Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection as an intravenous push (i.e., intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access, without quantitative infusion device [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias include those:

with severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, and certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block (especially if they receive digoxin).
with hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergoing correction of alkalosis (conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space).
treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Avoid use of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection in patients with, or at risk for, hyperkalemia. If use cannot be avoided, use a product with a low amount of potassium chloride, infuse slowly and monitor serum potassium concentrations and ECGs.

5.3 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^24e3ff16]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Treatment

Treatment for EDKA parallels that of DKA except that the risk of relapse into DKA is high in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor use (figure 2). Insulin should be delivered at a fixed rate of intravenous infusion until the anion gap corrects and the patient can transition to oral intake. For patients with insulin resistance (ie, body mass index > 35 kg/m 2), insulin infusion at a fixed rate of 2–3 units/hour is often necessary to correct the acidosis. Dextrose infusion, preferably 10% dextrose water (D10W) is typically necessary in EDKA to prevent hypoglycemia (author experience). DKA is considered resolved when the patient can eat, pH is > 7.3 units, bicarbonate is > 15.0 mmol/L, and serum ketones are < 0.6 mmol/L, and we recommend the same criteria for resolution of EDKA. Subcutaneous basal insulin should be initiated 2–3 hours before stopping the intravenous insulin infusion. The dose of basal insulin can be based on the patient's body weight (ie, 0.3 units per kilogram per day in both T1DM and T2DM) or based on the rate of intravenous insulin required in the last 6–8 hours before switching to subcutaneous insulin. If the two calculations are discrepant, we suggest the clinician use their best judgment or split the difference between the two calculations. Prandial insulin should be added when the patient starts eating, with the dose calculated as 0.1 units/kg for each meal (for both T1DM and T2DM). Doses of basal and prandial insulin will be adjusted depending on BG levels in subsequent hours and days.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

Another rising problem might be the concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine that, even it is controversial, sometimes is used for preventing the effect of the "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2). Hydroxychloroquine has a proven hypoglycemic effect, therefore also in this case the insulin treatment must be very carefully managed in order to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia. Intriguingly, there is also evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with Tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Increased attention is needed regarding the proper hydration of the diabetic patient with COVID-19 in the ICU. Hyperhydration can induce the onset of life-threatening pulmonary oedema due to the severity of lung damage during corona infection. Serum K levels are equally important, with a major risk of hypokalaemia, frequently associated with COVID-19, possibly due to hyperaldosteronism caused by elevated angiotensin 2. Insulin treatment may worsen hypokalaemia if not corrected in time.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state… [^25940499]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening endocrine emergency that most commonly affects adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Treatment Treatment of HHS requires a four-pronged approach: vigorous intravenous rehydration, electrolyte management, intravenous insulin, and diagnosis and management of precipitating and coexisting problems. 49 Figure 2 outlines the American Diabetes Association's algorithm for managing DKA and HHS in adults. 51 Patients require intensive care if they have cardiovascular instability, cannot maintain an airway, are obtunded, report acute abdominal symptoms, or cannot be monitored adequately on the general medical ward. 52 Management of HHS in children is similar to that in adults.
44. 28, 50 At least one-half of the calculated deficit should be given in the first 18 to 24 hours, with the remainder given over the next 24 hours.

Fluid administration alone will cause the plasma glucose level to decrease without insulin administration, a sign of adequate fluid replacement. 19 A plasma glucose level that does not decrease by 75 to 100 mg per dL per hour implies inadequate fluid volume or renal impairment.
19. ELECTROLYTE MANAGEMENT Total body potassium depletion is often unrecognized because the initial potassium level may be normal or high. 19, 28 However, it may plummet when insulin is administered because insulin forces potassium into cells. Therefore, once urine output is established, potassium replacement should begin. Electrolytes should be checked every one to two hours until stable, and the cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously. If the patient's initial serum potassium level is less than 3. 3 mEq per L, insulin should be held and saline and potassium chloride given until the potassium level reaches at least
3. 3 mEq per L.

If the serum potassium level is greater than 5. 2 mEq per L, potassium should be held until the level falls below
5. 2 mEq per L, with monitoring every two hours. If the initial serum potassium level is 3. 3 to
5. 2 mEq per L, 20 to 30 mEq of potassium chloride should be added to each liter of intravenous fluid to maintain the level between 4. 0 and
5. 0 mEq per L.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^271c53f3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical hyperglycemia — prehospital management directs providers to provide volume expansion with normal saline bolus; adult dosing is normal saline 20 mL/kg at rate of 1000 mL/hr, and pediatric dosing is normal saline 10 mL/kg bolus IV, reassess, and repeat up to 40 mL/kg total; if symptoms of hypovolemic shock, follow Shock Guideline. If findings of hyperkalemia are present, administer IV fluids and consider administration of calcium chloride 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes (do not exceed 1 mL per minute) OR calcium gluconate 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring. If findings of hyperkalemia, consider administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes and consider albuterol 5 mg via nebulizer (can be repeated if no response is seen). Reassess patient status, including vital signs, mental status, and signs of dehydration, and if mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate treatment if hypoglycemia has developed. Disposition guidance is to transport to closest appropriate receiving facility. Patient safety notes state that overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia, and that cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults; closely monitor for signs of altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure, immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop; asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients.

KDIGO 2024 — Evidence base for treating metabolic acidosis in CKD: The Work Group has not provided a graded recommendation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justified because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-benefit adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. A 2021 systematic review identified 15 trials with ≥ 3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no study medication; of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 11 were published since 2012, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important modifying effect on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).
