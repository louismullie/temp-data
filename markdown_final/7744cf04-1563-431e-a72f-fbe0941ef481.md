In human DNA, which nucleotide base is methylated at the 5' position?

Answer Choices:
A. Adenosine
B. Thymine
C. Cytosine
D. Guanine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which nucleotide base in human DNA is methylated at the 5' position. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chemical meaning of "5' position" in the context of a nucleotide base. Then, I should verify which base in DNA actually undergoes methylation at that position. Next, I will check whether any of the other options (adenine, thymine, guanine) are ever methylated in this way in human DNA. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note the biological significance to ensure completeness.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. In nucleic acid chemistry, "5' position" typically refers to the 5' carbon of the deoxyribose sugar in a nucleotide, but wait, let me verify whether the question is actually asking about methylation on the base itself rather than the sugar. The phrase "methylated at the 5' position" in epigenetics almost always refers to the 5-carbon of the cytosine base ring, forming 5-methylcytosine, not methylation of the 5' sugar phosphate position, so I should keep the base context front and center.

> Now, I need to check which base is modified. Multiple authoritative sources consistently state that DNA methylation in mammals occurs when a methyl group is added to the 5-carbon of the cytosine ring, producing 5-methylcytosine, especially in CpG dinucleotides, which is the canonical epigenetic mark in human DNA.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other options. I should confirm whether adenine, thymine, or guanine are ever methylated at a 5' position in human DNA. Adenine can be methylated at the N6 position in certain contexts, but that is not a 5' carbon modification and is not the standard human DNA methylation mark, thymine already has a methyl group at the 5-carbon of its base ring and is not further methylated at that position in human DNA, and guanine is not methylated at a 5' position in human DNA, so these do not fit the question's wording or the canonical biology.

> I should double-check the exact phrasing of the question to ensure I'm not missing a trick. The question asks which base is methylated at the 5' position in human DNA; given that thymine already contains a methyl at C5, it cannot be "methylated at the 5' position" in the same sense as cytosine, and the well-established human DNA methylation is 5-methylcytosine, so the correct answer is cytosine.

> Final answer: C. Cytosine.

---

The correct answer is **Cytosine**. In human DNA, methylation occurs at the **5-carbon position of cytosine**, forming 5-methylcytosine, primarily in CpG dinucleotides. This modification is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) and is a key epigenetic mark regulating gene expression, chromatin structure, and genomic imprinting. Adenine, thymine, and guanine are not methylated at the 5' position in human DNA.

## Chemical structure and methylation of cytosine

Cytosine is a **pyrimidine base** with a five-membered ring that includes a carbon at position 5. Methylation at this position forms **5-methylcytosine (5mC)** [^116XEMnt], a stable modification that persists through DNA replication and cell division [^112oZuDs]. The methyl group is donated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) [^116XEMnt], and the reaction is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) [^112oZuDs].

---

## Enzymes responsible for cytosine methylation

Three **DNA methyltransferases** are responsible for cytosine methylation in humans:

- **DNMT1**: Maintains methylation patterns during DNA replication, ensuring faithful transmission of methylation marks to daughter cells [^112oZuDs].
- **DNMT3A and DNMT3B**: Responsible for de novo methylation, establishing new methylation patterns during development and differentiation [^112oZuDs].

---

## Biological significance of cytosine methylation

Cytosine methylation has **profound biological effects**, including:

- **Gene expression regulation**: Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions typically silences gene expression by preventing transcription factor binding and recruiting proteins that compact chromatin [^1148kbog].
- **Chromatin structure modulation**: Methylation influences chromatin architecture, promoting a condensed, transcriptionally inactive state [^112oZuDs].
- **Genomic imprinting**: Methylation marks distinguish maternal and paternal alleles, ensuring parent-of-origin-specific gene expression [^112oZuDs].
- **X-chromosome inactivation**: Methylation is essential for silencing one of the female X chromosomes, balancing gene dosage between sexes [^112oZuDs].

---

## Distribution of cytosine methylation in the human genome

Cytosine methylation is **non-uniformly distributed** across the genome. CpG islands — CpG-rich regions often found in gene promoters — are typically unmethylated in active genes but become methylated during gene silencing [^113ku2F3]. In contrast, CpG shores and shelves — regions flanking CpG islands — show dynamic methylation changes in response to environmental cues and developmental signals [^116B2tmZ].

---

## Consequences of aberrant cytosine methylation

Aberrant cytosine methylation patterns are associated with **various diseases**, including:

- **Cancer**: Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters leads to gene silencing and tumorigenesis, while global hypomethylation contributes to genomic instability [^114diCoi].
- **Neurological disorders**: Abnormal methylation patterns are implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism and Alzheimer's disease [^113t7Ubs].
- **Metabolic disorders**: Methylation dysregulation affects genes involved in metabolism, contributing to diseases such as obesity and diabetes [^notfound].

---

## Methods for detecting cytosine methylation

Several **techniques** are used to detect and quantify cytosine methylation:

- **Bisulfite sequencing**: Gold standard method that converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, allowing distinction between methylated and unmethylated cytosine residues [^115aH5DY].
- **Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)**: Rapid and sensitive method for detecting methylation at specific loci [^notfound].
- **Whole-genome methylation sequencing**: Provides comprehensive, single-base resolution maps of methylation across the entire genome [^113t7Ubs].

## Comparison with other nucleotide bases

| **Nucleotide base** | **Methylation at 5' position** | **Biological significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Cytosine | Yes | - Major epigenetic mark <br/> - Gene regulation <br/> - Chromatin structure <br/> - Imprinting <br/> - X-chromosome inactivation [^116XEMnt] |
| Adenine | No | Not a standard modification in human DNA |
| Thymine | No | Already methylated at position 5; no additional methylation occurs |
| Guanine | No | Not methylated at the 5' position in human DNA |

---

Cytosine is the **only nucleotide base in human DNA** that is methylated at the 5' position, forming 5-methylcytosine. This modification is central to epigenetic regulation, influencing gene expression, chromatin structure, and genomic stability. Aberrant methylation patterns are linked to numerous diseases, underscoring the importance of this modification in human biology.

### Aptazyme-embedded guide RNAs enable ligand-responsive genome editing and transcriptional activation [^11428fcc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Guanine-dependent transcriptional activation

In addition to genome editing, transcriptional regulation is another widely used application of CRISPR technology. To further explore the utility of agRNAs, we sought to develop an agRNA that responds to a different small-molecule ligand and activates the expression of a guide RNA-specified target gene, rather than editing a target gene through nuclease-mediated double-strand break. A previously reported guanine aptazymethat contains a naturally occurring guanine aptamerwas incorporated into the guide RNA and the resulting guanine-agRNA was tested for its ability to activate transcription of a GFP gene in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3c). The guanine-agRNA targeted the sequence upstream of a modified promoter for the GFP gene and recruited the fusion of catalytically inactive dCas9 with tandem mammalian transcriptional activators VP64-p65-Rta (dCas9-VPR). In the presence of an active guide RNA, dCas9-VPR initiates transcription of GFP, ultimately resulting in cell fluorescence.

Similar to the theophylline-agRNA, the guanine-agRNA also exhibited detectable off-state activity, resulting in elevated GFP fluorescence in the absence of guanine compared to control cells lacking any guide RNA (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 4). We attribute the elevated off-state activity to the presence of endogenous guanine, as well as basal self-cleaving activity of the guanine aptazyme in the absence of the small molecule. When guanine was added to media at a concentration of 50 μM, however, a fivefold activation of GFP fluorescence was observed in cells that were transfected with guanine-agRNA expression plasmid. In contrast, no GFP activation was detected in control cells lacking guide RNA or in control cells expressing non-cleaving dHHR-bsgRNA (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, the non-splicing mutant (d)guanine-agRNA resulted in only a low level of GFP expression that could no longer be activated by guanine (Supplementary Fig. 5). Indeed, increasing the concentration of guanine in the medium from 0 to 200 μM slightly reduced GFP fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that guanine might have a modest negative effect on cell fluorescence and the actual activation ratio of the guanine-agRNA could be higher than was calculated from GFP fluorescence.

### A guanine-flipping and sequestration mechanism for G-quadruplex unwinding by recQ helicases [^112EeBvi]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

RecQ contains a guanine-specific pocket

Examination of the structure revealed an unexpectedly specific arrangement for binding to the unwound G4 product (Fig. 1b–d). The 3′-most guanine base of the G4-forming sequence (G21), which is the first base within the folded G4 that would be encountered by the 3′–5′ translocating RecQ enzyme, was found sequestered in a guanine-specific pocket (GSP) on the surface of RecQ. The GSP forms hydrogen bonds with the guanine base using the sidechain hydroxyl and backbone amide of Ser245 and the sidechain carboxyl group from Asp312 of RecQ (Fig. 1c). These contacts are uniquely selective for guanine and, strikingly, they substitute for all of the hydrogen bonds that stabilize guanines within G4 structures. The base is further stabilized by base stacking against a cytosine base two nucleotides 3′ of the flipped base (C23). The GSP is capped on the 5ʹ end by the hydrophobic portion of the Lys248 sidechain and by Trp347 on the 3′ side (Fig. 1d). Lys222 and Lys248 make additional contacts with the phosphodiester backbone of the unfolded DNA, anchoring it against the helicase domain (Supplementary Fig. 3). Given this arrangement, guanine-binding to RecQ is incompatible with its position within a folded G4. Instead it appears that the guanine must flip from within a G-quartet to be sequestered in the RecQ GSP. In both DNA-free and duplex DNA-bound bacterial RecQ structures, access to the GSP is occluded by Lys248, which folds to interact with Asp312 from the GSP. However, the GSP is open to accept the guanine base in the RecQ/G4 product complex (Supplementary Fig. 4). These observations suggested a possible model in which guanine-flipping and GSP-mediated base-specific sequestration support RecQ unwinding of G4 DNA.

Guanine ribonucleotides inhibit telomere lengthening in human cells

We next asked whether metabolites of guanine caused the strong telomerase inhibition we observed in the TRACE assay. Guanine can either be salvaged as guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), or further catabolized into xanthine and uric acid by guanine deaminase (GDA) and xanthine oxidase, respectively (Fig. 2f). To test whether guanine breakdown products caused telomerase inhibition, we compared the effects of directly supplementing cells with guanine, xanthine, or uric acid in the TRACE assay. Whereas guanine supplementation potently inhibited telomerase reverse transcriptase activity, xanthine and uric acid had minimal effects at doses up to 500 µM (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 2c–e). As a complementary approach to evaluate whether the accumulation of guanine catabolic products drives telomerase inhibition, we tested the xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostatin the TRACE assay, and found it was unable to rescue telomerase activity from treatment with either dG, guanosine, or guanine (Fig. 2h). Together, these findings indicated that guanine rather than its downstream degradation products is responsible for telomerase inhibition in cells.

### Scalable control of stem cell fate by riboswitch-regulated RNA viral vector without genomic integration [^11697CQd]. Molecular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Scale bars, 100 μm.

The infected mESCs maintained their colonies with rounded cell morphology before MyoD induction (Figures 5 C and S5). On days 3 and 5, few spindle-like cells emerged in the cells cultured without guanine (Figures 5 C and S5). Analyses of the endogenous gene expression by qPCR of the total RNAs showed reduced expression levels of the pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog in the cells cultured with and without guanine, although the cells in which Myod1 expression was induced by removing guanine showed more pronounced reduction at days 5 and 7 (Figures 5 D and S5 B). Myogenic cell-specific mRNA levels (Myogenin and Myf5) sharply increased in the absence of guanine from day 3 to day 5, but they remained suppressed in the presence of guanine (Figures 5 D and S5 B). Upregulation of myogenic cell-specific mRNA levels matches the emergence of spindle-like cells in the absence of guanine (Figures 5 C, 5D, S5 A, and S5B). Immunofluorescence staining of the cells on day 7 showed myosin heavy chain (MHC:MyHC) expression in the spindle-like cells found in the cells without guanine, but not in the rounded cells cultured with guanine (Figures 5 E, S5 C, and S5D). VSV-N expression was observed in cells cultured with and without guanine, indicating that the VSV vector is stably maintained under these conditions. Thus, these results demonstrate that a transgene differentiation factor can be stably maintained in mESCs infected with the VSV vector without inducing differentiation in the presence of guanine and puromycin, and its expression can be induced by removing guanine to efficiently differentiate mESCs to a specific cell type.

### The glutamine antagonist prodrug JHU-083 slows malignant glioma growth and disrupts mTOR signaling [^113sbn7r]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Guanine Partially Restores JHU-083 Antiproliferative Effect and mTOR Signaling

Glutamine is essential to de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis through γ-nitrogen donation. In glioblastoma stem-like cells, carbons derived from glucose are used in de novo purine synthesis pathway. In addition, enzymes associated with purine biosynthesis pathway are upregulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells. It has been shown that DON can directly inhibit glutamine amidotransferase activity and compromise de novo nucleotide synthesis. Therefore, considering glutaminolysis had small impact on JHU-083-mediated cell proliferation inhibition, it was reasonable to test whether guanine and adenine impact cell proliferation. Guanine treatment partially rescued the JHU-083 antiproliferative effect in BT142 cells (IDH mut), but not in Br23c cell line (IDH wild type) (Figure 5A). Additionally, BT142 cells supplemented with guanine in the presence of DON partially restored cell proliferation (Figure 5B). Adenine showed small cell proliferation recovery in BT142 cells treated with JHU-083. To complement the cell proliferation assay, we measured DNA synthesis by BrdU incorporation in this condition (Figure 5C). Guanine at different concentrations was found to restore pS6(ser235/236), pAKT(ser473), and Cyclin D1 protein expression in BT142 cells cotreated with JHU-083 (Figure 5D). The combination of guanine with adenine or DM-αKG in cells treated with JHU-083 did not further rescue cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure 5). These data suggest that guanine abrogates JHU-083-mediated cell proliferation reduction and mTOR signaling downregulation. Based on this model proposed and the data acquired in Figure 5A–D, we wondered whether the effect of cell proliferation inhibition induced by JHU-083 is dependent on mTOR signaling. Cells treated with JHU-083 and guanine in the presence of mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) reduced pAKT(ser473) and pS6(ser235/236) and further reduced Cyclin D1 protein expression (Figure 5E). Everolimus as single agent reduced cell proliferation and this effect was enhanced in combination with JHU-083. Guanine in the presence of JHU-083 and everolimus did not restore cell proliferation (Figure 5F). Taken together, these results demonstrate the requirement of mTORC1 signaling activation to recovery cell proliferation induced by guanine in cells treated with JHU-083.

### A guanine-flipping and sequestration mechanism for G-quadruplex unwinding by recQ helicases [^113iZ7Zc]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In the G4 unwinding model, RecQ first recognizes a ssDNA/G4 junction, placing the G4 in a position adjacent to the GSP and leaving the pocket poised to receive the 3′-most guanine from a G-quartet as it flips from the folded structure (Fig. 3). For the structural studies described here, guanine sequestration appears sufficient to unfold a G4 with three guanine quartet planes. ATP-dependent RecQ translocation would then slide the 3′-most guanine base out of the GSP, moving it along the face of the helicase domain and allowing the next guanine to be sequestered within the GSP as the G4 structure is resolved. What then gives rise to the repetitive cycles of G4 unwinding and refolding that have been observed in single-molecule experiments,? Two possibilities may explain this phenomenon. First, since RecQ must release the first guanine to advance along the DNA, it may be that the base can either slide along the ssDNA binding face of RecQ to promote unwinding or it can flip back and allow the G4 structure to refold (Fig. 3). It is possible that G4 reformation is more efficient than processive translocation, which would lead to repetitive rounds of unwinding and refolding. Second, although the GSP matches the hydrogen-bonding pattern for a guanine in a folded G4, it may form a complex that is less stable than that found in the context of a G4, which includes base stacking and ionic stabilization in addition to hydrogen bonding. If RecQ transiently captures a frayed guanine from the 3′ end of the G4 and if translocation is slower than the rate at which the guanine can transition back into the folded G4, this difference could allow the captured guanine to be released and the G4 to reform, resulting in a cycle of G4 unwinding and refolding.

### 8-oxoguanine: from oxidative damage to epigenetic and epitranscriptional modification [^111qXYpw]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

8-Oxoguanine in DNA

8-Oxo-dG

As accurate transmission of genomic information is essential to preserve genome stability, DNA must be protected from the accumulation of mutations. Genomes are continually threatened by chemical assaults, including ROS, alkylating reagents, ultraviolet light, and carcinogens. It is estimated that an average of ~70,000 nucleobases are damaged in each human cell every day. As damaged DNA can result in deleterious mutations, cells trigger specific DNA damage responses to defend and repair these changes (e.g. cell cycle checkpoint and BER pathways). Among this damage, DNA oxidation is the most abundant and relevant to diverse redox-mediated biological consequences (e.g. inflammation and stress-induced premature senescence). Currently, over 100 oxidative DNA adducts have been identified, ranging from those with modifications of the bases (e.g. 8-oxo-dG, 8-oxo-dA, thymidine glycol, 5-hydroxylcytosine, and 5-hydroxyuracil) and nucleotides (abasic or cyclic forms; e.g. 2-deoxyribonolactone, 5′,8-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine, and 5′,8-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine) to those with breakage of the phosphate backbone.

Due to the lowest redox potential of guanine relative to the other bases (G: –3.0 V, A: –2.71 V, C: –2.56 V, and T: –2.32 V), 8-oxo-dG is the most prevalent oxidized form generated by reacting with oxygen at the C8 position, of which the double bond in guanine is directly attacked by the hydroxyl radical (• OH). 8-Oxo-dG is estimated to be present at approximately 0.5 per Mbp (millions of base pairs; steady state of the human lymphocyte genome). The redox potential of guanine oxidation is largely affected by the flanking sequence composition, at which purine-rich sequences, specifically guanine at the 5′-end or GG repeats, and those neighboring oxidized bases are favored, presumably due to the migration of radical cations. Two or more oxidative lesions often occur within 10 bp, called oxidative clustered DNA lesions (OCDLs). The OCDL level is 0.02 to 0.8 per Mbp in normal human primary and cancer cells. Some OCDLs seem more difficult to repair than individual lesions, and are thus more likely to induce pathological mutations.

### Macromolecular sheets direct the morphology and orientation of plate-like biogenic guanine crystals [^1168VtfP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Animals precisely control the morphology and assembly of guanine crystals to produce diverse optical phenomena in coloration and vision. However, little is known about how organisms regulate crystallization to produce optically useful morphologies which express highly reflective crystal faces. Guanine crystals form inside iridosome vesicles within chromatophore cells called iridophores. By following iridosome formation in developing scallop eyes, we show that pre-assembled, fibrillar sheets provide an interface for nucleation and direct the orientation of the guanine crystals. The macromolecular sheets cap the (100) faces of immature guanine crystals, inhibiting growth along the π-stacking growth direction. Crystal growth then occurs preferentially along the sheets to generate highly reflective plates. Despite their different physical properties, the morphogenesis of iridosomes bears a striking resemblance to melanosome morphogenesis in vertebrates, where amyloid sheets template melanin deposition. The common control mechanisms for melanin and guanine formation inspire new approaches for manipulating the morphologies and properties of molecular materials.

### Metabolic constraint of human telomere length by nucleotide salvage efficiency [^111cYmfU]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To study these effects under conditions with physiologic telomerase expression, we treated unmanipulated 293 T or K562 cells with 100 µM guanine for 21 days and found reproducible telomere shortening (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Fig. 2f). To test this in diploid primary cells, we treated normal human fibroblasts in which TERT was stably expressed with guanine for 21 days, and similarly observed inhibition of telomere lengthening (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Fig. 2f). Collectively, these results demonstrate that conversion of guanosine and dG into guanine causes inhibition of telomerase reverse transcription, and show that guanine supplementation itself can shorten telomeres in human cancer cell lines with endogenous telomerase levels.

We next asked if guanine supplementation requires its salvage into cellular ribonucleotide pools via HGPRT to cause telomerase inhibition. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated HPRT1 deficient TERC −/− 293 T cells and verified efficient on-target gene inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 2g, h). We similarly used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate TERC −/− 293 T cells deficient for APRT, encoding adenine phosphoribosyltransferase which converts adenine to AMP, and GDA encoding guanine deaminase which catabolizes guanine to xanthine (Supplementary Fig. 2i). The AAVS1 safe harbor locus was targeted as a control. Using the TRACE assay we found that, relative to control cells, the inhibitory effects of guanosine, dG and guanine on telomerase activity were abrogated after HPRT1 inactivation (Fig. 2j, k). In comparison, telomerase inhibition by guanine in GDA- or APRT- targeted cells was similar to controls (Fig. 2l, Supplementary Fig. 2j, k). Collectively, these data support a model where treatment with guanosine, dG, or guanine leads to inhibition of telomerase reverse transcriptase activity via the salvage of guanine by HGPRT to form guanine ribonucleotides.

### Scalable control of stem cell fate by riboswitch-regulated RNA viral vector without genomic integration [^1122udfa]. Molecular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

After mESCs infected with Nanog-VSV were cultured in different ribavirin and guanine concentrations for 15 days, the cells were further cultured for 3 days without ribavirin and guanine. VSV-N expression was detected to evaluate the remaining VSV vector in the cells, and SSEA-1 expression was also detected to confirm that the cells maintained pluripotency at a level similar to that of the uninfected mESCs (Figures 4, S3, and S4). The percentage of cells expressing VSV-N on day 15 was lower in cells treated with guanine (10.6%–46.2%) than in those that were not (83.9%) (Figure 4 B, day 15, Exp1). Notably, percentage of the cells expressing VSV-N treated with 909 μM ribavirin and 100 μM guanine (10.6%) was significantly lower among the cells treated with guanine. An additional 3 days of culture (day 18) without ribavirin and guanine in all conditions resulted in an overall decrease in the percentage of VSV-N-positive cells, which indicated that VSV replication was not restored in the cells after the removal of guanine and ribavirin. The relative viral RNA levels measured by qRT-PCR were consistent with the corresponding protein levels (Figures S3 and S4). The cells treated with 909 μM ribavirin and 100 μM guanine showed 1.8% VSV-N-positive cells, which is comparable with that of the uninfected mESCs (0.7%). In summary, 15 days of VSV-infected mESCs cultured with ribavirin and guanine followed by 3 days of culture without ribavirin and guanine successfully attenuated VSV-N expression. Another experiment that was carried out using independently infected mESCs (Exp2) also showed the same trends (Figures 4 and S4).

### Strand breaks in X-irradiated crystalline DNA: alternating CG oligomers [^112KTCjf]. Radiation Research (2003). Low credibility.

Direct ionization of crystalline d(CGCGCGCG) and d(CGCGCGCGCG) oligomers produces 3'- and 5'-phosphate-terminated fragments as the main strand breakage products detectable by ion-exchange chromatography. The nature of the base has no effect on the probability of strand breakage at the given site. The yields of 3'-phosphates are systematically lower than the yields of the 5'-phosphates originating from the same cleavage site, pointing to the possible presence of unidentified products with sugar remnants attached to the 3'-end. These results show that direct ionization is efficient at producing single-strand breaks in DNA and its action is relatively indiscriminate with respect to base sequence.

DNA methylation marks the locations of pre-miRNA boundaries

To test if DNA methylation affects miRNA biogenesis, we first analyzed the GC content (the proportion of guanine and cytosine nucleotides relative to the total number of nucleotides) of all pre-miRNA loci in the human and mouse genomes. Pre-miRNA loci were scaled to a length of 100 base pairs (bp) and a mean GC level was determined for each base pair. Pre-miRNA coding regions have higher GC content compared to the adjacent upstream and downstream regions (Fig. 1a, top panel). We repeated this analysis with the CpG dinucleotide content (the proportion of CpG dinucleotides relative to the total number of dinucleotides) and observed the same result (Fig. 1a, middle panel). The higher frequency of CpG dinucleotides offers a higher chance for CpG methylation to occur in these regions.

Nelarabine is a prodrug of the deoxyguanosine analogue 9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G), a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor. Nelarabine is demethylated by ADA to ara-G, mono-phosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase, and subsequently converted to the active 5'-triphosphate, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in leukemic blasts allows for incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to the cytotoxic and systemic toxicity of nelarabine.

Inhibition of guanine biosynthesis reduces rRNA synthesis

We then sought to understand the mechanisms by which inhibition of guanine biosynthesis promotes LSC differentiation. IMPDH inhibition reduces guanosine nucleotides (Fig. 3g) used for DNA and RNA synthesis. Flux analysis with 13 C 6 -glucose in murine LSCs revealed higher labeling in GTP than dGTP, suggesting a higher GTP synthesis rate (Fig. 5a), consistent with the higher utilization rate of GTP compared to other nucleotides in rRNA synthesis. Thus, we reasoned that the myeloid differentiation of LSCs caused by inhibiting guanine nucleotide biosynthesis could be associated with disruption of rRNA transcription. To test this, we examined the impact of guanine biosynthesis inhibition on rRNA transcription. Compared to Gapdh pre-mRNA, the level of pre-rRNA was significantly reduced by MMF treatment, which was rescued by guanosine supplementation (Fig. 5b). Additionally, disruption of guanine biosynthesis through IMPDH2 deletion in MOLM-13 cells resulted in reduced rRNA synthesis, which was reversed by the addition of guanosine (Supplementary Fig. 5a). These data establish the critical role of guanine biosynthesis in RNA pol I-mediated rRNA transcription. If rRNA biosynthesis is a major consumer of guanine nucleosides, then inhibition of RNA polymerase I that is responsible for rRNA transcription should alleviate the reduction of guanine nucleosides caused by MMF. We thus exposed LSCs to MMF and/or CX-5461, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase I, and measured guanine nucleosides levels (Fig. 5c). Compared to lactate, an internal control unaffected by MMF or CX-5461, MMF significantly reduced guanosine mono, di, and trinucleotides levels while increasing AMP/ADP levels. Inhibition of rRNA synthesis by CX-5461 blocked the utilization of guanine nucleosides and normalized the reduced guanine nucleosides levels caused by MMF (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, inhibition of rRNA transcription by CX-5461 or BMH-21, another RNA polymerase I inhibitor that blocks transcriptional initiation and elongation, induced myeloid differentiation of LSCs (Fig. 5d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5b), phenocopying the effects of inhibiting guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. We then tested whether dysregulated rRNA transcription and processing accompanies morphological changes of the nucleoli. To this end, we knocked in a monomeric NeonGreen (mNeonGreen) cassette in the NPM1 locus of THP-1 cells. Both MMF and CX-5461 treatment reduced the size of NPM1-labeled nucleoli (Fig. 5f). These data demonstrate that inhibition of nucleolar rRNA synthesis, either directly by inhibiting RNA polymerase I or by inhibiting guanine biosynthesis, promotes myeloid differentiation of LSCs.

### Do clinical features of lesch-nyhan disease correlate more closely with hypoxanthine or guanine recycling? [^111Avq4a]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare, X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt), an enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. HGprt has two functions; it recycles hypoxanthine and guanine. Which of these two functions is more relevant for pathogenesis is unclear because some evidence points to hypoxanthine recycling, but other evidence points to guanine recycling. In this study, we selectively assayed hypoxanthine (Hprt) and guanine (Gprt) recycling in skin fibroblasts from 17 persons with LND, 11 with an attenuated variant of the disease (LNV), and 19 age-, sex-, and race-matched healthy controls (HC). Activity levels of both enzymes differed across groups (p < 0.0001), but only Gprt distinguished patients with LND from those with LNV (p < 0.05). Gprt also showed slightly stronger correlations than Hprt with 13 of 14 measures of the clinical phenotype, including the severity of dystonia, cognitive impairment, and behavioral abnormalities. These findings suggest that loss of guanine recycling might be more closely linked to the LND/LNV phenotype than loss of hypoxanthine recycling.

### A guanine-flipping and sequestration mechanism for G-quadruplex unwinding by recQ helicases [^116TaRvJ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Homeostatic regulation of G-quadruplexes (G4s), four-stranded structures that can form in guanine-rich nucleic acids, requires G4 unwinding helicases. The mechanisms that mediate G4 unwinding remain unknown. We report the structure of a bacterial RecQ DNA helicase bound to resolved G4 DNA. Unexpectedly, a guanine base from the unwound G4 is sequestered within a guanine-specific binding pocket. Disruption of the pocket in RecQ blocks G4 unwinding, but not G4 binding or duplex DNA unwinding, indicating its essential role in structure-specific G4 resolution. A novel guanine-flipping and sequestration model that may be applicable to other G4-resolving helicases emerges from these studies.

### Polarisation of prokaryotic chromosomes [^113cUA7Y]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

In many prokaryotes, asymmetrical mutational or selective pressures have caused compositional skews between complementary strands of replication arms, especially sensitive in the distribution of guanine and cytosine. In Escherichia coli, most of the guanine/cytosine skew is caused by mutation rates differing on leading and lagging strands, but contribution of skewed functionally important guanine-rich motifs (Chi and Rag sites), which control chromosome repair or positioning, is noticeable. Interference between replication and gene expression plays a minor role. The situation may be different in other bacteria. Studies of chromosome processing and bacterial taxonomy might profit from consideration of chromosome polarisation.

### How cyanophage S-2L rejects adenine and incorporates 2-aminoadenine to saturate hydrogen bonding in its DNA [^116FvWxJ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

All living organisms use the same elementary bricks for their genetic material, namely four, and only four, nucleobases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). However, certain viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) use modified bases to escape their host's defence system, especially their endonucleases. Most of the observed DNA modifications occur at position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of purines that face the major groove of the DNA double helix. Methylation on N4 of cytosine or N6 of adenine are also observed in viruses. For pyrimidines, DNA containing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine has long been known to exist in phages T2, T4 and T6, along with the enzyme (deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase) responsible for its biosynthesis; more complicated post-replicative pathways of thymine hypermodification were recently found in phages and recreated in vitro. For purines, archaeosine, a modified 7-deaza analogue of guanine observed in archaeal tRNA D-loopwas found in the genome of the E. coli siphophage 9 g, and is possibly present in another siphophage BRET; their genomes encode genes (QueC, QueD, QueE) necessary for the biosynthesis of guanine modification. Recently, three additional 7-deazaguanine analogues have been identified and characterised in the genomes of phages and archaeal viruses. An important point is to distinguish between replicative and post-replicative DNA modifications: if a biosynthetic pathway can be identified for the synthesis of the triphosphate of the modified nucleotide, it is reasonable to assume that the modified base is incorporated during replication and is not the result of a post-replicative modification.

### Pairing of isolated nucleic-acid bases in the absence of the DNA backbone [^116NFypg]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The two intertwined strands of DNA are held together through base pairing — the formation of hydrogen bonds between bases located opposite each other on the two strands. DNA replication and transcription involve the breaking and re-forming of these hydrogen bonds, but it is difficult to probe these processes directly. For example, conventional DNA spectroscopy is dominated by solvent interactions, crystal modes and collective modes of the DNA backbone; gas-phase studies, in contrast, can in principle measure interactions between individual molecules in the absence of external effects, but require the vaporization of the interacting species without thermal degradation. Here we report the generation of gas-phase complexes comprising paired bases, and the spectroscopic characterization of the hydrogen bonding in isolated guanine-cytosine (G-C) and guanine-guanine (G-G) base pairs. We find that the gas-phase G-C base pair adopts a single configuration, which may be Watson-Crick, whereas G-G exists in two different configurations, and we see evidence for proton transfer in the G-C pair, an important step in radiation-induced DNA damage pathways. Interactions between different bases and between bases and water molecules can also be characterized by our approach, providing stringent tests for high-level ab initio computations that aim to elucidate the fundamental aspects of nucleotide interactions.

Unrepaired 8-oxo-dG results in G > T transversion (same as C > A) during DNA replication (lower left panel). ROS induce oxidation of free nucleotide (8-oxo-dGTP), which is actively hydrolyzed by MTH1 (8-oxo-dGMP) to prevent its incorporation from DNA replication. The unrepaired 8-oxo-dG results in an A > C mutation (same as T > G; lower panel).

Upon exposure to oxidative stress, guanine in RNA is more vulnerable to producing o 8 G than guanine in DNA, but less attention has been given to o 8 G because RNA is a relatively unstable and temporal intermediate. Nonetheless, inappropriate o 8 G•A base pairing impacts RNA structure and functions at the posttranscriptional level; o 8 G induces translational errors, and its extensive occurrence in mRNA deteriorates translational activity. Therefore, damaged RNAs generally undergo decay via surveillance mechanisms for RNA quality control. Beyond damage, o 8 G can serve as an epitranscriptional modification that alters regulatory RNA–RNA interactions in a redox-dependent manner.

Currently, there are an increasing number of studies on the epigenetic, and epitranscriptionalroles of 8-oxoguanine. Here, we review the functions of 8-oxoguanine as an oxidative modification in DNA (8-oxo-dG) and RNA (o 8 G), describing oxidative damage, which necessitates repair or quality control, and regulatory mechanisms for redox-mediated gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

### Clinical severity in lesch-nyhan disease: the role of residual enzyme and compensatory pathways [^114jH2jK]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which encodes the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt), cause Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) and more mildly affected Lesch-Nyhan variants. Prior studies have suggested a strong correlation between residual hypoxanthine recycling activity and disease severity. However, the relevance of guanine recycling and compensatory changes in the de novo synthesis of purines has received little attention. In the current studies, fibroblast cultures were established for 21 healthy controls and 36 patients with a broad spectrum of disease severity related to HGprt deficiency. We assessed hypoxanthine recycling, guanine recycling, steady-state purine pools, and de novo purine synthesis. There was a strong correlation between disease severity and either hypoxanthine or guanine recycling. Intracellular purines were normal in the HGprt-deficient fibroblasts, but purine wasting was evident as increased purine metabolites excreted from the cells. The normal intracellular purines in the HGprt-deficient fibroblasts were likely due in part to a compensatory increase in purine synthesis, as demonstrated by a significant increase in purinosomes. However, the increase in purine synthesis did not appear to correlate with disease severity. These results refine our understanding of the potential sources of phenotypic heterogeneity in LND and its variants.

Recap of the human genome: the very basics

Sequencing of the human genome was mostly completed in 2001, with the latest sequence published in 2023.3 billion base pair sequences make up the 63 494 genes in humans. These base pairs are organised within the DNA and fit into 23 pairs of chromosomes in a cell nucleus (figure 1). An additional 16 569 base pairs are housed within the mitochondria.

Figure 1
Genetic structure in humans. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.

Each base pair comprises two of four types of nucleotides — Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G). Humans share 99.5% of DNA with each other, and differences between individuals — whether in physical appearance or predisposition to disease — are usually due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An SNP is a single nucleotide substitution in a DNA sequence; for example, when a Thymine is replaced by Cytosine on one strand of the DNA, the original A-T pairing changes to A-C on that strand. During DNA replication, this consequently changes the complementary strand from A-T to G-C. The 'T' (original nucleotide) and 'C' (new nucleotide) are referred to as alleles at this SNP and the less common allele of the two in the population is referred to as the minor allele (figure 1).

Over 88 million SNPs have been mapped in the human genome. Each SNP occurs in at least 1% of the populationand contributes to the natural genetic diversity between humans. (If a substitution of a single nucleotide occurs in < 1% of the population, it is instead termed 'single nucleotide variant'.) SNPs are only one of several types of genetic variants, which is a term that refers to any alterations in the DNA sequence (eg, insertions, deletions and duplications) that can result in small or large-scale changes. One's susceptibility to any trait or disorder may be a result of pathogenic variants in a single (monogenic) or multiple genes across several chromosomes (polygenic).

### Guanine-derived radicals: dielectric constant-dependent stability and UV / vis spectral properties: a DFT study [^114shjWf]. Radiation Research (2008). Low credibility.

Upon successive deprotonation of the guanine radical cation, various neutral radicals and radical anions can be formed. Their relative stability and UV/Vis absorption spectra have been calculated by DFT in the vacuum and in aqueous solution. Good agreement with experimental data is obtained when solvent effects are taken into account. The experimental observation that in the nucleosides deprotonation of the guanine radical cation occurs at N1 (formation of N1G(*)) in water and at N2 (formation of N2G(*)) in single crystals is now explained by a strong effect of the dielectric constant of the environment on their stability. While SCRF = PCM and CPCM (Gaussian 03) describe the trend, SCRF = DPCM (Gaussian 98) even shows the crossover from N2G(*) to N1G(*) at high dielectric constant. A crossover of the preferred deprotonation site is also given by the nucleoside itself. While for the gas phase a deprotonation at N2 is calculated to be favored over that at N1, the reverse is found for an aqueous environment (in agreement with the experiment). The radical anions of guanine, N9N1G(*)(-) and N9N2G(*)(-), are very similar in energy, but a comparison of the experimental and calculated UV/Vis spectra allows us to identify the experimentally observed intermediate clearly as N9N1G(*)(-).

### Endogenous melatonin and oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA [^112rkWKq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A significant body of literature indicates that melatonin, a hormone primarily produced nocturnally by the pineal gland, is an important scavenger of hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Melatonin may also lower the rate of DNA base damage resulting from hydroxyl radical attack and increase the rate of repair of that damage. This paper reports the results of a study relating the level of overnight melatonin production to the overnight excretion of the two primary urinary metabolites of the repair of oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA.

Methods

Mother-father-daughter(s) families (n = 55) were recruited and provided complete overnight urine samples. Total overnight creatinine-adjusted 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s/Cr) has been shown to be highly correlated with total overnight melatonin production. Urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-guanine (8-oxoGua) results from the repair of DNA or RNA guanine via the nucleobase excision repair pathway, while urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) may possibly result from the repair of DNA guanine via the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Total overnight urinary levels of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua are therefore a measure of total overnight guanine DNA damage. 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry assay. The mother, father, and oldest sampled daughter were used for these analyses. Comparisons between the mothers, fathers, and daughters were calculated for aMT6s/Cr, 8-oxodG, and 8-oxoGua. Regression analyses of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua on aMT6s/Cr were conducted for mothers, fathers, and daughters separately, adjusting for age and BMI (or weight).

Results

Among the mothers, age range 42–80, lower melatonin production (as measured by aMT6s/CR) was associated with significantly higher levels of 8-oxodG (p < 0.05), but not with 8-oxoGua. Among the fathers, age range 46–80, lower melatonin production was associated with marginally higher levels of 8-oxoGua (p < 0.07), but not with 8-oxodG. Among the daughters, no relationship was found between melatonin levels and either 8-oxodG or 8-oxoGua levels. When the mother and father data were further analyzed using only subjects older than the oldest daughter, the associations became somewhat stronger.

Conclusion

Low levels of endogenous melatonin production among older individuals may lead to higher levels of oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA, thereby possibly increasing the risk of developing cancer. The possible different effects of melatonin in the rates of utilization of pathways for repair of oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA identified between older women and older men are intriguing.

Amplification-based NGS library preparation — Amplification-based library preparation relies on multiplex PCR enrichment and can be one-stage or two-stage, is versatile and scalable, and can construct libraries such as Illumina's 26-gene TruSight Tumor panel and ThermoFisher's 409-gene AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel; hands-on time is typically shorter than hybridization capture. Limitations include allele dropout from single-nucleotide polymorphisms or short indels in primer regions leading to lower-than-expected coverage and incorrect variant allele frequency assessment, reduced effectiveness for high guanine-cytosine genes (e.g. CEBPA) or highly repetitive regions, potential failure to detect indels if primer sites are removed or amplicon size is sufficiently altered, and diminished sequencing quality at amplicon ends that can miscall variants; tiling amplicons to ensure overlap can ameliorate end-of-amplicon hotspot issues.

### Structure of a natural guanine-responsive riboswitch complexed with the metabolite hypoxanthine [^115A1udY]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Riboswitches are genetic regulatory elements found in the 5' untranslated region of messenger RNA that act in the absence of protein cofactors. They are broadly distributed across bacteria and account for the regulation of more than 2% of all genes in Bacillus subtilis, underscoring their importance in the control of cellular metabolism. The 5' untranslated region of many mRNAs of genes involved in purine metabolism and transport contain a guanine-responsive riboswitch that directly binds guanine, hypoxanthine or xanthine to terminate transcription. Here we report the crystal structure at 1.95 A resolution of the purine-binding domain of the guanine riboswitch from the xpt-pbuX operon of B. subtilis bound to hypoxanthine, a prevalent metabolite in the bacterial purine salvage pathway. This structure reveals a complex RNA fold involving several phylogenetically conserved nucleotides that create a binding pocket that almost completely envelops the ligand. Hypoxanthine functions to stabilize this structure and to promote the formation of a downstream transcriptional terminator element, thereby providing a mechanism for directly repressing gene expression in response to an increase in intracellular concentrations of metabolite.

### Genetics basics | Genomics and your health… [^111JmJhu]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Terms to know DNA DNA contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around each other and looks like a twisting ladder. Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases, which make up the DNA code. There are four different bases, T, A, C, and G. Each base on one strand of DNA is paired with a base on the other strand. The paired bases form the "rungs of the DNA ladder". The bases are in different orders on different parts of the DNA strand. DNA is "read" by the order of the bases, that is by the order of the Ts, Cs, Gs, and As. The order of these bases is what is known as the DNA sequence. The DNA in almost all living things is made up of the same parts. What's different is the DNA sequence.

The basic structure of a cell is a jelly-like substance known as cytoplasm, which is surrounded by a membrane to hold it together. Within the cytoplasm are various specialized structures that are important to the work of the cell. One of these structures is the cell nucleus, which contains the DNA packaged in chromosomes. DNA methylation DNA methylation works by adding a chemical to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes "off" and demethylation turns genes "on. " DNA methylation is one of the ways the body controls gene expression. Methylation and demethylation do not change the DNA code, but they help determine how much protein is made. Epigenetics change as people age, both as part of normal development and aging and because of exposure to environmental factors that happen over the course of a person's life.

There are several different ways an environmental factor can cause an epigenetic change to occur. One of the most common ways is by causing changes to DNA methylation. DNA methylation works by adding a chemical to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes "off" and demethylation turns genes "on. " Thus, environmental factors can impact the amount of protein a cell makes.

### 8-oxoguanine: from oxidative damage to epigenetic and epitranscriptional modification [^115r3uGY]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

8-Oxo-dG is highly mutagenic because of its propensity to pair with adenine in a syn conformation (Fig. 1a), causing a guanine-to-thymine mutation (G > T, the same as C > A) during DNA replication. DNA polymerase β (pol β) accommodates the 8-oxo-dG template in the syn conformation, hence incorporating adenine into the replicating strand (Fig. 1b). 8-Oxo-dG can be formed not only in DNA molecules but also in free nucleotides (Fig. 1b), the pools of which are especially vulnerable to oxidative damage (8-oxo-dGTP). As 8-oxo-dGTP provokes changes in the active site of pol β, its syn conformation can be inserted in the opposite adenine, avoiding recognition as damaged, thus resulting in an A > C mutation (the same as T > G) termed polymerase-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 1b).

### Direct detection of 8-oxo-dG using nanopore sequencing [^117B9GcV]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We observed that there is a significant general decrease in methylation levels around oxidized guanines compared to non-oxidized (Fig. 6 a, Methods, 8-oxo-dG related methylation analysis). The decrease in methylation levels correlates with distance to the oxidized base: it is lowest close to 8-oxo-dG (~45% methylation), and recovers to average genome-wide methylation levels at approximately 2000 bases from 8-oxo-dG (~54% methylation). This effect was observed irrespective of p53 status and DAAO H2B -derived H 2 O 2 production, suggesting a DNA damage independent relationship (Supplementary Fig. 35). We then grouped the data by 3-mer analogous to the profile analysis and observed that the decrease in methylation levels correlated with the 3-mer enrichment for 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 6 b, c). The decrease in methylation is largest for 3-mers with a CG motif, with the exception of CGT. A decrease in methylation is also observed for 3-mers without a CG motif, this is most apparent for GGA, which has a similar decrease in methylation level as compared to CG containing 3-mers. Interestingly, in 3-mers without a CG motif the methylation levels reached average genome wide levels at approximately 1 thousand base-pairs from 8-oxo-dG, while methylation levels in 3-mers with a CG motif did not return to baseline within 5kb from 8-oxo-dG [Figure 6 c]. Strangely, the AGG was the only 3-mer that displayed overall higher methylation levels for 8-oxo-dG containing molecules (Fig. 6 c). We observed that 5-hmC levels were slightly higher in 8-oxo-dG vs guanine containing regions (average ~3.5% vs ~3%) (Supplementary Fig. 36). Similarly to 5-mC, we did not observe p53 or H 2 O 2 dependent effects (Supplementary Fig. 37). However, upon inspection of the 5-hmC levels per 3-mer, we observed that there is no difference in 5-hmC levels per 3-mer with the exception of two cases (Supplementary Fig. 38). First, 5-hmC levels are highest around the GGA context, reaching an average of 6% in regions containing 8-oxo-dG. And secondly, the opposite effect happens in the CGA context, where 5-hmC levels are highest for regions with G (average ~5,8%) (Supplementary Fig. 38).

### Thioguanine (Tabloid) [^111YmfWr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Thioguanine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to 6-thioguanylic acid (TGMP). This nucleotide reaches high intracellular concentrations at therapeutic doses. TGMP interferes at several points with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides. It inhibits de novo purine biosynthesis by pseudo-feedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase — the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. TGMP also inhibits the conversion of inosinic acid (IMP) to xanthylic acid (XMP) by competition for the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase. At one time TGMP was felt to be a significant inhibitor of ATP:GMP phosphotransferase (guanylate kinase), but recent results have shown this not to be so.

Thioguanylic acid is further converted to the di- and tri-phosphates, thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) (as well as their 2′-deoxyribosyl analogues) by the same enzymes which metabolize guanine nucleotides. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the RNA and the DNA by phosphodiester linkages and it has been argued that incorporation of such fraudulent bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine.

### Fundamentals of DNA methylation in development [^113iHpUv]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

DNA methyation is critical to regulation of gene expression especially during developmentally dynamic changes. A large proportion occurs at CpG (a cytosine followed by a guanine nucleotide) sites and impacts gene expression based on location, timing and level of DNA methylation. The spectrum of effects produced by DNA methylation ranges from inhibition to enhancement of gene expression. Here basic terms and concepts in the study of DNA methylation are introduced. In addition, some of the commonly used techniques to assay DNA methylation are explained. New methods that allow the precise addition and removal of DNA methylation at specific sites will likely enhance our understanding of DNA methylation in development and may even lead to long-lasting therapeutic strategies to cure diseases. IMPACT: Fundamentals of DNA methylation including its significance are made accessible to a broad audience. Common assays for detecting DNA methylation are explained succinctly. Developmental patterns of DNA methylation detected in commonly used animal models are discussed and explained. Novel methodologies to investigate consequences of DNA methylation and demethylation are introduced.

### A guanine-flipping and sequestration mechanism for G-quadruplex unwinding by recQ helicases [^111FXP6k]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite the importance of G4 homeostasis in cells, our mechanistic understanding of quadruplex resolution has been hampered by a lack of structural information for G4-processing helicases. In this report, we have described the X-ray crystal structure of a RecQ helicase bound to a resolved G4. The structure identified a guanine-specific pocket, or GSP, in RecQ that sequesters a guanine base from the resolved G4. Guanine is selectively bound within the GSP via residues that form a pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that mimic the bonding pattern for a guanine within a G-quartet structure. As such, guanine-binding to the GSP is incompatible with a folded G4 structure and instead requires the base to be flipped away from the G4. These observations suggested a possible role for the GSP in G4 unwinding. In agreement with such a role, RecQ variants with altered guanine-binding residues failed to unwind G4 DNA, but they maintained their ability to unwind duplex DNA. Our data collectively support an unexpectedly specific helicase mechanism for RecQ unwinding of G4 structures that relies on guanine base flipping and sequestration for G4 resolution.

### Understanding the structural and dynamic consequences of DNA epigenetic modifications: computational insights into cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation [^116Fo1j5]. Epigenetics (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 4.
Top: Radial distribution functions for the added cytosine methyl group (red) in the 3-DNA sequence and the corresponding hydrogen in the unmodified base (black). Integration of the first peak for the 3-DNA structure results in 10 water molecules, whereas the first peak for unmethylated corresponds to 7 water molecules. The difference is caused by the water molecule's CH… O dipole-dipole interactions with the methyl group. Bottom: Radial distribution functions for one of the amino hydrogens (atom H41) in the methylated (red) and unmodified (black) cytosine in the 3-DNA sequence. Compared to the methylated sequence, the WT amino hydrogen has a much higher probability of interacting with a water molecule.

Figure 5.
Surface representation of the water molecules within 3.5 Å from the DNA. This figure shows both the hydrophobic region created by the extra methyl group, and the hydrophobic regions already present and created by the 2 methyl groups of the thymine bases.

This effect is not observed for the 9-DNA structure, since both the methylated base and the 2 thymine bases are in the same strand, and then the twisting of the structure would not lead to any proximity between the hydrophobic regions (Fig. 2). The opposite scenario occurs with regard to the roll and tilt parameters, where we observe differences in the 9-DNA structure and in 3,9-DNA structures, but not in the 3-DNA structure. This local bending can also be a consequence of the proximity of the methyl groups of the modified cytosine bases and of the thymine bases lying in the major groove (Fig. 2).

The central part of the dodecamer is an A-tract with 4 A/T base pairs, a sequence that has its own intrinsic properties including a fully methylated major groove. We have previously shown that continuous major groove methylation affects both the structure and dynamics of dsDNA by improving base stacking and probably also by modulating water binding. Thus, it might be of significance that methylation of d(CGCGAATTCGCG) 2 at position 9 creates a 6 bases long spine of major groove methyl groups, that double-methylation at positions 3 and 9 provides 8 consecutive methyl groups, and that the methyl group afforded by single methylation at position 3 remains isolated (Fig. 2).

### A study of pyrimidine base damage in relation to oxidative stress and cancer [^1152dm75]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

A principal concern in the interpretation of the results of Table 2 is a potential age factor. Figures 3 and 4 display the range and distribution of ages for the patient and control groups. The distributions are plotted vs the levels of d(P f pA) and d(T g pA), respectively. The age distributions for cases and controls are not identical. An ad hoc, but insightful, approach to evaluating age as a possible confounding factor. The control data to the equation y = a x+ b, where y stands for the level of damage, d(P f pA), and x stands for the age of the individual in years. A least squares best fit of the d(P f pA) data as a function of age yielded values of 0.090 fmol μ g −1 per year and 1.343 fmol μ g −1 for a and b, respectively. These values were used to calculate the expected levels of d(P f pA) in cancer patients based on their individual ages. The mean value of d(P f pA) for the 19 cancer patients was calculated. The value of 5.57 fmol μ g −1 was obtained which is substantially the same value listed in Table 2. Thus, the relevance of the higher measured level of d(P f pA) in cancer patients compared with controls is of doubtful significance. On the other hand, the levels for d(T g pA) appear to be more meaningful. The least squares best fit for the control data of Figure 4 yielded values of 0.023 fmol μ g −1 per year and 1.081 fmol μ g −1. The calculated mean value of d(T g pA) in cancer patients was 2.16 fmol μ g −1 which is significantly below the measured value of 2.83 fmol μ g −1.

### 8-oxoguanine: from oxidative damage to epigenetic and epitranscriptional modification [^114Tzs7T]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In pathophysiology, reactive oxygen species control diverse cellular phenotypes by oxidizing biomolecules. Among these, the guanine base in nucleic acids is the most vulnerable to producing 8-oxoguanine, which can pair with adenine. Because of this feature, 8-oxoguanine in DNA (8-oxo-dG) induces a G > T (C > A) mutation in cancers, which can be deleterious and thus actively repaired by DNA repair pathways. 8-Oxoguanine in RNA (o 8 G) causes problems in aberrant quality and translational fidelity, thereby it is subjected to the RNA decay pathway. In addition to oxidative damage, 8-oxo-dG serves as an epigenetic modification that affects transcriptional regulatory elements and other epigenetic modifications. With the ability of o 8 G•A in base pairing, o 8 G alters structural and functional RNA–RNA interactions, enabling redirection of posttranscriptional regulation. Here, we address the production, regulation, and function of 8-oxo-dG and o 8 G under oxidative stress. Primarily, we focus on the epigenetic and epitranscriptional roles of 8-oxoguanine, which highlights the significance of oxidative modification in redox-mediated control of gene expression.

### Assessing alternative base substitutions at primer CpG sites to optimise unbiased PCR amplification of methylated sequences [^115aH5DY]. Clinical Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

The approach of using limited cytosines at CpG dinucleotides to match methylated sequences in the forward primers (and guanines in the reverse primers) has been used to compensate for a potential bias towards the amplification of unmethylated DNA when "methylation-independent primers" are used. However, in these experiments for both primer pairs assessed, primers with sequences at the variable position matching the methylated templates overestimated the DNA methylation content (Fig. 2) at all annealing temperatures, with the effect being more pronounced at the higher temperatures.

Fig. 2
Effect of substitutions and temperature on bias for homogeneously methylated templates. The rows represent the different substitutions at the variable sites. C primers matched the methylated template sequence (C in the forward primer, G in the reverse), I primers had inosines, Y primers had a C/T degeneracy (A/G in the reverse), N primers had totally degenerate bases (A/T/C/G), mm primers had mismatches (A in the forward primer and T in the reverse primer) and ab primers had abasic sites. The columns represent the annealing temperatures tested. For each assay, the average methylation percentage as measured at each CpG by bisulfite pyrosequencing across the amplicon is shown. The final CpG in both assays was not used in the calculations of the average methylation across the amplicon as the pyrosequencing measurement was consistently lower than expected for a homogeneously methylated template and was called as inaccurate by the software. The annealing temperature increases along the x -axis by 2 °C for each step as indicated. The mismatched (mm) primers for CDKN2B used different annealing temperatures as indicated but were still used in 2 °C increments. The colour scales were set so that the target measurement reflecting the actual level of methylation is shown as white (25 in the 25% methylated templates (panel a) and 50 in the 50% methylated templates (panel b)). Because of this, the same methylation values have different colours for the 25 and 50% dilutions. The scales at the bottom represent the colour coding for the 25 and 50% mixtures, respectively. The numbering in each scale indicates the lowest value for each colour, i.e. 11 represents 11–20

### Programmable base editing of a
- T to G
- C in genomic DNA without DNA cleavage [^114BZ9Lb]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of transitions from C•G to T•A base pairs, which account for half of known pathogenic point mutations in humans. The ability to efficiently convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with previous base editors, ABEs enable the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.

### Nelarabine (Arranon) [^1137CPQK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Distribution: Nelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body. For nelarabine, VSSvalues were 197 ± 216 L/m2in adult patients. For ara-G, VSS/F values were 50 ± 24 L/m2in adult patients.

Nelarabine and ara-G are not substantially bound to human plasma proteins (< 25%) in vitro, and binding is independent of nelarabine or ara-G concentrations up to 600 μM.

Metabolism: The principal route of metabolism for nelarabine is O-demethylation by ADA to form ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolyzed to form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form xanthine, which is further oxidized to yield uric acid.

Excretion: Nelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated by the kidneys. Mean urinary excretion of nelarabine and ara-G was 6.6 ± 4.7% and 27 ± 15% of the administered dose, respectively, in 28 adult patients over the 24 hours after nelarabine infusion on Day 1. Renal clearance averaged 24 ± 23 L/h for nelarabine and 6.2 ± 5.0 L/h for ara-G in 21 adult patients. Combined Phase I pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 199 to 2900 mg/m2(n = 66 adult patients) indicate that the mean clearance (CL) of nelarabine is 197 ± 189 L/h/m2on Day 1. The apparent clearance of ara-G (CL/F) is 10.5 ± 4.5 L/h/m2on Day 1. Nelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a mean half-life of 18 minutes and 3.2 hours, respectively, in adult patients.

### Crystal structure of rac1 in complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange region of tiam1 [^113Sz3D6]. Nature (2000). Excellent credibility.

The principal guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family G proteins contain tandem Dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains that catalyse nucleotide exchange and the activation of G proteins. Here we have determined the crystal structure of the DH and PH domains of the T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis factor 1 (Tiam1) protein in complex with its cognate Rho family G protein, Rac1. The two switch regions of Rac1 are stabilized in conformations that disrupt both magnesium binding and guanine nucleotide interaction. The resulting cleft in Rac1 is devoid of nucleotide and highly exposed to solvent. The PH domain of Tiam1 does not contact Rac1, and the position and orientation of the PH domain is markedly altered relative to the structure of the uncomplexed, GTPase-free DH/PH element from Sos1. The Tiam1/Rac1 structure highlights the interactions that catalyse nucleotide exchange on Rho family G proteins, and illustrates structural determinants dictating specificity between individual Rho family members and their associated Dbl-related guanine nucleotide exchange factors.

### Allosteric regulation of glycogen breakdown by the second messenger cyclic di-GMP [^111eKoJ3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The c-di-GMP molecules, bound at each end of the GlgX molecule, make contacts to GlgX residues 31–51 from the N-domain of one GlgX subunit and residues 430–437 and 628–638 from the Central and C-domain of the other GlgX subunit (Fig. 5a, b). Residues in the GlgX N-domain provide most of the base specifying contacts with the c-di-GMP. In particular, the N1 and N2 atoms of one guanine base are contacted by the side chain of Glu47 while the side chain of Arg56 makes a hydrogen bond with the O6 atom of the guanine (Fig. 5b). Cation-π interactions to this guanine base are provided by Arg31 and Arg49. Specifying contacts to the other guanine base are primarily from GlgX main chain atoms. The carbonyl oxygen of Thr51 hydrogen bonds with the guanine N1 atom and the Thr51 amide nitrogen contacts the guanine O6 atom (Fig. 5b). There are also two hydrogen bonds from residues in the Central domain of the other subunit to this guanine base; the main chain amide nitrogen of Gly436 hydrogen bonds to the guanine N2, while the side chain of Arg438 hydrogen bonds with the O6 atom of the guanine and also stacks with the guanine base along with the side chain of Arg579 (Fig. 5b). The two c-di-GMP phosphates are contacted from the side chains of Ser629 and Gln433. Notably, the observed c-di-GMP contacts in our structure are consistent with our biochemical data showing that the RETD 49–52 motif participates in c-di-GMP binding. The collective interactions from GlgX completely specify each of the guanine bases and would select against binding c-di-AMP.

### Genomic heterogeneity of multiple synchronous lung cancer [^116z3NPx]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

APOBEC mutation signature analysis

APOBEC mutation signatures were analysed as previously described. In brief, APOBEC signature enrichment E TCW in relation to the strength of mutagenesis at the T C W motif (where W is either A or T) was calculated as in equation (1):

where mutations TCW is the number of mutated cytosines (and guanines) in a T C W (or W G A) motif, mutations CorG is the total number of mutated cytosines (or guanines), context TCW is the total number of TCW (or WGA) motifs within a 41-nucleotide region centred on the mutated cytosines (and guanines) and context CorG is the total number of cytosines (or guanines) within the 41-nucleotide region centred on the mutated cytosines (or guanines). Only the following substitutions were included in the analysis: T C W to T T W or T G W and W G A to W A A or W C A. Overrepresentation of the APOBEC mutation signature was determined using a two-sided Fisher's exact test comparing the ratio of cytosine-to-thymine or cytosine-to-guanine substitutions with guanine-to-adenine or guanine-to-cytosine substitutions that occurred in and out of the APOBEC target motif (T C W or W G A) to an analogous ratio for all cytosines and guanines inside and outside the T C W or W G A motif within the 41-nucleotide region centred on the mutated cytosine or guanine.

Statistical analyses

Analysis of variance was used to assess the association between mutation burden and the gender or smoking status of each patient. The Pearson product–moment correlation test was used to assess the association between mutation burden and each patient's age or tumour size. The Fisher's exact test was used to assess the significance of differences in mutation spectra between different tumours, and the Pearson product–moment correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between the mutation spectra of different tumours. The Fisher's exact test was also used to compare the incidences of EGFR p.L858R in our cohort and the Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cohort. To determine the correlation of SCNA profiles between different tumours from the same patients, we processed segmented data using the Bioconductor CNTools software package to generate a gene-by-tumour-region copy number matrix. Correlations between different tumours were then calculated to obtain correlation coefficients.

### Probiotic supplementation reduces a biomarker for increased risk of liver cancer in young men from Southern China [^1144d7Ao]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that selected strains of probiotic bacteria can form tight complexes with aflatoxin B(1) and other carcinogens.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to determine whether administration of probiotic bacteria could block the intestinal absorption of aflatoxin B(1) and thereby lead to reduced urinary excretion of aflatoxin B(1)-N(7)-guanine (AFB-N(7)-guanine), a marker for a biologically effective dose of aflatoxin exposure. Elevated urinary excretion of this aflatoxin-DNA adduct is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.

Design

Ninety healthy young men from Guangzhou, China, were randomly assigned to 2 groups; one group received a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LC705 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii strains 2 times/d for 5 wk, and the other group received a placebo preparation. The subjects provided 4 urine samples: at baseline, at 3 and 5 wk after starting the supplementation, and at the end of the 5-wk postintervention period.

Results

The percentage of samples with negative AFB-N(7)-guanine values tended to be higher in the probiotic group than in the placebo group during the 5-wk intervention period (odds ratio: 2.63, P = 0.052), and a statistically significant decrease in the concentration of urinary AFB-N(7)-guanine was observed in the probiotic group. The reduction was 36% at week 3 and 55% at week 5. The geometric means for the probiotic and placebo groups were 0.24 and 0.49 ng AFB-N(7)-guanine/mL, respectively, during the intervention period (P = 0.005).

Conclusion

A probiotic supplement reduces the biologically effective dose of aflatoxin exposure and may thereby offer an effective dietary approach to decrease the risk of liver cancer.

### Guanine nucleotides drive ribosome biogenesis and glycolytic reprogramming in acute myeloid leukemia stem cells [^113aHkw7]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a major clinical obstacle, particularly due to the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) capable of metabolic adaptation. While venetoclax (Ven) inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), we found that Ven-resistant LSCs undergo glycolytic reprogramming to bypass OXPHOS inhibition. This metabolic shift is supported by enhanced ribosome biogenesis, sustained by upregulated de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. Abundant guanine nucleotides suppress the impaired ribosome biogenesis checkpoint (IRBC), leading to TP53 destabilization and persistent MYC expression. Inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenases (IMPDH1/2) depletes guanine nucleotides, activates IRBC, stabilizes TP53, represses MYC, and impairs the metabolic shift to glycolysis. This metabolic rewiring disrupts LSC stemness and suppresses the reconstitution of human AML cells in xenotransplantation experiments. Notably, the suppression of LSC stemness was observed regardless of Ven resistance or the TP53 mutational status of AML cells. These findings reveal that mutation-independent TP53 inactivation is involved in resistant AML and suggest that targeting guanine nucleotide biosynthesis may offer a clinically actionable strategy to eradicate therapy-resistant LSCs.

### Multivariate prediction of motor diagnosis in Huntington's disease: 12 years of PREDICT-HD [^114Y4xjG]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is well known in Huntington's disease that cytosine-adenine-guanine expansion and age at study entry are predictive of the timing of motor diagnosis. The goal of this study was to assess whether additional motor, imaging, cognitive, functional, psychiatric, and demographic variables measured at study entry increased the ability to predict the risk of motor diagnosis over 12 years.

Methods

One thousand seventy-eight Huntington's disease gene-expanded carriers (64% female) from the Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington's Disease study were followed up for up to 12 y (mean = 5, standard deviation = 3.3) covering 2002 to 2014. No one had a motor diagnosis at study entry, but 225 (21%) carriers prospectively received a motor diagnosis. Analysis was performed with random survival forests, which is a machine learning method for right-censored data.

Results

Adding 34 variables along with cytosine-adenine-guanine and age substantially increased predictive accuracy relative to cytosine-adenine-guanine and age alone. Adding six of the common motor and cognitive variables (total motor score, diagnostic confidence level, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, three Stroop tests) resulted in lower predictive accuracy than the full set, but still had twice the 5-y predictive accuracy than when using cytosine-adenine-guanine and age alone. Additional analysis suggested interactions and nonlinear effects that were characterized in a post hoc Cox regression model.

Conclusions

Measurement of clinical variables can substantially increase the accuracy of predicting motor diagnosis over and above cytosine-adenine-guanine and age (and their interaction). Estimated probabilities can be used to characterize progression level and aid in future studies' sample selection.

### The somatic autosomal mutation matrix in cancer genomes [^112siPpf]. Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

An early investigation examined the effect of neighboring nucleotides on mutation frequencies in human germline exonic mutations (Krawczak et al.), and determined that nucleotides two positions upstream of the mutation site were capable of exerting a significant effect on both mutation type and frequency. Activation-induced deaminase (AID) is known to cause cytosine mutations at WR C motifs (W is a weak acid, A or T, and R is a purine), suggesting that the nucleotide two bases upstream of the mutation site is important (Carpenter et al.). An examination of inherited mutations from reconstructed ancestral states identified 3.5- and 3.3-fold excesses of T → C transitions at the second position of A T TG and A T AG motifs, respectively, and a 3.4-fold excess of A → C transversions at the first position of A CAA motifs (Panchin et al.). Likewise, we have previously reported that in melanoma guanines at G RA motifs undergo ~twofold more frequent substitutions than guanines at G R(C|T|G) motifs (Bacolla et al.). Finally, SBSs along mononucleotide repeats are often heavily influenced by long-range interactions caused by charge transfer mechanisms along the DNA (Bacolla et al.).

### The role of MGMT testing in clinical practice: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^114diCoi]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

MGMT epigenetic regulation and temozolomide response — MGMT expression is heavily regulated by methylation-dependent epigenetic silencing, and methylation occurs primarily in CpG islands that are short (typically 300 to 3000 bp) stretches of CG-rich DNA in promoter regions. In cancer, methylation can be globally distorted with overall loss of DNA methylation but aberrant hypermethylation at specific promoters, enhancing tumor growth and survival through inactivation of tumor suppressor, DNA repair, and proapoptotic genes. The DNA repair enzyme MGMT restores normal guanine by transferring the methyl group to a cysteine residue of MGMT, so MGMT activity rescues cells from damage induced by TMZ and leads to resistance, whereas gliomas with inactivation of MGMT are less capable of repairing DNA and show increased sensitivity to alkylating chemotherapy.

### Characterization of the guanine-N7 methyltransferase activity of coronavirus nsp14 on nucleotide GTP [^116EN1Y8]. Virus Research (2013). Low credibility.

Most eukaryotic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including coronaviruses, have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. In our previous work, the nonstructural protein (nsp) 14 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as a cap (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase). In this study, we found that GTP, dGTP as well as cap analogs GpppG, GpppA and m7GpppG could be methylated by SARS-CoV nsp14. In contrast, the nsp14 could not modify ATP, CTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, dUTP or cap analog m7GpppA. Critical residues of nsp14 essential for the methyltransferase activity on GTP were identified, which include F73, R84, W86, R310, D331, G333, P335, Y368, C414, and C416. We further showed that the methyltransferase activity of GTP was universal for nsp14 of other coronaviruses. Moreover, the accumulation of m7GTP or presence of protein nsp14 could interfere with protein translation of cellular mRNAs. Altogether, the results revealed a new enzymatic activity of coronavirus nsp14.

### Guanine nucleotide biosynthesis blockade impairs MLL complex formation and sensitizes leukemias to menin inhibition [^11783ig6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Targeting the dependency of MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemias on menin with small molecule inhibitors has opened new therapeutic strategies for these poor-prognosis diseases. However, the rapid development of menin inhibitor resistance calls for combinatory strategies to improve responses and prevent resistance. Here we show that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) of MLLr acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibit enhanced guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, the inhibition of which leads to myeloid differentiation and sensitization to menin inhibitors. Mechanistically, targeting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) reduces guanine nucleotides and rRNA transcription, leading to reduced protein expression of LEDGF and menin. Consequently, the formation and chromatin binding of the MLL-fusion complex is impaired, reducing the expression of MLL target genes. Inhibition of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis or rRNA transcription further suppresses MLLr AML when combined with a menin inhibitor. Our findings underscore the requirement of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis in maintaining the function of the LEDGF/menin/MLL-fusion complex and provide a rationale to target guanine nucleotide biosynthesis to sensitize MLLr leukemias to menin inhibitors.

### A guanine-flipping and sequestration mechanism for G-quadruplex unwinding by recQ helicases [^116rspir]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In this study, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the RecQ helicase from Cronobacter sakazakii (CsRecQ) bound to a resolved G4 DNA. Surprisingly, the 3′-most guanine base, which is the first base in the quadruplex that the 3′–5′ translocating RecQ would encounter, is bound in a guanine-specific pocket (GSP) in the helicase core. Residues within the GSP satisfy all of the hydrogen bonds that are normally formed by guanines within G-quartet structures, which highlights the remarkable guanine selectivity of the binding site. Guanine docking within the GSP is incompatible with a folded G4 structure, implying that the base must flip from the quartet to be sequestered within the GSP. Consistent with an important and selective role for the GSP in G4 unwinding, changes to the guanine-coordinating residues in RecQ block G4 DNA unwinding but do not alter duplex DNA unwinding. These data lead to a guanine-flipping and sequestration model of G4 unwinding by RecQ helicases that may also be shared with other G4 unwinding helicases.

### Mitomycin (Mitosol) [^113upoBt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Mitosol®inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of mitomycin-induced cross-linking. Cellular RNA and protein synthesis may also be suppressed.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The systemic exposure of mitomycin following ocular administration of Mitosol®in humans is unknown. Based on a comparison of the proposed dose of up to 0.2 mg to intravenous (IV) doses of mitomycin used clinically for treatment of oncologic indications (up to 20 mg/m2), systemic concentrations in humans upon ocular administration are expected to be multiple orders of magnitude lower than those achieved by IV administration.

Elimination

Metabolism

In humans, mitomycin is cleared from ophthalmic tissue after intraoperative topical application and irrigation, as metabolism occurs in other affected tissues. Systemic clearance is affected primarily by metabolism in the liver. The rate of clearance is inversely proportional to the maximal serum concentration because of saturation of the degradative pathways.

Excretion

Approximately 10% of an injectable dose of mitomycin is excreted unchanged in the urine. Since metabolic pathways are saturated at relatively low doses, the percent of a dose excreted in urine increases.

### Understanding the structural and dynamic consequences of DNA epigenetic modifications: computational insights into cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation [^117Eafjf]. Epigenetics (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 3.
Frequency of values for the base step parameters for the unmethylated DD structure, and for the structure methylated at the 3rd and 9th position (3-DNA). The base step values for the 5′and 3′termini are not shown. Due to space constraints on the figure, the 5-mC modification is represented by just the lowercase letter c. The shift, slide and rise parameters are presented in Ångström, and the tilt, roll and twist in degrees. The average values are depicted by the dotted lines. The corresponding average values for each parameter and their standard deviations are present in Table S4.

The central A-T regions (AA/TT, AT-AT, TT-AA) are almost identical in every parameter, between all structures. They display a smaller range of values than any of the other bp steps, meaning that they only sample a limited region of conformational space, in accordance to the stiffness previously reported for TA bps. However, there are differences in the steps flanking the modified base pair compared to the same bases in the WT. This is specifically seen in the twist parameter for the 3-DNA structure (Fig. S1, Table S2), which defines the overall flexibility of the oligomer, and is associated with the winding/unwinding of the helix. The methylated structure displays an average twist value that is ∼3° lower for the 5-mCG-GC and CG-5-mCG steps comparing to the corresponding steps in the unmethylated structure. This local unwinding has been reported for other modified bases, e.g. in 2 crystal structures with N6-methylated adenine residues, these bps were unwound by roughly 2° in comparison to the unmodified DNA or in O6-alkylated guanine lesions, the guanine dimers showed strong unwinding (5 to 6°). For the 9-DNA structure (Fig. S2, Table S3), we observe a smaller variation in the twist value. However, there is a ∼2–3° difference in the roll for the GA-T5-mC and T5-mC-GA steps. The 3,9-DNA structure (Fig. 3, Table S4) presents differences in both the twist and roll angles. It presents similar differences to the sum of the 3-DNA and the 9-DNA structures, but also shows ∼2 to 3° differences in the roll of the G5-mC-5-mCG steps and differences of ∼2 to 3° in the tilt for the GA-T5-mC and T5-mC-GA.

### DNA methylation 101: what is important to know about DNA methylation and its role in SLE risk and disease heterogeneity [^116XEMnt]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DNA methylation

DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group is added to the fifth carbon of cytosine residues that are linked by a phosphate to a guanine nucleotide (a CpG dinucleotide) by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B). This addition forms 5-methylcytosine (figure 1). The methyl group is obtained from the methyl donor S adenosine methionine (SAM). SAM levels are influenced by dietary intake of vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B12 and pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6). CpG dinucleotides are methylated in a tissue and cell-type-specific manner, and their methylation critically influences cell differentiation and tissue development.

Figure 1
DNA methylation and demethylation. Representation of DNA methylation: The addition of a methyl group at the fifth carbon position of the cytosine base. This process is mediated by the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzyme family. DNA demethylation is mediated by the ten eleven translocation (TET) enzyme family. Active demethylation is a sequential process in which 5-methylcytosine is converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), which is converted to 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and finally 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC). This process readies the sites for thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) to remove both 5-fC and 5-caC.

### Structural basis for removal of adenine mispaired with 8-oxoguanine by mutY adenine DNA glycosylase [^117Ag9ns]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

The genomes of aerobic organisms suffer chronic oxidation of guanine to the genotoxic product 8-oxoguanine (oxoG). Replicative DNA polymerases misread oxoG residues and insert adenine instead of cytosine opposite the oxidized base. Both bases in the resulting A*oxoG mispair are mutagenic lesions, and both must undergo base-specific replacement to restore the original C*G pair. Doing so represents a formidable challenge to the DNA repair machinery, because adenine makes up roughly 25% of the bases in most genomes. The evolutionarily conserved enzyme adenine DNA glycosylase (called MutY in bacteria and hMYH in humans) initiates repair of A*oxoG to C*G by removing the inappropriately paired adenine base from the DNA backbone. A central issue concerning MutY function is the mechanism by which A*oxoG mispairs are targeted among the vast excess of A*T pairs. Here we report the use of disulphide crosslinking to obtain high-resolution crystal structures of MutY-DNA lesion-recognition complexes. These structures reveal the basis for recognizing both lesions in the A*oxoG pair and for catalysing removal of the adenine base.

### African swine fever virus vaccine strain asfv-G-∆ I177l reverts to virulence and negatively affects reproductive performance [^1133RvxG]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

To get a complete picture of the changes that occurred during passaging, these regions were PCR amplified, including all the longer poly G/C stretches, from viruses of each passage, and sequenced the amplicons (Fig. S1). Comparing the size of the poly G/C stretches of the passaged viruses with that of the P0 virus showed that they occasionally diverged 1–2 nucleotides in the different passages but without an obvious direction (Table S8). Mutations or polymorphisms were not detected in the transgenic region, demonstrating that the sequence of the transgene (mCherry regulated by the p72 promoter) remained stable throughout the passages (Table S12). The B385R ORF exhibited a polymorphic nucleotide at position 104908 (cytosine/thymine) in passages 2 and 3 but reverted to its original cytosine form and became homogenous again in passage 4 (Tables S11, S12).

The only changes showing some successions were detected in three separate nucleotide positions in the C257L gene. At position 86868, cytosine became polymorphic (cytosine/thymine) in passages 2 and 3, and subsequently changed to thymine in passage 4, resulting in an amino acid change from glutamic acid to lysine. The C257L ORF contains a homopolymer stretch of seven thymine residues at nucleotide position 87231–87237, which was reduced to four thymines in passage 4, causing a deletion of one lysine residue in the C257L protein. At position 87086, guanine exhibited polymorphism (guanine/adenine) in passages 3 and 4. In the late passages, the transition from guanine to adenine resulted in an alanine to valine amino acid substitution (Tables S11, S12, Fig. 3). NGS sequencing of the full genome of passage 4 virus confirmed the sequencing results of the PCR amplicons, and no other additional mutations were found in the virus genome. To determine the relative position of the three SNPs in the virus quasispecies, the C257L gene was PCR amplified and cloned. From the resulting clones, 5 were sequenced. Four out of the five clones carried the C86868T and the three thymine deletions at position 87231–87237 in combination, while the remaining clone carried only the latter, and the adenine mutation at position 87086 could not be detected in any of the clones.

### The impact of selection at the amino acid level on the usage of synonymous codons [^113wXARN]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

There are two main forces that affect usage of synonymous codons: directional mutational pressure and selection. The effectiveness of protein translation is usually considered as the main selectional factor. However, biased codon usage can also be a byproduct of a general selection at the amino acid level interacting with nucleotide replacements. To evaluate the validity and strength of such an effect, we superimposed > 3.5 billion unrestricted mutational processes on the selection of nonsynonymous substitutions based on the differences in physicochemical properties of the coded amino acids. Using a modified evolutionary optimization algorithm, we determined the conditions in which the effect on the relative codon usage is maximized. We found that the effect is enhanced by mutational processes generating more adenine and thymine than guanine and cytosine, as well as more purines than pyrimidines. Interestingly, this effect is observed only under an unrestricted model of nucleotide substitution, and disappears when the mutational process is time-reversible. Comparison of the simulation results with data for real protein coding sequences indicates that the impact of selection at the amino acid level on synonymous codon usage cannot be neglected. Furthermore, it can considerably interfere, especially in AT-rich genomes, with other selections on codon usage, e.g., translational efficiency. It may also lead to difficulties in the recognition of other effects influencing codon bias, and an overestimation of protein coding sequences whose codon usage is subjected to adaptational selection.

(1) Thymine demethylation or UTP insertion, among other processes, may generate a genomic A–U base pair. The uracil can be removed by UNG (uracil DNA glycosylase, UDG) to generate a gapped repair intermediate. (2) The resulting gapped intermediate may undergo gap-filling by DNA polymerases and insertion of TTP or 8-oxo-rGTP opposite A to yield the Watson-crick (A–T) or A–G ro base pairs. Pols δ and ε are effectively unable to insert 8-oxo-rGTP and would likely not generate cytotoxic A–G ro intermediates. (3) MutYH-dependent repair of G o lesions can efficiently remove A opposite G o, however, this pathway inefficiently excises A opposite G ro and therefore likely does not participate in repair of A–G ro base pairs. (4) OGG1 can remove G o opposite C from C–G o lesions, but is inefficient in removing G ro opposite C, so this pathway is unlikely to operate in repair of C–G ro lesions. These pathways promote buildup of G ro containing lesions that are potentially more cytotoxic than G o lesions and may lead to unrepaired genomic instability.

Enrichment of genomic sequences at preferred cfDNA fragment end positions

We investigated the frequency and composition of cfDNA start and end sequences, as these have been previously described as non-random and potentially related to cleavage by endogenous DNAses –. To rigorously identify cfDNA end positions, we pooled cfDNA sequence data from low-coverage whole-genome sequencing from a cohort of healthy individuals (n = 543) and investigated the frequency of cfDNA breakpoints at every evaluable position in the genome. We only considered fragment reads with high sequence and mapping quality and calculated the ratio of the number of cfDNA fragments starting or ending at a particular position compared to the number of fragments with start or end positions within 50 bp surrounding that location. We used this approach to account for differences in cfDNA fragment size, coverage across the genome, and local copy number polymorphisms, as well as to identify "preferred" fragment end positions which we defined as genomic locations with a higher number of fragment ends than would be expected by random fragmentation (see "Methods" section).

We evaluated cfDNA fragments with more frequently observed end-positions and found that these were enriched for specific motifs. These typically included a thymine or an adenine before the start of the cfDNA fragment and two cytosines (A/T|CC) or a cytosine followed by a guanine (A/T|CG) as the first two nucleotides of the cfDNA fragment (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). We reasoned that end sequences that occurred recurrently among cfDNA fragments would likely represent those locations protected by nucleosome occupancy, and found that the frequency of these base motifs increased further at preferred recurrent ends among healthy individuals (Fig. 1a, b). A/T|CC and A/T|CG preferred cfDNA fragment ends were observed at rates much higher than theoretically expected in the genome (26.5x for A/T|CC and 5.5x for A/T|CG) (Fig. 1a; p < 0.0001, t -test), while the frequencies of DNA ends from fragments generated through sonication of genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines were close to theoretical abundances. Consistent with the observations above, the genome-wide locations of preferred cfDNA ends were observed to be higher in the first exons of genes, regions known to have highly ordered nucleosomes, and lower in the remaining gene bodies, which are more likely to contain less consistent nucleosome structures (Fig. 1c).

### Dynamic basis for dG
- dT misincorporation via tautomerization and ionization [^114yC8xy]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Tautomeric and anionic Watson-Crick-like mismatches have important roles in replication and translation errors through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion, we resolve a sequence-dependent kinetic network connecting G•T/U wobbles with three distinct Watson-Crick mismatches: two rapidly exchanging tautomeric species (G enol
- T/UG•T enol /U enol; population less than 0.4%) and one anionic species (G•T - /U -; population around 0.001% at neutral pH). The sequence-dependent tautomerization or ionization step was inserted into a minimal kinetic mechanism for correct incorporation during replication after the initial binding of the nucleotide, leading to accurate predictions of the probability of dG•dT misincorporation across different polymerases and pH conditions and for a chemically modified nucleotide, and providing mechanisms for sequence-dependent misincorporation. Our results indicate that the energetic penalty for tautomerization and/or ionization accounts for an approximately 10–2 to 10–3 -fold discrimination against misincorporation, which proceeds primarily via tautomeric dG enol
- dT and dG•dT enol, with contributions from anionic dG•dT - dominant at pH 8.4 and above or for some mutagenic nucleotides.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^116jEGSh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fragile X syndrome — Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, occurs in approximately 1 in 3,600 males and 1 in 4,000–6,000 females, and is transmitted as an X-linked disorder. The cause is expansion of a cytosine–guanine–guanine repeat in the FMR1 gene, with repeat-size categories classified as unaffected (5–44 repeats), intermediate (45–54 repeats), premutation (55–200 repeats), and full mutation (greater than 200 repeats). A person with 55–200 repeats does not have features of fragile X syndrome but is at increased risk of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and FMR1-related premature ovarian failure, whereas with more than 200 repeats an individual has a full mutation with full expression in males and variable expression in females; the large number of repeats in a full mutation allele causes the FMR1 gene to become methylated and inactivated. Fragile X syndrome is a common known cause of autism or autism spectrum disorder behaviors with intellectual disability, with the diagnosis occurring in approximately 25% of affected individuals. Transmission of a disease-producing mutation depends on the sex of the parent and the number of repeats, with repeats very rarely expanding during spermatogenesis such that only an affected male can transmit the full mutation to his female offspring, whereas repeats in females may expand during oogenesis such that women with the premutation may transmit a full mutation resulting in an affected child.

### Development of deaminase-free T-to-S base editor and C-to-G base editor by engineered human uracil DNA glycosylase [^112bABFf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Base editors enable single-nucleotide edits with high precision and efficiency, providing powerful tools for the fields of life science and medicine. Two categories of DNA base editors, deaminase-based base editor (dBE) and deaminase-free glycosylase-based base editor (gBE), have been developed to date. The dBEs perform base editing using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) deaminase enzymes, such as the evolved tRNA adenosine deaminase TadA, AID/APOBEC-like cytidine deaminase and double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A (DddA) variants. The deamination of A or C as an essential step is required for all dBEs, including adenine base editor (ABE), cytosine base editor (CBE), DddA-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE), and their derivatives (e.g. A&C-BEmax, AYBE, AXBE/ACBEand CGBEs –). Recently, we have developed a gBE enabling direct G editing (i.e. deaminase-free glycosylase-based guanine base editor, gGBE), based on engineered human N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG; also known as alkyladenine DNA glycosylase, AAG). So far, dBEs and gGBE could enable editing of adenine (A), cytosine (C), or guanine (G), but no base editor for thymine (T) editing is available now. Base conversion by deamination is impossible for T (due to the absence of amine), making the development of thymine base editor still challenged.

Here, we develop a deaminase-free glycosylase-based thymine base editor (gTBE) as well as a deaminase-free glycosylase-based cytosine base editor (gCBE), to achieve orthogonal base editing, that is, gTBE for direct T editing and gCBE for direct C editing, respectively. After several rounds of mutagenesis of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG, or UDG) moieties, we obtain marked enhancement of editing activity for T editing and C editing, as compared with that obtained by wild-type (WT) UNG variant. We characterize the editing profile of gTBE and gCBE by targeting dozens of endogenous genomic loci in cultured mammalian cells as well as mouse embryos, demonstrating their high base editing efficiency.

### Thiotepa (Tepadina) [^1113u9SG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship for efficacy and safety has not been characterized.

### Multidimensional third-generation sequencing of modified DNA bases allows interrogation of complex biological systems [^114z6vK8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We next examined the reads for direct signatures of O6mG residues. Using values from our synthesized training libraries, we identified a read with a likely O6mG current value (Fig. 6f). This read also had a hairpin oligonucleotide, which we had added during the adapter ligation step of the sequencing library generation, successfully ligated, covalently linking both strands of DNA and returning sequencing data for both strands. BrdU signatures were detected in only a single strand of this read; consistent with a read that had replicated during the experimental period (Fig. 6g). Additionally, methylation analysis confirmed that this read originated from a methylated promoter (Fig. 6h). At one specific position within this read, we detected a current inconsistent with the expected G reference (Fig. 6i). This current value was six standard deviations above the reference mean for a dG, and almost 3 standard deviations above the dA reference. However, it was closely aligned (within one s.d.) with our O6mG data (Fig. 6j). At the corresponding position on the opposite strand, the current was more consistent with a dT than a dC, suggesting this read contains an O6mG mispaired to a dT (Fig. 6k). Finally, we also examined reads for signatures of abasic sites generated by our training library, as a marker of possible nucleotide excision repair, but no such currents were detected. Thus, in this experiment we extracted seven dimensions of information: (1) genetic sequence to confirm the read originated from the MGMT promoter, (2) epigenetic status of the promoter through CpG methylation, (3) active changes in the epigenetic status through CpG hydroxymethylation, (4) the proliferation status of the cell the read originated from through BrdU incorporation, (5) the direct effects of the alkylating agent through O6mG, (6) the indirect effects of the alkylating agent through the opposite-strand mispairing with dT, and (7) any signature of nucleotide excision repair through detection of abasic sites.

Interacting polar residues of cPPR-Telo1 and adenine (A), thymine (T) and guanine (G) are shown as sticks. Hydrogen bonds are shown with dashes and distances in Å are indicated

In the case of uracil recognition in PPR-RNA complexes, the amide group of the asparagine side chain at position 5 donates a hydrogen bond to the O2 of the pyrimidine ring, while the carboxyl group of the aspartate makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the N3 of the pyrimidine. An identical mode of thymine recognition is seen in our structure when ssDNA is bound and the methyl group at position C5 that distinguishes uracil and thymine is orientated away from the protein (Fig. 4a–c), such that it is initially hard to predict why poly(T) ssDNA is bound much less efficiently than poly(U) RNA, based on this difference. However, the C5 methyl groups likely alter the hydration pattern of the backbone and could also alter the stacking energies between bases, and thereby affect the dynamics of the RNA–protein interaction. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that although the electron density is very clear for all nucleotides, it is weaker for one of the thymines (T7) in the structure (Supplementary Fig. 9). T7 sits adjacent to another thymine (T8) and the altered stacking energy between these bases might contribute to the observed flexibility at that position. Although tolerated well, or to some extent, when there is an isolated thymine or a pair of thymines in the ssDNA target, respectively, it could be that the additive disruption in stacking energies causes poly(T) tracts to bind poorly to cPPR proteins (as seen in Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2).

### Intragenic DNA methylation: implications of this epigenetic mechanism for cancer research [^113ku2F3]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Epigenetics is the study of all mechanisms that regulate gene transcription and genome stability that are maintained throughout the cell division, but do not include the DNA sequence itself. The best-studied epigenetic mechanism to date is DNA methylation, where methyl groups are added to the cytosine base within cytosine–guanine dinucleotides (CpG sites). CpGs are frequently clustered in high density (CpG islands (CGIs)) at the promoter of over half of all genes. Current knowledge of transcriptional regulation by DNA methylation centres on its role at the promoter where unmethylated CGIs are present at most actively transcribed genes, whereas hypermethylation of the promoter results in gene repression. Over the last 5 years, research has gradually incorporated a broader understanding that methylation patterns across the gene (so-called intragenic or gene body methylation) may have a role in transcriptional regulation and efficiency. Numerous genome-wide DNA methylation profiling studies now support this notion, although whether DNA methylation patterns are a cause or consequence of other regulatory mechanisms is not yet clear. This review will examine the evidence for the function of intragenic methylation in gene transcription, and discuss the significance of this in carcinogenesis and for the future use of therapies targeted against DNA methylation.

### Quantitative real-time PCR assisted cell counting (qPACC) for epigenetic-based immune cell quantification in blood and tissue [^115CXyFY]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

A novel form of immune cell quantification in blood and tissue is described using epigenetic - based, quantitative real-time PCR assisted cell counting (qPACC). The methylation status of the chromatin structure of either actively expressed or silenced genes is the basis of the epigenetic-based cell identification and quantification technology. Discovery of cell type specific removal of methyl groups (demethylation) from the 5'-carbon of the cytosine base in the dinucleotide cytosine phosphate guanine permits precise and robust quantification of immune cells from only small amounts of human blood or tissue samples. These epigenetic biomarkers located on genomic DNA are stably associated with a cell type of interest.

### Oxidatively-induced DNA base damage and base excision repair abnormalities in siblings of individuals with bipolar disorder DNA damage and repair in bipolar disorder [^113wNHhA]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mood disorder that often co-occurs with various medical illnesses and is associated with premature aging, resulting in a shortened life expectancy. Mounting evidence suggests that individuals with BD have elevated levels of oxidatively-induced DNA damage. DNA is a highly susceptible molecule to oxidative insults, and it is estimated that every single cell of the human body is exposed to up to a million DNA lesions. Nevertheless, these damages are repaired by the cellular DNA repair machinery, which includes the base excision repair (BER). However, an overload of oxidative insults or insufficient repair can lead to persistent DNA damage, genomic instability, and ultimately, premature aging and the development of various illnesses. Therefore, oxidatively-induced DNA damage and abnormal DNA repair mechanisms have been suggested to play a crucial role in the shared pathophysiology among BD, increased cellular aging, and comorbidity.

The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) is formed by the attack of the hydroxyl radical at the C8-position of guanine of dG followed by the one-electron oxidation of the OH-adduct radical of guanine. Since guanine is the most susceptible base to oxidation due to its low reduction potential, 8-OH-dG is the most widely used parameter to determine oxidatively-induced DNA damage. Alongside 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua), various purine and pyrimidine base damages such as 8-hydroxyadenine (8-OH-Ade), 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde), 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua), cytosine glycol (Cyt gly), thymine glycol (Thy gly), 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5-OH-MeUra), and 5,6-dihydroxycytosine exist. In contrast to the numerous well-established oxidatively-induced DNA base lesions, earlier research in psychiatric disorders exclusively concentrated on 8-OH-dG. Higher levels of 8-OH-dG were shown in individuals with BD compared to healthy controls (HCs). While some studies found higher levels during manic and depressive episodes, but not during euthymia, others found increased levels during all phases, including euthymia. A meta-analysis suggested that the increase of the 8-OH-dG is more pronounced in the depressive state of BD.

The promoter with maximal activity lies 5′ of the gene from −953 to +202 bp and consists of a minimal promoter (−69 to +19), an enhancer (+143 to +202) that binds MGMT enhancer binding protein, with additional sites such as SP1 and AP1; transcription initiates at a single site within a guanosine-cytosine-rich, non-TATA box — containing promoter.

### Direct detection of 8-oxo-dG using nanopore sequencing [^116zCwyV]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Genomic DNA is under constant oxidative damage, with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) being the prominent lesion linked to mutagenesis, epigenetics, and gene regulation. Existing methods to detect 8-oxo-dG rely on indirect approaches, while nanopore sequencing enables direct detection of base modifications. A model for 8-oxo-dG detection is currently missing due to the lack of training data. Here, we develop a strategy using synthetic oligos to generate long, 8-oxo-dG context-variable DNA molecules for deep learning and nanopore sequencing. Our training approach addresses the rarity of 8-oxo-dG relative to guanine, enabling specific detection. Applied to a tissue culture model of oxidative damage, our method reveals uneven genomic 8-oxo-dG distribution, dissimilar context pattern to C > A mutations, and local 5-mC depletion. This dual measurement of 5-mC and 8-oxo-dG at single-molecule resolution uncovers new insights into their interplay. Our approach also provides a general framework for detecting other rare DNA modifications using synthetic DNA and nanopore sequencing.

### DNA sequence-dependent activity and base flipping mechanisms of DNMT1 regulate genome-wide DNA methylation [^116DRdaS]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Structure of DNMT1 bound to different DNA substrates

Next we asked, if the CpG-flanking sequences of DNA substrates impact the protein-DNA interaction of DNMT1. In this regard, we previously solved the crystal structure of a complex between a C-terminal fragment of mouse DNMT1 (residues 731–1602, mDNMT1 731–1602) and a hemimethylated DNA. Control experiments revealed the same flanking sequence preferences of mDNMT1 731–1602 as those of full-length mDNMT1 (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). The DNA used for crystallization contained a central CpG site where the target cytosine was replaced by 5-fluorocytosine (5fC) (PDB 4DA4). The presence of 5fC in the CpG site permits the formation of a covalent, productive complex between DNMT1 and DNA, which was used for structural characterization. This DNA contained a GG CG GC sequence (GCG complex), which represents a relatively disfavored NNCGNN flank (rank 177 of 256, where rank 1 represents the highest preference). We therefore applied the same approach to obtain the covalent complexes of DNMT1 with two relatively preferable substrates, containing TC CG TA (rank 2, CCG complex) and TA CG GA (rank 32, ACG complex) sequences, respectively (Table 2). We generated the crystals for both complexes under crystallization conditions similar to that used for the GCG complex. The crystal structures of the CCG and ACG DNA complexes of DNMT1, each bound to S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy), an analog of AdoMet, were solved at 3.0 Å and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). Additional attempts to obtain a sufficient amount of the complex between DNMT1 and a highly disfavored CG CG AG sequence (rank 254) (Table 2) for crystallization failed, presumably due to the low affinity of DNMT1 for this sequence and/or low crosslinking yield with 5fC within this highly disfavored DNA sequence.

### Development of deaminase-free T-to-S base editor and C-to-G base editor by engineered human uracil DNA glycosylase [^1141Pjrx]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

DNA base editors enable direct editing of adenine (A), cytosine (C), or guanine (G), but there is no base editor for direct thymine (T) editing currently. Here we develop two deaminase-free glycosylase-based base editors for direct T editing (gTBE) and C editing (gCBE) by fusing Cas9 nickase (nCas9) with engineered human uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) variants. By several rounds of structure-informed rational mutagenesis on UNG in cultured human cells, we obtain gTBE and gCBE with high activity of T-to-S (i.e. T-to-C or T-to-G) and C-to-G conversions, respectively. Furthermore, we conduct parallel comparison of gTBE/gCBE with those recently developed using other protein engineering strategies, and find gTBE/gCBE show the outperformance. Thus, we provide several base editors, gTBEs and gCBEs, with corresponding engineered UNG variants, broadening the targeting scope of base editors.

### The repertoire of mutational signatures in human cancer [^111tABy5]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Several base substitution signatures showed transcriptional strand bias, which may be attributable to transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair acting on DNA damage and/or to an excess of DNA damage on untranscribed strands of genes. Both mechanisms result in more mutations of damaged bases on untranscribed than on transcribed strands of genes. Assuming that either mechanism is responsible for the observed transcriptional strand biases, DNA damage to cytosine (SBS7a and SBS7b), guanine (SBS4, SBS8, SBS19, SBS23, SBS24, SBS31, SBS32, SBS35 and SBS42), thymine (SBS7c, SBS7d, SBS21, SBS26 and SBS33) and adenine (SBS5, SBS12, SBS16, SBS22 and SBS25) may underlie these mutational signatures (plots of strand bias are available at). The likely DNA-damaging agents are known for SBS4 (tobacco mutagens), SBS7a, SBS7b, SBS7c and SBS7d (UV light), SBS22 (aristolochic acid), SBS24 (aflatoxin), SBS25 (chemotherapy), SBS31 and SBS35 (platinum compounds), SBS32 (azathioprine) and SBS42 (haloalkanes).

Using the SBS classification of 1,536 mutation types, which uses the sequence context two bases 5′ and two bases 3′ to each mutated base, yielded signatures that are largely consistent with those based on substitutions in trinucleotide contexts. Notably, however, two forms of both SBS2 and SBS13 were extracted, one with mainly a pyrimidine and the other with mainly a purine at the −2 base (the second base 5′ to the mutated cytosine). These may represent the activities of the cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, respectively. If so, APOBEC3A accounts for many more mutations than APOBEC3B in cancers with high APOBEC activity. Other signatures showed nonrandom sequence contexts at +2 and −2 positions (for example, SBS17a, SBS17b and SBS9), but sequence context effects were generally much stronger for bases immediately 5′ and 3′ to mutated bases.

Results

Epigenetics

In contrast to the term genetics, epigenetics describes changes in gene expression that do not originate from a modification of the DNA nucleotide sequence. Instead, gene regulatory information is stored in the form of biochemical modifications of cytosine bases and histone proteins.

According to current understanding, epigenetic modifications of the chromatin structure take place at the amino acid residues of histone tails, which provide a free surface for potential protein-protein interactions. This regulatory function, inherent in their chemical structure, depends on their abundance.

DNA methylation is a covalent modification of post-replicative DNA that creates a 'fifth base' from cytosine: 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). This modification takes place mainly in parts of the genome known as CpGs, where a cytosine base is followed by a guanine nucleotide. This methylation is catalysed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT).

### DNA interstrand cross-links induced by the major oxidative adenine lesion 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine [^112d8pSq]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Thermal stability analyses of oxoA-G and oxoA-A ICL DNA show that the two cross-links variably stabilize the duplexes, with the oxoA-G ICL displaying higher stability of the duplex than the oxoA-A cross-link (Δ T m = 22.0 vs. 20.0 °C, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 13). This is likely due to the distortion of the helical structure by covalent linkages at variable degrees, thus interrupting hydrogen bond interactions near the cross-link in different ways. Furthermore, this helps explain the observed difference in migration patterns between the oxoA-G and oxoA-A ICLs, as this difference in helical distortion likely results in altered three-dimensional structures.

The published solution structure of G(C2)-G(N2) cross-link-containing duplex DNA (PDB code: 1S9O)provides insights into the three-dimensional structure of our oxoA-G ICL. Nitrous acid generates guanine-guanine ICLs in the 5'-CG/GC-5' sequence context, where an NH moiety is covalently linked to the C2 atoms of the two guanines (Fig. 10a). The chemical structure of the G(C2)-G(N2) cross-link in duplex DNA would be very similar to that of the oxoA-G cross-link (Fig. 10a). In both structures, the C2 atoms of two purines are connected by an NH moiety. These cross-links form in the minor groove of B-form DNA with a similar linkage as the oxoA-G ICL reported here. In addition, in both the 5'-C(oxoA)/GT-5' and the 5'-CG/GC-5' ICLs, the two 3' purines engage in the cross-linking reaction. Furthermore, structural analysis suggests that the distance between N1s of the two guanines in the G(C2)-G(N2) ICL would be similar to that between N1s of the two purines in the oxoA-G ICL: The NMR structure of the G(C2)-G(N2) ICL shows a distance of 2.7 Å for the two guanine N2s, which cannot occur if both guanines are in their major keto tautomers due to repulsive steric interaction. In turn, this suggests that one of the two guanines exists as the minor enol tautomer, which would allow the formation of the observed hydrogen bond between N1s of the guanines. In the case of the oxoA-G ICL, the N1s of oxoA and G can form a hydrogen bond in their major tautomeric conformations (Fig. 10a). The comparison between the oxoA-G and G-G cross-links leads us to propose that the oxoA-G ICL structure would be very similar to the G(C2)-G(N2) ICL structure. Therefore, we built a modeled structure of the oxoA-G ICL with modification of the known G(C2)-G(N2) ICL structure (Fig. 10b–d). As similarly observed in the G(C2)-G(N2) ICL structure, the oxoA-G ICL structure would display a near coplanar oxoA-G cross-link; a widened minor groove near the cross-link; B-DNA-like conformation; favorable stacking interactions among the oxoA-G cross-link and spatially adjacent base pairs; base flipping of the pyrimidines opposite oxoA and the G; and stabilization of the flipped-out pyrimidines via interaction with the widened minor groove.

Hybridization capture target enrichment — The HaloPlex technique uses restriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA followed by hybridization of biotinylated DNA probes designed with homology only to the 5′ and 3′ ends of regions of interest, promoting circularization and increased capture specificity; probe/fragment circular hybrids are then captured on streptavidin-coated beads, ligated, purified, and amplified. Hybridization capture is sensitive to sample base composition, with adenine-thymine rich sequences potentially lost through poor annealing and regions with high guanine-cytosine content potentially lost through secondary structure formation.

### Somatic hypermutation at A.T pairs: polymerase error versus dUTP incorporation [^114jG6KL]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2005). Medium credibility.

Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes occurs at both C.G pairs and A.T pairs. Mutations at C.G pairs are created by activation-induced deaminase (AID)-catalysed deamination of C residues to U residues. Mutations at A.T pairs are probably produced during patch repair of the AID-generated U.G lesion, but they occur through an unknown mechanism. Here, we compare the popular suggestion of nucleotide mispairing through polymerase error with an alternative possibility, mutation through incorporation of dUTP (or another non-canonical nucleotide).

### Lesch-nyhan syndrome presenting as acute renal failure secondary to obstructive uropathy [^113r2qCY]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mental retardation, self-mutilation, choreoathetosis, and hyperuricemia. The disease is caused by a mutation in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene and is transmitted as a sex-linked recessive disorder. Since hyperuricemia is the primary metabolic problem caused by a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mutation, urologic evaluation and treatment is often necessary for children with this disease. We report a 3-year-old boy who presented with anuric renal failure secondary to bilateral obstructing uric acid calculi. The evaluation of T lymphocytes revealed a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mutation consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The diagnosis and urologic management of this disorder is discussed.

### Landscape of adenosine-to-inosine RNA recoding across human tissues [^116aqoTR]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As part of standard sequencing protocols, inosines in the RNA are reverse-transcribed into guanosines in the cDNA. Thus, aligning the sequencing reads to the reference genome, A-to-I editing is manifested as A-to-G genome-read mismatches. Typically, recoding activity is dwarfed by A-to-I editing events at millions of sites within non-coding regions, and is therefore much more difficult to detect (Fig. 1a). As a result, systematic analyses of mismatches yielded high-specificity identification of sites in human. virtually all of them within Alu repeats, but performed poorly in coding regions. The relatively small number of recoding sites, is overshadowed by additional sources of discrepancies between the reads and the reference genome. First, genomic variability between the reference genome and the sampled individuals translates into mismatches between the reference genome and the RNA sequenced from these individuals. Over 500 million human single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified so far, of which almost all are rare. A typical individual genome includes tens of thousands of rare polymorphisms. Matching DNA-seq data could be used to filter out these sites per sample, but it is usually not available. Furthermore, even when available, somatic genomic mutations may result in mismatches misidentified as editing events. Second, systematic misalignment of RNA-seq reads to the wrong (but homologous) genomic locus could lead to an apparently consistent mismatch, to be misidentified as an editing event –. These are common in the CDS as many proteins has closely-related paralogs, polymorphic duplications, and processed pseudogenes. These mapping problems are enhanced by splicing (especially when genomic polymorphisms reside in proximity to canonical splicing junctions). Moreover, each individual genome harbors several megabases of non-canonical segments, which commonly include unique duplications and processed pseudogenes. Chimeric sequences and spontaneous deamination contribute to the observed mismatches as well. Finally, technical sequencing errors are customarily cleaned using the quality score. However, the quality score seems to underestimate the error rate in specific locations such as homopolymeric sequencesor reads' ends, as well as the vicinity of mispriming events by the random hexamer primers. Thus, to date, the low specificity and sensitivity of RNA-editing site detection within the coding sequencehinder global functional analyses and evolutionary studies of recoding in human.

### Whole genome methylation sequencing in blood identifies extensive differential DNA methylation in late-onset dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [^113t7Ubs]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Late‐onset dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is diagnosed by signs and symptoms of dementia that occur at or after the age of 65. While the etiology of AD remains uncertain, recent evidence indicates that environmental influences increase the risk of AD in part through interactions with the epigenome. Covalent addition of a methyl group at position 5 of the nucleotide cytosine generates 5‐methylcytosine (5mC). 5mC participates in coordination of gene expression in the human genome. Fluctuations in 5mC levels across the genome are observed over the lifespan in association with cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Variations in 5mC abundance and distribution have been identified in post mortem brain tissues of AD patients in genes that co‐segregate with AD susceptibility. Recent DNA microarray‐based epigenome‐wide association studies (EWAS) report differential methylation in known and newly recognized AD genes in brain and blood samples, thereby underscoring the value of EWAS in disclosing novel genes and pathways associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Prior single gene‐targeted and microarray‐based studies used diverse DNA methylation detection platforms that query preselected genes and genomic regions, and scan at most only 3.4% of the potential methylated sites in the human genome. A shared limitation of previous contributions is the use of DNA microarray‐based technologies that are limited by a priori, biased choice of targeted loci, rather than use of unbiased, comprehensive methods of DNA methylation analysis using whole genome methylation sequencing (WGMS). As a preferred alternative to microarray‐based methods, WGMS provides single base‐pair resolution of all methylated sites in the linear DNA sequence of bases along the 5′ to 3′ direction in which a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide (CpG) in the human genome. This balanced approach supports evaluation of blood DNA methylation levels as potential molecular biomarkers of AD, and facilitates DNA methylation and multi‐omic investigations with a pragmatic, translational opportunity to improve the diagnosis and individualized treatment of AD.

### Structural basis for human OGG1 processing 8-oxodGuo within nucleosome core particles [^111EouVm]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Genomic DNA is susceptible to damage from both endogenous and exogenous oxidants, leading to the formation of various oxidative lesions. Accumulation of these lesions may have adverse physiological consequences, such as mutagenesis, genomic instability, and cellular senescence. Notably, among these lesions, 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) is highly prevalent and serves as a biomarker of oxidative stress. 8-OxodGuo can form a stable base pair with deoxyadenosine (dA), which results in G → T transversion mutations upon cell division. Additionally, further oxidation of 8-oxodGuo rapidly occurs, generating more mutagenic and harmful lesions such as spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp), guanidinohydantoin (Gh) – and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) –. The deleterious effects of 8-oxodGuo within cells are primarily mitigated through the base excision repair (BER) process. The molecular mechanism of BER for 8-oxodGuo in free double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) has been extensively studied. The BER is initialized by 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), which specifically recognizes and flips the oxidized nucleobase from the DNA duplex, followed by catalysis of the glycosidic bond cleavage.

In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA wraps around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, the fundamental building blocks of chromatin. Initially, the removal of 8-oxodGuo by OGG1 within nucleosomes was thought to be restricted due to steric hindrance imposed by histones and the bend/rigid structure of nucleosome DNA. However, recent studies have challenged this notion, demonstrating that OGG1 can remove nucleosomal 8-oxodGuo –. The efficiency of repair, however, significantly depends on the location and geometric orientation of 8-oxodGuo within the nucleosome –. These findings suggest a coordinated and adaptable interaction between OGG1 and nucleosomes, allowing OGG1 to recognize and process 8-oxodGuo within nucleosomal DNA. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying how OGG1 processes 8-oxodGuo in nucleosomes remains unclear.

### High-throughput single-molecule quantification of individual base stacking energies in nucleic acids [^113z11g3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Base stacking interactions between adjacent bases in DNA and RNA are important for many biological processes and in biotechnology applications. Previous work has estimated stacking energies between pairs of bases, but contributions of individual bases has remained unknown. Here, we use a Centrifuge Force Microscope for high-throughput single molecule experiments to measure stacking energies between adjacent bases. We found stacking energies strongest between purines (G|A at -2.3 ± 0.2kcal/mol) and weakest between pyrimidines (C|T at -0.5 ± 0.1kcal/mol). Hybrid stacking with phosphorylated, methylated, and RNA nucleotides had no measurable effect, but a fluorophore modification reduced stacking energy. We experimentally show that base stacking can influence stability of a DNA nanostructure, modulate kinetics of enzymatic ligation, and assess accuracy of force fields in molecular dynamics simulations. Our results provide insights into fundamental DNA interactions that are critical in biology and can inform design in biotechnology applications.

### Empirical comparison of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and infinium beadChip reproducibility and coverage of DNA methylation in humans [^116B2tmZ]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable gene regulation that is not due to changes in the primary sequence of DNA nucleotides.DNA methylation (DNAm) at cytosine residues in cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides is one of the most studied epigenetic marks; it is relatively easy to measure, critical to the maintenance of cellular identity, and related to chromatin conformation and transcriptional programming. – CpG loci are statistically underrepresented in mammalian genomes, but they are often concentrated in regions known as CpG "islands", and ~60% of known human gene promoters contain CpG islands. Genomic regions 2000 base-pairs (2 kb) to each side of a CpG island are CpG "shores", with CpG "shelves" extending 2 kb beyond CpG shores, with the rest of the genome termed "open sea". These four contexts form the CpG "resort", and the concentration of CpG loci decreases from islands to the open sea. The context of interest may depend on the research question. For example, since DNAm within promoter CpG islands exhibits patterns established during cellular differentiation and passed down through cell lineages, scientists investigating cell-lineage-specific gene regulation and/or identifying epigenetic biomarkers of cell and tissue types may focus on promoter CpG islands. – On the other hand, since DNAm in CpG shores and shelves is more responsive to external factors, – scientists investigating environmental programming of the genome via DNAm and/or trying to determine whether DNAm mediates known associations between exposures and diseases may focus on CpG shores and shelves.

### On the epigenetics of vascular regulation and disease [^112oZuDs]. Clinical Epigenetics (2012). Low credibility.

DNA methylation

DNA methylation is one of the fundamental epigenetic marks that is associated with transcriptional silencing, and plays a key role not only in X-chromosomal inactivation, but also in embryonic development, genomic imprinting, and lineage specification. In mammals, DNA methylation takes place mostly within CpG dinucleotides, where a methyl group that is derived from S-adenosyl-L-methionine is bound in position 5 within the cytosine ring, thus forming 5-methyl-cytosine. This pyrimidine can still constitute a base pair with guanine. In healthy somatic cells, up to 90% of CpG dinucleotides, i.e. 3% to 6% of all cytosines, are methylated, except for promoter CpG islands, which appear to be protected from methylation.

So far, three active DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which catalyse the methylation of mammalian DNA cytosines in position C5, have been described: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b DNMT3L which belongs to the group of DNMT proteins lacks the catalytic activity itself, but is required for the enzymatic activities of DNMT3A and DNMT3B DNMT2 is a highly conserved protein and shows a strong tRNA methyltransferase activity. It is known to methylate aspartic acid transfer RNA without being restricted to this process. Amino acid methylation of arginine and lysine residues of proteins is usually carried out by peptilarginine or lysine methyltransferases, respectively. During embryonic development, DNMT3a and DNMT3b are responsible for de novo methylation, and for the creation of specific DNA methylation patterns. While DNMT3a is essential in the context of genomic imprinting during gametogenesis. DNMT3b plays an important role during embryonic development. DNMT1 is required for the maintenance and propagation of DNA methylation patterns across generations of cells, i.e. the methylation pattern is carried along the replication process during mitotic cell division. DNMT1 is however not that efficient as to the maintenance of methylation patterns within CpG dense regions and during massive demethylation events such as after fertilization, which may as a consequence lead to alterations of the original methylation pattern. Three principal mechanisms are involved in the regulation of gene repression via 5-methyl-cytosine: First, 5-methyl-cytosine can sterically affect transcription factors to their cis -DNA binding elements, as it is described for several transcription factors. During this process, methyl groups of methylated CpG dinucleotides intercalate into the major groove of the DNA helix. Second, methyl-CpG binding proteins such as MeCP2, interfere with the recruitment of transcription factors (i.e. DNA-binding trans factors). Third, these methyl-CpG binding proteins are able to recruit large protein complexes which control the accessibility of DNA through modification of the chromatin structure. On the other hand, a transcriptional activator, human CpG binding protein (hCGBP), has been reported that specifically recognizes and binds un methylated GpG dinucleotides. Even though, both, active (replication-independent), as well as passive (replication-dependent) mechanisms have been described, the process as of how DNA methylation marks are exactly removed, is still unexplained. Therapeutically, nucleoside analogues require proliferating cells in order to inhibit DNA methylation, because the nucleoside analogues exert their activity through an irreversible covalent bond with DNMTs after their incorporation into DNA.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^112EnGud]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genetic evaluation — fragile X DNA testing should be recommended for all children with ASD, especially for boys and for children with a suggestive family history of male members with intellectual disability; the cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat expansion causing fragile X is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test, and approximately 0.45% of individuals with ASD have the full mutation, supporting that it is reasonable to consider testing both male and female patients with ASD.
