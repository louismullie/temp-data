## Question

PCP trophy with acyclovir

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acyclovir has any role in preventing or treating Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and if so, what that role is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what acyclovir actually covers versus what PCP is. Then, I should verify guideline-based prophylaxis for PCP and whether acyclovir is ever included. Next, I will check for any indirect or off-label uses of acyclovir that might be conflated with PCP. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with dosing and alternatives where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Acyclovir is an antiviral with activity against herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus; it has no activity against Pneumocystis jirovecii, which is a fungus, not a virus, so mechanistically acyclovir cannot treat or prevent PCP.

> Wait, let me verify the standard of care for PCP prophylaxis. Across HIV and non-HIV immunocompromised populations, first-line prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), with alternatives such as atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine when TMP-SMX is not tolerated; acyclovir is not listed as a PCP prophylaxis agent in any guideline [^4161a2f3] [^31187b07] [^32243949].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — sometimes acyclovir is recommended alongside PCP prophylaxis, but for a different reason. I need to check oncology and transplant guidelines where dual prophylaxis is common. Indeed, in settings like hairy cell leukemia, T-cell lymphomas treated with alemtuzumab, CLL with purine analogs or PI3K inhibitors, and hematopoietic cell transplantation, guidelines recommend both herpesvirus prophylaxis with acyclovir (or equivalent) and separate PCP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX (or equivalent); acyclovir is for HSV/VZV, not for Pneumocystis [^301abc52] [^4191ce8d] [^cf207ea2] [^2982e649].

> I should double-check whether acyclovir interacts with PCP prophylaxis in ways that would change practice. Pediatric guidance notes that atovaquone levels can be reduced by coadministration with acyclovir, which is a pharmacokinetic interaction relevant when using atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis; this does not make acyclovir a PCP drug, but it does mean clinicians should consider timing or alternatives if relying on atovaquone [^677544fe].

> Let me consider treatment, not just prevention. For active PCP, the evidence-based therapy is TMP-SMX for 21 days, with adjunctive corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe disease; again, acyclovir has no role in treating Pneumocystis, and using it would be inappropriate unless there is a concurrent HSV/VZV indication [^31187b07] [^10a11f03].

> But wait, what if someone is using "PCP trophy" to mean something else, like a "trophy" of successful prophylaxis or a colloquial bundle? I should confirm that this is not a standard term; I find no guideline or study using "PCP trophy", so I will treat this as a misstatement and focus on the clinical question of acyclovir's role in PCP prevention and treatment, which is none.

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: acyclovir does not prevent or treat PCP. It is used for herpesvirus prophylaxis in immunocompromised hosts who also happen to need PCP prophylaxis, so both agents are often co-prescribed for different indications. TMP-SMX remains the cornerstone for PCP prophylaxis and treatment, with alternatives like atovaquone or dapsone when TMP-SMX is not suitable [^31187b07] [^27ce7a25] [^32243949].

---

Acyclovir is **not effective for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)** because it has no activity against Pneumocystis. PCP prophylaxis and treatment rely on **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** as first-line therapy [^27ce7a25], with alternatives such as atovaquone, dapsone, or pentamidine when TMP-SMX is not tolerated [^32243949]. Acyclovir is used for herpesvirus prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients, but it does not prevent or treat PCP [^301abc52]. Using acyclovir for PCP is inappropriate and may delay effective care.

---

## Pharmacological properties of acyclovir

Acyclovir is a guanosine analog that inhibits viral DNA polymerase, thereby blocking replication of herpesviruses, including HSV and VZV [^notfound]. It has **no activity against Pneumocystis jirovecii**, which lacks the viral enzymes targeted by acyclovir [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding acyclovir and PCP

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting acyclovir for PCP prophylaxis or treatment [^notfound]. Trials and guidelines consistently exclude acyclovir from PCP regimens, underscoring its lack of efficacy against Pneumocystis [^0aaf577d].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for PCP prophylaxis and treatment

Current guidelines from CDC, NIH, and IDSA provide clear recommendations for PCP management:

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line prophylaxis/treatment** | **Alternative regimens** |
|-|-|-|
| HIV-infected patients | TMP-SMX | - Atovaquone <br/> - Dapsone <br/> - Pentamidine [^32243949] |
| Non-HIV immunocompromised patients | TMP-SMX | - Atovaquone <br/> - Dapsone <br/> - Pentamidine [^6a053d51] |
| Treatment of active PCP | TMP-SMX | - Pentamidine <br/> - Atovaquone <br/> - Clindamycin + primaquine [^31187b07] |

---

Acyclovir is **not mentioned in any guideline** for PCP prophylaxis or treatment, reinforcing its lack of role in PCP management [^notfound].

---

## Risks and limitations of using acyclovir for PCP

Using acyclovir for PCP poses several risks:

- **Lack of efficacy**: Acyclovir does not inhibit Pneumocystis, so it will not prevent or treat PCP [^notfound].
- **Delayed effective therapy**: Relying on acyclovir can delay initiation of appropriate TMP-SMX or alternative regimens, worsening outcomes [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: Acyclovir can cause nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, particularly at high doses or with impaired renal function [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where acyclovir might be considered alongside PCP prophylaxis

Acyclovir may be co-administered with TMP-SMX when **herpesvirus prophylaxis is indicated** in immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematologic malignancies or transplant recipients [^301abc52] [^4191ce8d]. This is for herpesvirus prevention only and does not substitute for PCP prophylaxis [^301abc52].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Acyclovir is **not effective for PCP** and should not be used for prophylaxis or treatment [^notfound]. Clinicians should adhere to guideline-recommended TMP-SMX regimens and consider alternatives only when TMP-SMX is contraindicated [^27ce7a25]. Acyclovir should be reserved for herpesvirus prophylaxis in select immunocompromised patients, not for PCP management [^301abc52].

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult patients with cancer-related immunosuppression: ASCO and IDSA clinical practice guideline update [^ed8d917f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult patients with immunosuppression associated with cancer and its treatment.

Methods

ASCO and IDSA convened an update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies from May 2011 to November 2016. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel.

Results

Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review.

Recommendations

Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for patients who are at high risk of infection, including patients who are expected to have profound, protracted neutropenia, which is defined as < 100 neutrophils/µL for > 7 days or other risk factors. Herpes simplex virus-seropositive patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or leukemia induction therapy should receive nucleoside analog-based antiviral prophylaxis, such as acyclovir. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is recommended for patients receiving chemotherapy regimens that are associated with a > 3.5% risk for pneumonia as a result of this organism (eg, those with ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalents daily for ≥ 1 month or on the basis of purine analog usage). Treatment with a nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor (eg, entecavir or tenofovir) is recommended for patients at high risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation. Recommendations for vaccination and avoidance of prolonged contact with environments that have high concentrations of airborne fungal spores are also provided within the updated guideline.

### HIV: primary and secondary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections [^2aaf1c1c]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Opportunistic infections can occur in up to 40% of people with HIV infection and a CD4 count less than 250/mm³, although the risks are much lower with use of highly active antiretroviral treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis? What are the effects of antituberculosis prophylaxis in people with HIV infection? What are the effects of prophylaxis for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease for people with, and without, previous MAC disease? What are the effects of prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV)? What are the effects of prophylaxis for invasive fungal disease in people with, and without, previous fungal disease? What are the effects of discontinuing prophylaxis against opportunistic pathogens in people on highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 43 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aciclovir; antituberculosis prophylaxis; atovaquone; azithromycin (alone or plus rifabutin); clarithromycin (alone, or plus rifabutin and ethambutol); discontinuing prophylaxis for CMV, MAC, and PCP; ethambutol added to clarithromycin; famciclovir; fluconazole; isoniazid; itraconazole; oral ganciclovir; rifabutin (alone or plus macrolides); trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; and valaciclovir.

### Pediatric postmarketing pharmacovigilance review… [^792be4da]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

After exclusions, DPV identified seven non-fatal serious pediatric cases with unlabeled adverse events of tachycardia, hypertension, bradycardia, and renal colic. However, these cases were confounded by comorbidities, concomitant medications, or contained limited information for an adequate causality assessment. There were no new safety signals and no increased severity of any labeled events identified for injectable acyclovir at this time. DPV will continue to monitor all adverse events associated with acyclovir use through routine pharmacovigilance. 2 Reference ID:

1. Intravenous Acyclovir Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients Varicella zoster infections in immunocompromised patients
- **12 years of age and older**: 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7 days
- **< 12 years of age**: 20 mg/kg IV. Study ACY01, an open-label study, was conducted to describe the pharmacokinetics of acyclovir in preterm infants.

This study provided pharmacokinetic and safety data on acyclovir in infants with suspected or confirmed HSV. Dosing group assignments were based on gestational age and postnatal age. Thirteen subjects were enrolled under version 1. 0 of the protocol. IV every 8–12 hours). The review team concluded that dosing based on PMA rather than GA or PNA was acceptable, and a PMA cutoff of 34 weeks is more acceptable to produce similar exposures across the age groups. Study ACY02 was a retrospective review of safety data related to acyclovir use in neonates. or unexpected adverse events were reported. The efficacy of the high dose acyclovir was supported primarily by the data generated from the Kimberlin et al study, titled "Safety and Efficacy of High-Dose Intravenous Acyclovir in the Management of Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus Infections". The study was an open-label trial. conducted by Whitely et al.

The review team concluded that that there were differences in the mortality outcome among the three doses, favoring the high dose acyclovir arm across multiple time points over the standard dose and intermediate dose, supporting the high dose with respect to efficacy for the treatment of systemic HSV infection in neonates.

### Is it safe to discontinue primary Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis in patients with virologically suppressed HIV infection and a CD4 cell count [^fcb0c746]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines suggest that primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PcP) can be safely stopped in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who are receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and who have a CD4 cell count > 200 cells/microL. There are few data regarding the incidence of PcP or safety of stopping prophylaxis in virologically suppressed patients with CD4 cell counts of 101–200 cells/microL.

Methods

The Opportunistic Infections Project Team of the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research in Europe (COHERE) included data from 23,412 patients from 12 European cohorts who started taking cART after 1997. Poisson regression was used to model incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of primary PcP.

Results

There were 253 PcP cases during 107,016 person-years of follow-up (PYFU). Prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of PcP among patients with current CD4 cell counts 100 cells/microL (adjusted IRR, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.60) but not significantly among those with current CD4 cell counts of 101–200 cells/microL (adjusted IRR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.34–1.17). The incidence of PcP among patients who had a current CD4 cell count of 100–200 cells/microL, who had a viral load < 400 copies/mL, and who were receiving prophylaxis was 2.1 cases per 1000 PYFU (95% CI, 0.8–4.3 cases per 1000 PYFU; 7 events occurred during 3363 PYFU), whereas 1.2 cases per 1000 PYFU (95% CI, 0.2–4.5 cases per 1000 PYFU; 2 events occurred during 1614 PYFU) occurred among persons who were not receiving prophylaxis (adjusted IRR, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.33–8.15). Among patients who discontinued PcP prophylaxis after starting cART, the incidence of primary PcP was 0 cases per 1000 PYFU (95% CI, 0.0–2.7 cases per 1000 PYFU; 0 events occurred during 1363 PYFU) for patients who had a current CD4 cell count of 101–200 cells/microL and who were receiving cART.

Conclusions

The incidence of primary PcP among patients who had virologically suppressed HIV infection, were receiving cART, and who had CD4 cell counts > 100 cells/microL was low irrespective of prophylaxis use. Discontinuation of prophylaxis may be safe in patients with CD4 counts of 101–200 cells/microL and suppressed viral load.

Managing treatment failure in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Clinical failure is defined as lack of improvement or worsening of respiratory function documented by arterial blood gases after 4 to 8 days of anti-PCP treatment, and failure attributed to lack of drug efficacy occurs in approximately 10% of people with HIV with mild-to-moderate PCP disease. Clinicians should wait 4 to 8 days before switching therapy for lack of clinical improvement (BIII), and in the absence of corticosteroid therapy, early and reversible deterioration within the first 3 to 5 days of therapy is typical. However, there are not any convincing clinical trial data on which to base recommendations for the management of PCP treatment failure due to lack of drug efficacy.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis regimens for people living with HIV: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^32243949]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection among people living with HIV (PWH), particularly among new and untreated cases. Several regimens are available for the prophylaxis of PCP, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), dapsone-based regimens (DBRs), aerosolized pentamidine (AP), and atovaquone.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of PCP prophylaxis regimens in PWH by network meta-analysis.

Methods

DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL from inception to June 21, 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

PWH.

Interventions

Regimens for PCP prophylaxis either compared head-to-head or versus no treatment/placebo.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs 2.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Title or abstract and full-text screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Data on PCP incidence, all-cause mortality, and discontinuation due to toxicity were pooled and ranked by network meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses of primary versus secondary prophylaxis, by year, and by dosage were performed.

Results

A total of 26 RCTs, comprising 55 treatment arms involving 7516 PWH were included. For the prevention of PCP, TMP-SMX was ranked the most favourable agent and was superior to DBRs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.83) and AP (RR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36–0.77). TMP-SMX was also the only agent with a mortality benefit compared with no treatment/placebo (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98). However, TMP-SMX was also ranked as the most toxic agent with a greater risk of discontinuation than DBRs (RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54) and AP (7.20; 95% CI, 5.37–9.66). No significant differences in PCP prevention or mortality were detected among the other regimens. The findings remained consistent within subgroups.

Conclusions

TMP-SMX is the most effective agent for PCP prophylaxis in PWH and the only agent to confer a mortality benefit; consequently, it should continue to be recommended as the first-line agent. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal dosing of TMP-SMX to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

### Current epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia [^c7c7fd63]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Despite the declines in death and disease from HIV in the United States and western Europe, PCP remains an important disease and is unlikely to be eradicated. In industrialized nations, PCP still occurs in those not yet diagnosed with HIV or not in medical care, those not receiving PCP prophylaxis, and those not taking or not responding to HAART. Resistance in HIV and Pneumocystis may contribute to future increases in PCP incidence. In most developing nations, AIDS patients are at high risk for PCP. In sub-Saharan Africa, the effect of disease from PCP in infants and children is high and is probably greater in adults than previously recognized. Colonization rates among both HIV-infected and non–HIV-infected populations may also be substantial. Better understanding of the epidemiology and transmission of PCP, and improved efforts in prevention and treatment, are needed.

### Acyclovir for mechanically ventilated patients with herpes simplex virus oropharyngeal reactivation… [^5625022a]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

By November 16, 2016, although 206 patients had been randomized, the dates of validity of the initially manufactured opaque bottles that contained either the placebo or acyclovir powder had expired. Because funding for replacing the powders was not available, it was decided to continue the trial only in the 2 centers with the highest inclusion rates — Hôpitaux Universitaires Pitié Salpêtrière-Charles Foix and Hôpitaux de Marseille — and to use a different placebo and acyclovir distribution procedure that would keep investigators blind without requiring additional budget. Our study results show that preemptive acyclovir administration, compared with placebo for mechanically ventilated patients with oropharyngeal HSV reactivation, was not associated with shorter mechanical ventilation durations, as assessed by the number of ventilator-free days. Moreover, other secondary outcomes did not differ between acyclovir recipients and controls.

Nonsignificant lower day 60 mortality was observed for acyclovir recipients compared with controls. Acyclovir was well tolerated at the dose administered, without renal or neurologic adverse events, although our study was underpowered to assess such major complications. Research on HSV reactivation and its prognosis has been published4; however, to our knowledge, Tuxen et al8 conducted the only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on acyclovir efficacy against HSV reactivation. They randomized 45 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome to receive prophylactic acyclovir or placebo and found that acyclovir was associated with significantly less HSV reactivation, but not with shorter mechanical ventilation durations or lower mortality.

As indicated above, some investigators have postulated that acyclovir could improve the prognosis of ICU patients having reactivated HSV by limiting the bronchioalveolar damage secondary to viral infection, and/or by preventing CMV replication, even the anti-CMV effect of acyclovir is usually observed with higher doses than the ones. used in our study. 1, 2, 4, 17 Although the acyclovir group had a nonsignificant lower day 60 mortality, the number of ventilator-free days was comparable to that of placebo-treated patients, implying that survivors in the acyclovir group had a longer mechanical ventilation duration than the placebo recipient survivors. Conversely, we cannot be sure whether acyclovir, 5 mg/kg, 3 times da.

### Withdrawal of Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis in HIV-infected children under highly active antiretroviral therapy [^5016c128]. AIDS (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

In HIV-infected adults Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis can be safely withdrawn after immune reconstitution due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). With regard to children only a small amount of data has been published. The present study investigated whether the withdrawal of PCP prophylaxis after immune reconstitution is safe in HIV-infected children.

Methods

A retrospective analysis at 10 European centers belonging to the Pediatric European Network on the treatment of AIDS (PENTA) using a standardized questionnaire.

Results

A total of 113 questionnaires were received. In 82 children the indication for PCP prophylaxis was provided following Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines (72 primary and 10 secondary). Prophylaxis was withdrawn after the CD4 cell count increased above the age-related CDC thresholds. The observation period off prophylaxis was 335 years (300 years for primary and 35 years for secondary prophylaxis) and the median time per patient off prophylaxis was 4.1 years (range, 0.3–7.7 years). No episode of PCP occurred during the study period. In comparison with the incidence rate from historical data before the introduction of PCP prophylaxis and HAART, this was a significant reduction (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The increase in CD4 cell count provides functional reconstitution of the immune system in children. Our data suggests that the risk of developing a PCP after immune reconstitution is sufficiently low to withdraw PCP prophylaxis.

### Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in non-HIV immunocompromised patients [^6a053d51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a disease affecting immunocompromised patients. PCP among these patients is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of PCP prophylaxis among non-HIV immunocompromised patients; and to define the type of immunocompromised patient for whom evidence suggests a benefit for PCP prophylaxis.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to March 2014), LILACS (to March 2014), relevant conference proceedings; and references of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing prophylaxis with an antibiotic effective against PCP versus placebo, no intervention, or antibiotic(s) with no activity against PCP; and trials comparing different antibiotics effective against PCP among immunocompromised non-HIV patients. We only included trials in which Pneumocystis infections were available as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each trial and extracted data from the included trials. We contacted authors of the included trials to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was documented PCP infections. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials performed between the years 1974 and 2008 were included, involving 1412 patients. Four trials included 520 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the remaining trials included adults with acute leukemia, solid organ transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Compared to no treatment or treatment with fluoroquinolones (inactive against Pneumocystis), there was an 85% reduction in the occurrence of PCP in patients receiving prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; 10 trials, 1000 patients). The evidence was graded as moderate due to possible risk of bias. PCP-related mortality was also significantly reduced, RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; nine trials, 886 patients) (low quality of evidence due to possible risk of bias and imprecision), but in trials comparing PCP prophylaxis against placebo or no treatment there was no significant effect on all-cause mortality (low quality of evidence due to imprecision). Occurrence of leukopenia or neutropenia and their duration were not reported consistently. No significant differences in overall adverse events or events requiring discontinuation were seen comparing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to no treatment or placebo (four trials, 470 patients, moderate quality evidence). No differences between once daily versus thrice weekly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were seen (two trials, 207 patients).

Authors' Conclusions

Given an event rate of 6.2% in the control groups of the included trials, prophylaxis for PCP using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is highly effective among non-HIV immunocompromised patients, with a number needed to treat to prevent PCP of 19 patients (95% CI 17 to 42). Prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a similar baseline risk of PCP.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) primary prophylaxis — discontinuation and reintroduction with antiretroviral therapy is specified as follows: Primary Pneumocystis prophylaxis should be discontinued in adult and adolescent patients who have responded to ART with an increase in CD4 counts from < 200 cells/mm³ to > 200 cells/mm³ for > 3 months (AI). At discontinuation in supporting studies, the median CD4 count was > 300 cells/mm³, most participants had a CD4 cell percentage ≥ 14%, many had sustained suppression of HIV plasma RNA below detection limits for the assay employed, and median follow-up was 6 months to 19 months. Prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the patient's CD4 count decreases to < 200 cells/mm³ (AIII). A combined analysis, a small randomized trial, and a case series found a low incidence of PCP in patients with CD4 counts between 100 cells/mm³ and 200 cells/mm³, who were receiving ART and had HIV plasma viral loads < 50 to 400 copies/mL, and who had stopped or never received PCP prophylaxis.

### Impact of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia on kidney transplant outcome [^74546df2]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

With the continued development of immunosuppressive regimens in the past decade, death-censored graft failures have gradually decreased in recipients of both living and deceased kidney recipients. However, the mortality rates in patients with functioning grafts remain unchanged over the past 10 years. More information on the causes of mortality unrelated to graft failure is therefore needed to further improve the survival of transplant recipients.

Infection is an important factor in relation to the risk of death in kidney transplant recipients, and the second most common cause of death after cardiovascular disease in patients with functioning grafts. The incidence of most infectious diseases, such as urinary tract infection and sepsis, has been steadily maintained over the past 15 years. Despite its clinical implication of these infectious diseases, there is little data on immunologic outcomes after specific infectious disease in transplant recipients. Further studies of post-transplant infectious events are therefore needed to characterize and ultimately improve survival outcomes.

Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe pulmonary infection in immunocompromized hosts. The incidence of P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) varies from 0.6 to 14% among kidney transplant recipients without prophylaxis, with a mortality of up to 50% despite aggressive antibiotic therapy. Several studies have investigated the relationship between PCP and mortality, but the effect of PCP on graft rejection and overall graft outcomes has been less-well explored. Certain infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus have demonstrated relationships with acute rejection during the early posttransplant period. This is a meaningful clinical issue, given that appropriate infection prophylaxis and treatment regimens could be implemented to address subsequent immunological complications. However, the clinical implications of PCP have not yet been resolved. Herein, we evaluated the impact of PCP on kidney transplant outcomes, including graft failure and rejection.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia — treatment recommendations: TMP-SMX, administered IV, is the recommended treatment for PCP (AI). As the acute pneumonitis subsides, children with mild-to moderate disease who do not have malabsorption or diarrhea can be transitioned to oral treatment with the same total daily dose of TMP-SMX administered in 3 or 4 divided doses to complete a 21-day course (AII). IV pentamidine isethionate once daily is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX or who demonstrate clinical treatment failure after 5 to 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy (AI*). Atovaquone is an alternative for treatment of mild-to-moderately severe PCP (BI*), and dapsone/TMP is effective in treating mild-to-moderate PCP (BI*). Clindamycin/primaquine has been used to treat mild-to-moderate PCP; data in children are unavailable (BIII). A short course of corticosteroids is recommended in cases of moderate or severe PCP, starting within 72 hours of diagnosis (AI*).

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with or without AIDS, France [^c03ff3cc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), caused by the fungus P. jirovecii (formerly P. carinii), is a life-threatening, opportunistic infection that is often the AIDS-defining illness in patients with HIV infection. Consequently, PCP has been extensively studied as a manifestation of the AIDS epidemic. However, in high-resource countries, the decrease in the prevalence of AIDS and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy and routine primary PCP prophylaxis have diminished the number of patients with HIV-related PCP. At the same time, PCP has emerged as a concern in patients with non–HIV-related immune deficiencies. PCP has become more common among these patients as a result of treatment changes such as increasing use of immunosuppressive agents to treat malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory diseases, as well as an increase in the number of solid organ transplants (SOTs). Thus, patients who have hematologic or solid-organ malignancies or autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, or those who have received an SOT or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), are at high risk for PCP.

Whether these changes in PCP epidemiology have affected the clinical manifestation and outcome of the disease remains unclear. As early as 1989, a biological study that compared PCP in patients with and without AIDS found significant differences in fungi counts and lung inflammation. Another study evaluated clinical manifestations and outcomes of PCP in patients without AIDS seen during 1980–1993 but did not include a comparison with AIDS patients. In a study comparing PCP in AIDS and non-AIDS patients in Basel, Switzerland, during 1982–1998, non-AIDS patients more often required intensive care and mechanical ventilation, although rates of death were not significantly different for the 2 groups. The Switzerland study and another comparison of AIDS and non-AIDS patients with PCP published in 1984 found that symptom duration was longer and oxygen tension needs higher for AIDS patients.

These studies suggest that differences in PCP pathogenesis and influences of the underlying disease or treatment may affect the expression of PCP. However, recent data are lacking on the differences between clinical features and outcomes of PCP in AIDS and non-AIDS patients. Clinicians need this information to help identify patients who require prophylaxis and to enable early diagnosis of PCP at a stage when treatment is most likely to be effective. To obtain data on manifestations and outcomes of PCP in recent years and to identify risk factors for death, we performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of consecutive patients with confirmed PCP admitted to 17 hospitals in France during 2007–2010.

Objective

To review the evidence for discontinuing primary and secondary Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3).

Data Sources

We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the International Aids Society Library (up to August 2015) using the following key search terms: Pneumocystis jirovecii, pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus, primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, and discontinuation.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language studies that evaluated discontinuation of primary and/or secondary PJP prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) were included.

Data Synthesis

Five studies were identified, which varied in design, sample size, outcomes, and duration of follow-up. Three studies examined discontinuation of primary and secondary PJP prophylaxis; 1 study evaluated discontinuing primary PJP prophylaxis; and 1 study evaluated stopping secondary PJP prophylaxis. Two out of the 5 studies pooled data for all opportunistic infections. Overall, there was a low incidence of PJP among HIV-infected patients who discontinued primary PJP prophylaxis and were well controlled on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Conclusions

Discontinuation of primary PJP prophylaxis appears to be safe in patients on combination ART with a suppressed HIV viral load and a CD4 count > 100 cells/mm(3). Additional data are needed to support the safety of discontinuing secondary PJP prophylaxis. Decisions to discontinue PJP prophylaxis in patients with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) should be done on an individual patient basis, taking into consideration clinical factors, including ongoing adherence to ART.

Occurrence in Relation to PCP Prophylaxis

PCP still occurs in industrialized nations despite the availability of HAART and anti- Pneumocystis prophylaxis. ASD investigated the history of prescriptions for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected adults in whom developed PCP from 1999 through 2001 (Figure 2). Almost 44% of PCP cases occurred in patients not receiving medical care, most of whom were probably not known to be HIV-infected. Forty-one percent of patients were prescribed prophylaxis but did not adhere to treatment, or PCP developed despite their taking medications appropriately. Possible explanations for PCP in the "breakthrough" group include the development of drug-resistant Pneumocystis or decreased efficacy of prophylaxis in those with low CD4+ cell counts. An additional 9.6% of patients were under medical care and should have received prophylaxis based on current recommendations, but had not been prescribed prophylaxis by their providers. Five percent of patients were under care but did not meet criteria for prophylaxis.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) recurrence — when to restart primary or secondary prophylaxis: Primary or secondary PCP prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the patient's CD4 count decreases to < 100 cells/mm³ (AIII) regardless of the HIV plasma viral load, and prophylaxis should also be reintroduced for patients with CD4 counts of 100 cells/mm³ to 200 cells/mm³ with HIV plasma viral load above detection limits of the assay used (AIII). Based on results from the COHERE study, primary or secondary PCP prophylaxis may not need to be restarted in patients with CD4 counts of 100 cells/mm³ to 200 cells/mm³ who have had HIV plasma RNA levels below limits of detection for ≥ 3 to 6 months (BII).

Conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, and supportive care

All patients received intermediate-intensity conditioning consisting of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg (day −6), fludarabine 150 mg/m² (30 mg/m²/day on days −6 to −2), thiotepa 10 mg/kg (5 mg/kg/day on days −5 and −4), and total body irradiation 400 cGy (200 cGy/day on days −2 and −1).GVHD prophylaxis consisted of IV CSA and MMF (15 mg/kg every 8 hours [capped at 1.5 g per dose]) starting on day −3 as previously described. Trial patients also received 1 dose of tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg (capped at 800 mg) on day −1.

All patients received antimicrobial prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone. In addition, per institutional practice, patients received IV vancomycin prophylaxis starting on day −2 (except between August 2019 and November 2020 when omission of vancomycin was evaluated per institution-wide policy). All patients received acyclovir prophylaxis. Letermovir at a dose of 240 mg daily was started on day +7 in cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive patients since 2018 and was continued for a minimum of 180 days (insurance permitting), as previously described. Micafungin was given from admission and switched to a mold-active azole after day 7 for at least 75 days, or longer in the presence of aGVHD. All patients received pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis from 3 to 4 weeks after the transplant (timing and type based on toxoplasma serology). Patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor at a dose of 5 μg/kg/day from day +7 until neutrophil recovery. Patients with a first neutropenic fever between days 7 and 21, in addition to receiving broader antibiotic coverage as appropriate, were started on IV methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily for 3 days for pre-engraftment syndrome (PES). The corticosteroid course could be extended for persistent signs or symptoms of PES. CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and adenovirus viral loads in peripheral blood were monitored using polymerase chain reaction after transplant according to institutional guidelines. Treatment for CMV reactivation was considered for any detected viral load before institution of letermovir prophylaxis, and for levels > 300 copies in letermovir recipients. Treatment for EBV, HHV-6, and adenovirus reactivation was based on viral load kinetics and levels and on concern for organ involvement.

### Pneumocystis jiroveci: still troublesome to diagnose and treat [^878727bb]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) poses an important risk in immunodeficient patients. Several aspects of the pathogenesis and management of PJP remain poorly understood. The aim of this review is to describe new trends and challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of PJP focused on non-HIV patients compared with patients living with HIV.

Recent Findings

The immune response to Pneumocystis jiroveci infection varies among different host types and modifies clinical and radiological presentation. The performance of microbiological diagnostic tests depends on pretest probability according to baseline disease, clinical presentation, and radiological pattern. Real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR tests have been proposed as the optimal method for PJP diagnosis, but it is essential to interpret PCR results within the clinical context. Therapy of PJP has not changed substantially, but new options with low-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and combination treatment with old and new antifungals are being explored. The use of complementary steroid treatment is well established in patients living with HIV but is controversial in non-HIV patients. Protocols for primary and secondary PJP prophylaxis are evolving. Evidence for nosocomial acquisition and possible person-to-person transmission of infection suggests the need for formal infection control policies.

Summary

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis of PJP, but several challenges remain to be addressed. Future efforts should focus on developing new diagnostic methods, treatment options and risk stratification tools to improve prevention strategies.

### Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients: a randomized trial by the CIOP study group [^ab8faf91]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

This subgroup analysis assessing secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) describes a multicenter, open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the discontinuation of PCP prophylaxis. The main inclusion criterion was a history of PCP and an increase in the CD4 cell count to > 200 cells/microL associated with receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy for ≥ 3 months. The primary end point was the development of definitive or presumptive PCP. A total of 146 patients were enrolled (77 in the treatment discontinuation arm). After > 2 years, 1 definitive and 1 presumptive case of PCP were observed, both of which occurred in patients who discontinued therapy. In most patients, secondary prophylaxis for PCP can be safely discontinued after potent antiretroviral therapy is initiated, but the threshold of > 200 CD4 cells/microL may not be considered absolutely safe. Patients who present with symptoms after discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis should be evaluated for PCP despite high CD4 count and complete virus suppression.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) secondary prophylaxis — indications for discontinuation: CD4 count increased from < 200 cells/mm³ to > 200 cells/mm³ for > 3 months as a result of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (BII), or can consider if CD4 count is 100–200 cells/mm³ and HIV RNA remains below limits of detection of assay used for ≥ 3 months to 6 months (BII). For patients in whom PCP occurs at a CD4 count > 200 cells/mm³ while not on ART, discontinuation of prophylaxis can be considered once HIV RNA levels are suppressed to below limits of detection of the assay used for ≥ 3 months to 6 months, although there are no data to support recommendations in this setting (CIII). Note: If an episode of PCP occurs at a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³ while a patient is on ART, it would be prudent to continue PCP prophylaxis for life, regardless of how high the CD4 cell count rises as a consequence of ART (BIII).

Discussion

This multicenter, prospective study describes the current picture of PCP in immunocompromised patients with or without AIDS in a high-resource country. In this cohort, AIDS-related PCP was less common than was PCP associated with other types of immunosuppression. Our findings confirm several differences between AIDS and non-AIDS patients in clinical presentation and outcomes related to PCP, as described by Kovacs et al. The progression of PCP was faster for non-AIDS patients; these patients had a significantly shorter time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis but still experienced a faster progression of illness, including more severe hypoxemia, greater need for intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation, higher prevalence of shock, and a longer time to PCP treatment initiation. Death rates were also significantly higher for non-AIDS patients, and one of the variables independently associated with death was longer time to PCP treatment initiation for non-AIDS patients.

This study offers several contributions toward the development of PCP prophylaxis guidelines for specific at-risk groups. One of the reasons for the lower proportion of AIDS patients than of non-AIDS patients in this study population could have been the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy and PCP prophylaxis among AIDS patients. However, among patients with AIDS in our study, only 3 (2.7%) were receiving PCP prophylaxis; for 100 (44.8%) patients, the PCP diagnosis was the reason for the AIDS diagnosis.

In our study, PCP treatment was started later after admission in non-AIDS patients than in AIDS patients, and longer time to treatment independently predicted odds for death, which is in agreement with findings of an earlier study. Longer time to treatment was the only predictor of death in our study that could be mitigated. Treatment initiation differed by only 1 day for AIDS versus non-AIDS patients, yet this difference was associated with reduced death rates for AIDS patients. Therefore, because routine implementation of PCP treatment on admission may be associated with higher survival, clinicians should implement treatment as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, without waiting the 2 days required to confirm the diagnosis.

### Withholding primary Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in virologically suppressed patients with human immunodeficiency virus: an emulation of a pragmatic trial in COHERE [^a07e0b87]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) is an opportunistic disease contracted by individuals with a weakened immune system, and it remains one of the most frequent AIDS-defining diagnoses in resource-rich countries in late presenters.

People diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and with low CD4 lymphocyte counts are at risk of developing PcP and should be prescribed combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in order to suppress plasma viral load and prophylactic treatments. Adding prophylactic treatment, apart from increasing pill burden, could cause adverse events and potentially increase the risk of antibacterial resistance due to prolonged usage.

The Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) in EuroCoord was a project-based collaboration that comprised 40 adult, pediatric, and mother–child HIV cohorts across Europe. The collaboration, which was active from 2005 to 2015, allowed for annual coordinated data collection via a centrally developed standardized operating procedure. The COHERE collaboration addressed novel research questions that could not be studied adequately in individual cohorts.

Previous analyses conducted on COHERE suggested that primary PcP prophylaxis can be safely withdrawn in patients with CD4 counts of 100–200 cells/µL if HIV RNA is suppressed. A more recent study added new findings, indicating that PcP incidence off prophylaxis was below 1 per 100 person-years (py) for virologically suppressed individuals with a CD4 count above 100 cells/µL, concluding that primary (and secondary) prophylaxis might not be needed in such cases. However, it remains to be determined if PcP prophylaxis might be fully withdrawn for patients with consistently suppressed HIV viral load (VL), irrespective of CD4 count.

The current European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines that are, at least partially, based on the results from these studies recommend the following rules for stopping primary PcP prophylaxis (page 105 of): "Stop: if CD4 count > 100 cells/μL and HIV-VL undetectable for over 3 months", whereas the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines state: "Primary pneumocystis prophylaxis should be discontinued in adult and adolescent patients who have responded to ART with an increase in CD4 counts from < 200 cells/mm³ to > 200 cells/mm³ for > 3 months".

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with or without AIDS, France [^02567e19]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings indicate that PCP prophylaxis could improve outcomes for high-risk patients without AIDS. Among non-AIDS patients in this study, 99 (30.8%) were SOT recipients, a population for which recent guidelines recommend PCP prophylaxis for 6–12 months, a period that might be extended on the basis of level of immunosuppression and immunosuppressive drug requirements. Despite this recommendation, however, recent studies suggest that 1 month of prophylaxis would be sufficient for kidney transplant patients. Given the high rate of death in our cohort, this conclusion should be challenged. Maintaining a high index of suspicion for PCP in immunocompromised patients appears to be of the utmost importance. In addition, as with AIDS patients, every effort should be made to ensure compliance with PCP prophylaxis in non-AIDS patients. Non-AIDS patients may be less aware than AIDS patients that they are at risk for PCP. This point may be of particular relevance, as the course of PCP was significantly more acute in non-AIDS patients, with a median symptom duration of 5 (range 1–15) days compared with 21 (7–30) days for AIDS patients (p < 0.0001). Educating non-AIDS patients about PCP might result in earlier medical evaluation and hospital admission and, consequently, in shorter lengths of time to PCP diagnosis and treatment. In addition, development of rapid and minimally invasive diagnostic tests could improve the early diagnosis and treatment of PCP.

We found marked differences in death rates across patient groups. Deaths were lowest for AIDS patients and highest for HSCT recipients, and rates in our study were consistent with earlier data. Microbial co-infection rates in our study were also in agreement with earlier data. More than one fourth of our patients overall had microbial co-infection, which indicates a need for comprehensive diagnostic investigations in patients with PCP and for routine broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug therapy when findings are atypical for PCP.

Adjunctive steroid therapy has been proven to increase survival in AIDS patients with severe PCP, but 2 small retrospective studies found that adjunctive steroids had no effect on survival for non-AIDS patients. In our study, although non-AIDS patients had more severe hypoxemia and more often required invasive mechanical ventilation, they received adjunctive steroid therapy significantly less often than did AIDS patients.

### HIV: treating Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) [^99da84d9]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a common AIDS-defining opportunistic illness in people with HIV infection, but its incidence has fallen with use of prophylactic treatment. Without treatment, PCP is likely to be fatal in people with AIDS, so placebo-controlled studies would be considered unethical.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of first-line antipneumocystis treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people infected with HIV? What are the effects of adjuvant corticosteroids in people receiving first-line antipneumocystis treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people infected with HIV? What are the effects of treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people infected with HIV who have not responded to first-line antipneumocystis treatment? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adjuvant corticosteroids, aerosolised or intravenous pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin-primaquone, treatment after failure of first-line treatment, trimethoprim-dapsone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole).

### Pneumocystis jirovecii in solid organ transplant recipients: updates in epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^1b589cbd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights the epidemiology of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in solid organ transplant recipients, advancements in the diagnostic landscape, and updates in treatment and prevention.

Recent Findings

The increasing use of immune-depleting agents in the context of solid organ transplantation has given rise to P. jirovecii pneumonia in this population. The use of prophylaxis has dramatically reduced risk of infection; however, late-onset infections occur after cessation of prophylaxis and in the setting of lymphopenia, advancing patient age, acute allograft rejection, and cytomegalovirus infection. Diagnosis requires respiratory specimens, with PCR detection of Pneumocystis replacing traditional staining methods. Quantitative PCR may be a useful adjunct to differentiate between infection and colonization. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing is gaining attention as a noninvasive diagnostic tool. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the drug of choice for treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia. Novel antifungal agents are under investigation.

Summary

P. jirovecii is a fungal opportunistic pathogen that remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Early detection and timely treatment remain the pillars of management.

### PCP prophylaxis with use of corticosteroids by neurologists [^114c0f30]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is increasingly reported in patients without HIV. Corticosteroids are a major risk factor, with up to 90% of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment prior to the development of PCP. In view of this, many specialties now prescribe PCP prophylaxis to patients receiving prolonged or high-dose glucocorticoid regimens. Neurologists frequently prescribe corticosteroids but may not be as aware of the risk for PCP. Here, we review the evidence for routine PCP prophylaxis among regular glucocorticoid users and ask what guidance there is on the subject for neurologists.

### Withholding primary Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in virologically suppressed patients with human immunodeficiency virus: an emulation of a pragmatic trial in COHERE [^278927ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has a number of other limitations. We emulate a target trial and it being unblinded has drawbacks; we cannot rule out potential behavioral changes associated with a patient knowing that he/she is on prophylaxis. The presence of undiagnosed PcP at the time the trial is started is a potential risk in both a hypothetical target and an emulated trial. In our observational data, certain physicians may be more, or less, cautious about prescribing prophylaxis, perhaps depending on unrecorded characteristics that may influence the outcome. We restricted follow-up to 5 years to mirror a realistic trial, but this means our risk analysis is accordingly limited to this time period. In terms of the general application of our results, it is important to note that, although data from 23 European cohorts were included in the analysis, 2 of the large European countries (France, United Kingdom) were potentially underrepresented in the analysis. In addition, our study does not include participants under 16 years of age, and therefore the conclusions are not generalizable to children living with HIV. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, 36% of patients (n = 1752) had a CD4 count of 100 cells/μL or less and 16% of patients (n = 787) had a CD4 count of 50 cells/μL or less at baseline in the analysis. However, these patients contributed overproportionally to the number of PcP diagnoses with 23 of 52 (44%) and 12 of 52 (23%), respectively. Notwithstanding the results presented from this study, clinicians may require further reassurance of our findings before choosing to stop prophylaxis for these higher-risk groups.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in intensive care: clinical spectrum, prophylaxis patterns, antibiotic treatment delay impact, and role of corticosteroids. A French multicentre prospective cohort study [^1c99acdc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic infection affecting immunocompromised patients, and its incidence has risen in recent decades. It now affects more patients not infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than HIV patients. PJP is potentially severe and is linked to a hospital mortality of about 5–15% in patients with HIV infection. Mortality escalates significantly beyond 50% when affecting patients with cancer, haematologic malignancy, pre-existing heart or respiratory failure, or is associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or septic shock requiring admission to intensive care.

Evidence from the past 15 years indicates that patients with autoimmune rheumatic or vascular inflammatory diseases, among others, are increasingly susceptible due to immunosuppressive treatments. Within this specific population, antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrates divergent practices without a unified consensus. In immunocompromised individuals, PJP should be suspected in cases of diffuse pneumonia, with or without respiratory distress. However, studies have underscored delays in initiating treatment among a subset of these patients during the initial hospitalization, potentially impacting in-hospital survival rates.

While corticosteroid therapy for PJP with hypoxemia in HIV patients has shown efficacy, uncertainties persist regarding its benefits in non-HIV patients.

There is a paucity of studies specifically dedicated to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with PJP, leading to imprecise estimates of hospital mortality, long-term outcomes, and required supportive care for patients with the most severe forms of PJP.

In this context, we initiated a multicentre prospective observational study to describe ICU admission conditions for PJP patients, their clinical presentation, estimate the prevalence of prophylaxis, and finally, determine prevalence of delayed antibiotic treatment and corticosteroids use, and assess their association with 6-month mortality following ICU admission.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected children: a global perspective [^3083a404]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and death in HIV-infected children. The aim of this study was to review recent advances in the epidemiology, cause, management and prevention of pneumonia in HIV-infected children.

Recent Findings

Pneumonia remains a major cause of death and hospitalization, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the paediatric HIV epidemic is concentrated. HIV-infected children have a higher risk of developing pneumonia and of more severe disease than immunocompetent children. Bacterial pathogens especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria predominate, with rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is increasingly reported to cause acute pneumonia. Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) remains an important cause of severe pneumonia especially in infants. Viral infections, especially cytomegalovirus-associated pneumonia are common. Polymicrobial infection is increasingly recognized and associated with a worse prognosis. HIV-exposed, negative children have an increased risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens and a poorer outcome than HIV-unexposed children. Increasing access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced the incidence of severe pneumonia, eliminated most opportunistic infections and improved outcome. However, pneumonia remains the major cause of morbidity in HIV-infected children taking HAART. Standard case management guidelines are effective at decreasing mortality but require adaptation for high HIV-prevalence areas. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used as empiric therapy. Infants or children who are not taking pneumocystis prophylaxis should be treated for PCP. A number of general or specific preventive strategies are effective including early use of HAART at the time of HIV diagnosis, pathogen-specific immunizations, in particular pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and antibiotic prophylaxis against PCP.

Summary

Greater access to preventive and treatment strategies, especially PCP prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunization and HAART, are urgently needed in areas of high childhood HIV prevalence.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^dc99e338]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia — alternatives when TMP-SMX is not suitable or if failure after 5–7 days: Under "If TMP-SMX-Intolerant or Clinical Treatment Failure After 5–7 Days of TMP-SMX Therapy", pentamidine 4 mg/kg body weight/dose IV/IM once daily is the first-choice alternative regimen and can be changed to atovaquone after 7–10 days IV therapy; atovaquone daily dosing is 30–40 mg/kg by mouth once daily with food for children aged 1–3 months and > 24 months–12 years, or 45 mg/kg by mouth once daily with food for children aged 4–24 months, and twice-daily dosing options include 750 mg/dose by mouth twice daily for children aged ≥ 13 years and 15–20 mg/kg by mouth twice daily with food for children aged 1–3 months and > 24 months to 12 years, noting that some experts use twice-daily dosing as an alternative treatment for PCP in children aged < 12 years.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^77f6b9be]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to first-line antimicrobial therapy, HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering standard doses of TMP/SMX in patients developing PCP despite TMP/SMX prophylaxis.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia complicating immunosuppressive therapy in Crohn's disease: a preventable problem? [^dacb9159]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 76-year-old man who presented with moderate active Crohn's colitis that was refractory to high-dose corticosteroids, mesalazine and 6-mercaptopurine. He subsequently received a trial of infliximab with poor response and was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, improving on antiviral therapy. Three weeks into treatment he developed acute respiratory distress with hypoxaemia and diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates. This was confirmed as Pneumocystis jirovecii on bronchoalveolar lavage. He responded well to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and was subsequently discharged home. Despite the favourable outcome, our case raises the question of whether chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is appropriate. There are currently no recommendations on providing chemoprophylaxis against CMV colitis and so we focus on pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) where wide debate surrounds the use of prophylactic TMP-SMX in HIV-negative patients. Contrasting approaches to chemoprophylaxis against PCP in IBD likely relates to a lack of clear parameters for defining risk of PCP among patient groups. This must be addressed in order to develop universal guidelines that take into account patient-dependent risk factors. Awareness of the severity of PCP among HIV-negative individuals and the current consensus on PCP prophylaxis in IBD must be raised in order to minimise the risk of PCP and drive research in this controversial area.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^6f4a8f42]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN CLL/SLL supportive care — anti-infective prophylaxis: Recommended during treatment and thereafter (if tolerated) for patients receiving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, purine analog- or bendamustine-based CIT, and/or alemtuzumab; herpes virus prophylaxis with acyclovir or equivalent and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or equivalent are included. Consider PJP and varicella zoster virus (VZV) prophylaxis in patients at increased risk for opportunistic infection and receiving BTKi therapy. Monitor for fungal infection. Monitor blood counts and consider fluoroquinolone and/or fungal prophylaxis for venetoclax-induced neutropenia. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis and monitoring is recommended for patients at high risk. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^05e21fc6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Children With and Exposed to HIV — pneumonia-related management notes include the following: Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.
