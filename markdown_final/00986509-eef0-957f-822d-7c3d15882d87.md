## Question

Is it common to have mild disc bulge in 22 old age

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is common to have a mild disc bulge at age 22. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "mild disc bulge" is defined radiologically and how to distinguish it from protrusion or extrusion. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates in asymptomatic young adults, ideally around age 20–22. Next, I will check whether these findings are truly incidental or correlate with symptoms. After that, I should consider age-related trends and whether degeneration starts this early. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful bottom line and counseling points, making sure I anchor each step to high-quality data and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misclassify the finding. A disc bulge is a circumferential extension of annular tissue beyond the vertebral endplates involving more than 90 degrees of the disc circumference, which contrasts with a protrusion that is focal and has a base wider than the dome; this matters because bulges are more often age-related and less specific for symptoms than focal herniations [^7bdf9bf6].

> Now, I should verify prevalence in the exact age range. In a population-based MRI study of 558 young Finnish adults aged 20–22, 25% had at least one disc bulge, and importantly, there was no sex difference in bulge prevalence, which supports the idea that this is a common early-adult finding rather than an outlier [^6feface6]. Wait, let me verify consistency across cohorts: in a separate cohort of 350 asymptomatic military academy candidates aged 18–22, disc bulging was present in 49%, which is even higher and likely reflects selection or imaging sensitivity differences, but both datasets converge on the same conclusion that bulges are not rare in early adulthood [^168c8986].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check whether these bulges are incidental or symptomatic. Multiple systematic reviews and large cohorts show that disc bulges and other "degenerative" MRI features are common in asymptomatic individuals and increase steadily with age, underscoring that imaging abnormalities often reflect normal aging rather than a disease process in young adults [^d0646b33] [^6678cd84]. Let me reconsider the clinical implication: in people under 50, disc bulge prevalence is higher in those with back pain than in asymptomatic controls, but the absolute prevalence in asymptomatic individuals remains substantial, so a bulge at 22 is still compatible with incidental, non-causal status [^39fbe9a1].

> Next, I should review age-related trends to contextualize this. Prevalence of disc bulge rises from about 30% in 20-year-olds to over 80% by age 80 in asymptomatic cohorts, which confirms that early twenties are not exempt from degenerative changes, even if they are typically mild and multifactorial in origin [^d0646b33]. But wait, what if I'm overstating "degeneration" at 22? Even in adolescents and young adults, early disc degeneration and bulging are not rare, and genetic predisposition plus mechanical loading can accelerate these changes, so a mild bulge at 22 fits within the spectrum of early adaptive change rather than overt pathology [^e30aec31] [^d486157e].

> I should double-check the clinical relevance and when imaging changes management. Guidelines consistently advise against routine MRI for uncomplicated low back pain without red flags, precisely because incidental findings like bulges are common and can drive unnecessary interventions without improving outcomes; MRI is reserved for persistent symptoms with neurologic deficits, suspected serious pathology, or preoperative planning, so a standalone mild bulge in a 22-year-old should rarely change management by itself [^6678cd84] [^e91f9f23]. Let me verify prognosis: many disc abnormalities, including some herniations, regress or stabilize over time, and conservative care remains first-line for nonspecific low back pain regardless of MRI findings, reinforcing that a mild bulge is not a mandate for invasive treatment [^e796ea7d] [^1c6ea42e].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, it is common to have a mild disc bulge at age 22, with population data showing roughly 25–50% prevalence in asymptomatic young adults depending on the cohort and imaging protocol, and this aligns with broader evidence that degenerative MRI features begin in early adulthood and are often incidental rather than causative of pain [^6feface6] [^168c8986] [^d0646b33]. Clinically, I need to ensure we correlate symptoms, exam, and red flags before attributing pain to a bulge, avoid unnecessary imaging, and emphasize activity, core strengthening, and ergonomic optimization, reserving further workup for persistent or severe neurologic presentations [^6678cd84] [^e91f9f23].

---

It is **common** to have a mild disc bulge at age 22, with studies showing a prevalence of about 25% in asymptomatic young adults [^6feface6] and up to 49% in some cohorts [^168c8986]. Mild bulges are often **incidental and not necessarily painful** [^d0646b33]; they can reflect early degenerative changes or genetic predisposition rather than injury or disease [^d486157e]. Most mild bulges do not cause symptoms or require treatment, but persistent or severe pain should be evaluated clinically [^6678cd84].

## Prevalence of mild disc bulge in young adults

Several studies have examined the prevalence of disc bulges in asymptomatic young adults:

- **Finnish birth cohort study**: In 558 asymptomatic adults aged 20–22, 25% had at least one disc bulge, with no significant sex difference [^6feface6].
- **Italian Air Force cadets**: In 350 asymptomatic candidates aged 18–22, 49% had disc bulging, highlighting early degenerative changes in this age group [^168c8986].
- **General asymptomatic population**: Systematic reviews report disc bulge prevalence around 30% in 20-year-olds, rising with age [^d0646b33].

---

## Clinical significance of mild disc bulge

Mild disc bulges are often **asymptomatic and incidental** [^d0646b33]; when present, they may reflect early degenerative changes or genetic predisposition rather than acute injury [^d486157e]. Key points include:

- **Asymptomatic nature**: Many mild bulges are found in people without symptoms, underscoring limited clinical relevance [^d0646b33].
- **Progression risk**: Most mild bulges remain stable or regress; progression to herniation or significant symptoms is uncommon but possible [^e796ea7d].
- **Symptom correlation**: When symptoms occur, they typically reflect nerve root irritation or mechanical factors rather than the bulge alone [^a8552aec].

---

## Factors influencing disc bulge in young adults

Several factors contribute to disc bulging in young adults:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Genetic predisposition | Family history and genetic variants influence early disc degeneration [^d486157e] [^966cde09] |
| Mechanical loading | Repetitive or heavy loading, poor posture, and sedentary behavior increase risk [^f9cc2be7] [^e30aec31] |
| Lifestyle factors | Smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity are associated with early degeneration [^f9cc2be7] [^e30aec31] |
| Athletic activity | Elite athletes may have higher prevalence due to repetitive stress [^202c439b] [^8cb3969d] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Mild disc bulges at age 22 are **usually managed conservatively**:

- **Observation**: Most cases require no intervention beyond patient education and reassurance [^6678cd84].
- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, posture correction, and ergonomic adjustments can reduce symptoms and prevent progression [^notfound].
- **Pain management**: NSAIDs and activity modification are first-line for symptomatic cases [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: MRI is reserved for persistent or severe symptoms, neurological deficits, or failure of conservative care [^e91f9f23].

---

## Conclusion

Mild disc bulges are **common at age 22**, often reflecting early degenerative changes or genetic predisposition rather than injury [^6feface6] [^d486157e]. Most are asymptomatic and require no treatment, but persistent or severe symptoms warrant clinical evaluation and conservative management [^6678cd84].

### Prevalence of degenerative imaging findings in lumbar magnetic resonance imaging among young adults [^6feface6]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

A cross-sectional imaging study of young adults.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence of disc degeneration (DD) and displacement, anular tears, and Modic changes in lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among young adults.

Summary Of Background Data

Although low back pain in young adulthood is common, the prevalence of spinal MRI findings at this age remains virtually unknown.

Methods

The study population was a subcohort of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986. Subjects living within 100 km of Oulu (n = 874) were invited to participate in lumbar MRI at 20 to 22 years of age (mean: 21.2 years). Degree of DD, type of Modic changes, and presence of disc bulges, herniations, high intensity zone (HIZ) lesions, and radial tears at all lumbar levels were assessed.

Results

Three hundred twenty-five women and 233 men (n = 558) attended the MR imaging. DD was significantly more frequent in men (54% vs. 42%, P = 0.005), as was multiple DD (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.036). The prevalences of disc bulges and radial tears were 25% and 9.1%, respectively, without gender differences. HIZ lesions were more common among women than men (8.6% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.046), whereas herniations were significantly more common among men (5.6% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.047). Only 2 disc extrusions were observed, one in each gender. All degenerative disc findings were more common at the L5-S1 level except HIZ lesions, which were most likely at L4-L5. The prevalence of the Modic changes was 1.4%, without gender difference, type I being more common than type II. Typically, Modic changes were located adjacent to a DD Grade 4 disc and at the 2 lowest levels.

Conclusion

Almost half of young Finnish adult aged 21 years had at least one degenerated disc, and a quarter had a bulging disc. Modic changes and disc herniations were, however, relatively rare.

### MRI findings of disc degeneration are more prevalent in adults with low back pain than in asymptomatic controls: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^39fbe9a1]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Imaging features of spine degeneration are common in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We compared the prevalence of MR imaging features of lumbar spine degeneration in adults 50 years of age and younger with and without self-reported low back pain.

Materials and Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of degenerative lumbar spine MR imaging findings in asymptomatic and symptomatic adults 50 years of age or younger. Symptomatic individuals had axial low back pain with or without radicular symptoms. Two reviewers evaluated each article for the following outcomes: disc bulge, disc degeneration, disc extrusion, disc protrusion, annular fissures, Modic 1 changes, any Modic changes, central canal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and spondylolysis. The meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model.

Results

An initial search yielded 280 unique studies. Fourteen (5.0%) met the inclusion criteria (3097 individuals; 1193, 38.6%, asymptomatic; 1904, 61.4%, symptomatic). Imaging findings with a higher prevalence in symptomatic individuals 50 years of age or younger included disc bulge (OR, 7.54; 95% CI, 1.28-44.56; P = .03), spondylolysis (OR, 5.06; 95% CI, 1.65-15.53; P < .01), disc extrusion (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.98-9.68; P < .01), Modic 1 changes (OR, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.10-14.55; P = .04), disc protrusion (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.52-4.62; P < .01), and disc degeneration (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.21-4.15, P = .01). Imaging findings not associated with low back pain included any Modic change (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.48-5.41, P = .43), central canal stenosis (OR, 20.58; 95% CI, 0.05-798.77; P = .32), high-intensity zone (OR = 2.10; 95% CI, 0.73-6.02; P = .17), annular fissures (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 0.97-3.31; P = .06), and spondylolisthesis (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 0.78-3.24; P = .20).

Conclusions

Meta-analysis demonstrates that MR imaging evidence of disc bulge, degeneration, extrusion, protrusion, Modic 1 changes, and spondylolysis are more prevalent in adults 50 years of age or younger with back pain compared with asymptomatic individuals.

### The relationship between degree of facet tropism and amount of dynamic disc bulge in lumbar spine of patients symptomatic for low back pain [^1e55c50f]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Luoma et al. reported a significant association between self-reported sciatic pain but not non-sciatic LBP in the past 12 months with posterior disc bulge on MRI, reported as disc bulge measurements over 3.2 mm. Jensen et al. showed that while 22% of disc bulge were associated with sciatica, only 6% were associated with nerve root compression. In a recent kMRI study, Zou et al. showed that extension and flexion in the axially loaded position could reveal clinically significant disc bulges that are read as benign on conventional MRI. In another kMRI study, Zou et al. showed that disc bulge increases with disc degeneration. This study also demonstrated that with increasing disc degeneration, posterior disc bulges may increase significantly with extension, a finding supported by other studies. This suggests that with increasing disc degeneration, the possibility of disc bulge causing positional sciatic pain, especially in extension, increases. However, the extent of disc bulge required to cause nerve root compression is still unclear.

In this study, we introduced two measurements, MSB and MDB. MSB is the largest disc bulge measurement for a level from the neutral, flexion, and extension positions. Since a spinal motion segment is dynamic, MSB allows us to assess for nerve impingement potential more adequately than measurements from any single position. However, MSB may be of limited usefulness for comparison across large age ranges, because it increases with age at all levels, likely due to disc degeneration, a finding supported by other studies. MDB, however, defined as the difference between the maximal and minimal static disc bulge measurements, does not increase with age but still correlates significantly with MSB at all three levels. Since this study includes a large range of ages (16–80 years), MDB allows us to study the dynamics of disc bulge while controlling for age-related changes.

No significant differences were found at any level within the MDB categories when only the subpopulation with age <41 years was considered. Similar comparisons considering only the subpopulation with age ≥41 years found significant differences in age between the facet tropism groups in the [E – N] category, at L3–L4 (p = 0.028) and L4–L5 (p = 0.013, Table 5). No significant differences in MSB were found in any MDB category. There was a significant difference in MDB in the [E – N] category only (p = 0.049) at L4–L5, particularly between FT++ (2.03 ± 1.12) and FT− (1.32 ± 0.68, Fig. 6). There were no significant differences at the L5–S1 level, although a similar trend in age was found in the [E – N] category (p = 0.228).

### The relationship between degree of facet tropism and amount of dynamic disc bulge in lumbar spine of patients symptomatic for low back pain [^129fbf38]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Facet tropism has been defined using various methods. Cyron and Hutton defined it as bilateral angle differences of greater than 1°. Noren et al. used 5° as a cutoff. Ko and Park defined it as asymmetry greater than 1 SD at that level. Boden et al. used one definition for all levels based on percentiles of asymmetry in asymptomatic volunteers. In this study, we defined mild facet tropism as a bilateral angle positive difference between the mean (6°) and +1 SD (11°), based on the L4–L5 distribution, and severe facet tropism as a difference greater than +1 SD. Although mean facet asymmetry increases from L3–L4 to L5–S1, the distribution of facet asymmetry at those levels were not significantly different; hence, we used a single definition for all three levels. We also observed that age was associated with increased severity of facet tropism, especially in the [E – N] category, an observation also made by Kalichman et al.

The significance of disc bulge and its relationship to LBP is under debate, as there is a high prevalence of disc bulge in reportedly asymptomatic patients. In a study relating radiographic imaging and discographic findings of cadaveric lumbar discs, Yu et al. found that almost all discs with no radial tears had less than 2.5 mm disc-bulging index, while 84% of discs with radial tears had disc-bulging index greater than 2.5 mm. Thus, they suggested an association between disc bulge and annular tears, which can be a source of LBP due to their anatomical relationship with a richly innervated area of the disc. Milette et al. reported similar findings and added that disc bulges and protrusions represent discs with similar internal architecture. Stadnik et al. however, did not find a significant association. Buirski et al. also suggested that disc bulge offers little predictive value in addition to other MRI characteristics of disc degeneration to predict pain reproduced on discography, a finding shared by Milette et al. Comparison of findings from studies involving disc bulge, however, is difficult due to lack of common measurement criteria. In addition, since the measurements used by Yu et al. were from a recumbent position, it is not possible to compare them with our findings from the axially loaded position that is generally greater, even in the neutral position.

### ISSLS prize winner: prevalence, determinants, and association of schmorl nodes of the lumbar spine with disc degeneration: a population-based study of 2449 individuals [^1af039c7]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

A cross-sectional population-based magnetic resonance imaging study of Schmorl nodes (SN) in the lumbar spine.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and potential determinants of SN, and their association with intervertebral disc degeneration.

Summary Of Background Data

SN represent intravertebral disc herniation and are commonly seen in the spine. Their reported prevalence and determinants vary, and their association with disc degeneration remains uncertain. Data based on this large scale population-based study of intervertebral disc degeneration would provide important information for understanding SN and their pathomechanism.

Methods

Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imagings of the lumbar spine were analyzed in 2449 volunteers. Two independent observers assessed the images for the presence of SN, and scored for additional radiologic features (e.g., severity of degeneration, presence of disc bulge/extrusion). Subject demographics were assessed by standardized questionnaire.

Results

SN were found in 16.4% (n = 401; 219 males, 182 females; mean age = 42.3) of our study population (981 males, 1468 females; mean age = 40.4), being most common at L1/2 and L2/3 (54.1%). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that males, taller and heavier individuals had an increased likelihood of SN (P < 0.005), but association between SN and age were not discerned. Overall presence of SN was associated with disc degeneration (P < 0.001), and linearly correlated (R = 0.97) with increase in severity of degeneration. SN were particularly associated with severe disc degeneration at L1/2 and L2/3 with 22- to 15-fold increased odds, respectively (P < 0.0001), but less than 5-fold increased odds (P < 0.001) were noted in the lower lumbar spine.

Conclusion

In a population-based cohort, 16.4% of Southern Chinese subjects had SN at 1 or more lumbar levels. Males, taller and heavier individuals had increased likelihood of SN. Interestingly, SN were highly associated with severity of disc degeneration.

### The relationship between degree of facet tropism and amount of dynamic disc bulge in lumbar spine of patients symptomatic for low back pain [^a143606a]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

While studies investigating associations between facet tropism and degenerative changes are controversial, there is general agreement that any association only occurs at L4–L5, due to its greater mobility and inherent instability. We present similar findings. We further show that only the combination of both severe facet tropism and older age is associated with increased disc bulge at L4–L5, highlighting the importance of considering the role age plays in the relationship between facet tropism and degenerative changes.

We further characterized patients by MDB category, based on the positions that yielded the largest change in disc bulge. We show that at L3–L4 and L4–L5, only the group with the largest change in disc bulge between extension and neutral positions (the [E – N] category) is significantly correlated with increasing severity of facet tropism in older age. In addition, only in this category of patients is severe facet tropism at the L4–L5 level associated with increased MDB in old age. It is not completely clear what causes the largest change in disc bulge to occur between certain positions. Past studies have shown consistently that in non-degenerated discs, posterior disc surface migrates posteriorly with flexion and anteriorly with extension. In more degenerate discs, posterior disc surface migration is more unpredictable, but at L3–L4 and L4–L5, extension generally causes an increase in disc bulge measurements. Hence, degenerative changes may be partially responsible for classifying a disc in the [E – N] category at L3–L4 and L4–L5, but given the variability there are likely other, yet to be elucidated biomechanical factors responsible.

Our findings, however, suggest that at L4–L5, degenerated discs in older patients that fit in this category and occur in the presence of severe facet tropism may have similar disc bulge measurements in the neutral position as those occurring without facet tropism, but have significantly increased disc bulge in extension that may contribute to sciatic pain. Hence, in older patients who have sciatic pain correlating to L4–L5 disc degeneration and severe facet tropism, but no apparent source of pain on conventional MRI, it may be worthwhile to order kMRI to evaluate for nerve compression due to posterior disc bulging upon extension in the axially loaded position.

A limitation of this study is the lack of asymptomatic controls. To our knowledge, there are currently no studies that measure the extent of disc bulge in asymptomatic patients. We also did not assess for signs of nerve compression in this study.

### Systematic literature review of imaging features of spinal degeneration in asymptomatic populations [^d0646b33]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Degenerative changes are commonly found in spine imaging but often occur in pain-free individuals as well as those with back pain. We sought to estimate the prevalence, by age, of common degenerative spine conditions by performing a systematic review studying the prevalence of spine degeneration on imaging in asymptomatic individuals.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review of articles reporting the prevalence of imaging findings (CT or MR imaging) in asymptomatic individuals from published English literature through April 2014. Two reviewers evaluated each manuscript. We selected age groupings by decade (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years), determining age-specific prevalence estimates. For each imaging finding, we fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model for the age-specific prevalence estimate clustering in the study, adjusting for the midpoint of the reported age interval.

Results

Thirty-three articles reporting imaging findings for 3110 asymptomatic individuals met our study inclusion criteria. The prevalence of disk degeneration in asymptomatic individuals increased from 37% of 20-year-old individuals to 96% of 80-year-old individuals. Disk bulge prevalence increased from 30% of those 20 years of age to 84% of those 80 years of age. Disk protrusion prevalence increased from 29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those 80 years of age. The prevalence of annular fissure increased from 19% of those 20 years of age to 29% of those 80 years of age.

Conclusions

Imaging findings of spine degeneration are present in high proportions of asymptomatic individuals, increasing with age. Many imaging-based degenerative features are likely part of normal aging and unassociated with pain. These imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition.

### Does elite swimming accelerate lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration and increase low back pain? A cross-sectional comparison [^45c7e570]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim was to elucidate elite swimming's possible influence on lumbar disc degeneration (DD) and low back pain (LBP).

Methods

Lumbar spine MRI was performed on a group of elite swimmers and compared to a matched Finnish population-based no-sport group.

Results

One hundred elite swimmers and 96 no-sport adults, mean age 18.7/20.8, respectively, participated. Overall, the two groups had similar prevalence of DD. Swimmers had more DD in the upper lumbar spine but tended to have less DD at the lowest level. Prevalence of bulges and disc herniations were similar, but swimmers had significantly more bulges at L4-5. The swimmers reported less LBP, although not significantly (N.S.). If degenerative findings were present, the association between them and LBP was stronger in the no-sport group.

Conclusion

Elite swimmers and controls had similar prevalence of DD and LBP, although the pattern of DD differed between the groups. In case of DD, swimmers reported less LBP, although N.S.

### Effective disc age: a statistical model for age-dependent and level-specific lumbar disc degeneration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^85c715ea]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Parameter outcomes

Disc height decreased with increasing subject age, while disc width, volume, and bulge increased with increasing subject age (Table 1, Fig. S3), however, these correlations of disc geometry with age had low R 2 values. All disc geometry measures increased from the superior to inferior spine levels (Table 1, Fig. S2). MRI biomarker T2 time in the NP and NP-AF transition regions decreased with increasing age and inferior spine level (Table 1 ; Figs. 3 C, S4). The T2 time in the AF increased with increasing subject age (Table 1 ; Fig. S5).

Fig. 3 
Pfirrmann grade is significantly correlated with A subject age and B nucleus T2 relaxation time. Furthermore, the relationship between Pfirrmann grade and T2 time changes with age. C Young discs that have low T2 time also have high Pfirrmann grades, but all older discs have low T2 time and mostly high Pfirrmann grades. D The association between T2 relaxation time and Pfirrmann grade diminishes with age

Pfirrmann grade correlated with age and NP T2 time, as expected (Fig. 3 A, B and C). The relationship between Pfirrmann grade and T2 time changed with subject age. When this correlation is visualized by decade (Fig. 3 D), the decreased intercept and slope seen with increasing age decade indicates the large impact age has on both T2 time and Pfirrmann grade, which demonstrates the need for an age-dependent degeneration assessment, as developed in this study.

### The relationship between degree of facet tropism and amount of dynamic disc bulge in lumbar spine of patients symptomatic for low back pain [^e2768cf3]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Facet tropism has been investigated as a predisposing factor for degenerative changes in the lumbar spine; however, no prior study has evaluated the relationship between disc bulge and facet tropism. In this study, we used kinetic magnetic resonance imaging (kMRI) to investigate the association between degree of facet tropism and amount of disc bulge in the lumbar spine in relation to age. kMRIs in the flexion, neutral, and extension positions were performed on 410 consecutive patients with low back pain. T2-weighted midsagittal and axial mid-disc cuts were analyzed to measure disc bulge and facet angle. Facet asymmetry was calculated and classified as: no facet tropism, <6°; mild facet tropism, 6–11°; or severe facet tropism, ≥11°. Maximal static bulge (MSB), maximal dynamic bulge (MDB), and age in the facet tropism groups were compared by age subpopulations and MDB categories, defined by the positions between which the largest change in disc bulge occurs. We found the severe facet tropism group to be associated with a nearly significant increase in MSB and MDB over the no facet tropism group in the older subpopulation at the L4–L5 level only, and a larger MDB in the L4–L5 MDB category [E – N], where the greatest change in disc bulge occurs between neutral and extension positions (p = 0.013). Our findings suggest that severe facet tropism is associated with increased disc bulge at L4–L5 in only a subset of older age patients, but may in large part be due to biomechanical factors that define the [E – N] category.

### Biomechanics and mechanism of action of indirect lumbar decompression and the evolution of a stand-alone spinous process spacer [^2e278378]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spine stenosis (LSS) specifically refers to a narrowing of the neural foramina and/or the spinal canal, which compresses the nerve(s) and surrounding structures. Symptoms of LSS result from direct compression or ischemia of neural elements. Patients may present with symptoms of neurogenic claudication (pain in the buttocks or legs on walking or standing that resolves with sitting down or lumbar flexion), radicular pain, axial pain, or a combination of any of the manifestations.

Spinal stenosis is commonly classified by descriptive elements, such as etiology (i.e. degenerative or congenital), location (i.e. central, lateral, recess, foraminal, extraforaminal), and severity of the narrowing on advanced imaging (i.e. mild, moderate or severe). Degenerative lumbar stenosis results from changes in the spine that occur with aging, including facet joint hypertrophy, loss of intervertebral disc height, disc bulging, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum ; alternatively, stenosis can be caused by congenital narrowing of the spinal canal. Most cases of LSS are degenerative, resulting from changes in the spine with aging.

The addition of MILD to the array of treatment options for spinal stenosis is valuable to treating physicians as well as patients. MILD is safe and has been shown to provide durable results through 2-year follow-up. MILD does not involve the use of implants, is performed as an outpatient procedure without general anesthesia, requires only a small 5.1-mm port for access, and does not require sutures (although some surgeons elect to place a single suture at the portal site). In the comparative trial of MILD against ESIs, the success rate including durability was greater than ESIs, with a comparable safety profile.Given the minimally invasive nature of this procedure, its robust success rate, and durability of outcomes, MILD is an excellent choice for patients suffering from neurogenic claudication symptoms with LFH, who are refractory to conservative care.

While open surgery is often an excellent choice and may be required for certain patients, MILD can be offered for patients who may not tolerate a more invasive procedure, and it has a unique role as a solution when conservative therapies have failed, and the risks of more invasive approaches may not be warranted. It is important to note that MILD does not affect surgical options for the few patients who do not respond to this treatment. Because of the very minimally invasive approach and targeted subtle decompression, there is minimal or no scar tissue that would increase the risk of possible future open spine surgery. Another important consideration related to treatment planning is that patients undergoing open surgical decompression are no longer candidates for less invasive approaches.

The average age of patients in this study was 75.6 years, with patients as old as 93 years. This can be compared with an average age of 63.6 years for the surgical patients in SPORTand 66.9 and 66.2 years for the treatment and control arms, respectively, of the recent US Food and Drug Administration randomized controlled trial comparing safety and clinical outcomes of spacers.In addition, there was a high rate of presenting spinal comorbidities for MILD patients enrolled in this study (Table 1). MILD is intended for patients with central stenosis due to LFH; however, bulging discs, foraminal narrowing, and facet hypertrophy or arthrosis were common and actually were associated with higher rates of response than the ENCORE population as a whole (Table 4). Further, responder rates for patients with bulging disc and facet hypertrophy were statistically significantly higher than those without these comorbidities. Thus, our data suggest that the mere presence of these comorbidities should not be used as an exclusion.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^a8552aec]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Discogenic pain and internal disc disruption (ASIPP guidelines) are described with prevalence reported as 39% in a cohort of young patients following injury and 42% in a heterogeneous population of all age groups and types of low back pain; disc pathology begins with nuclear and/or inner annular degeneration followed by annular disruption permitting herniation, and ongoing degeneration can contribute to central canal and foraminal stenoses, segmental instability, and degenerative scoliosis; initial pathology includes decreased water content of the nucleus and fissuring of the inner annulus allowing the disc to bulge; the resulting disc morphology changes lead to altered spinal biomechanics and irritation of nerve roots by chemical irritation via an outer annular fissure near a nerve root, displacement or direct compression by disc material, or vascular compromise within canal or vascular stenoses; discogenic pain may occur without internal disc disruption, such as by chemical leakage through an outer annular fissure irritating the annulus, epidural soft tissues, and dura, and disc degeneration and herniation predispose the disc to additional pathology over time.

### The relationship between degree of facet tropism and amount of dynamic disc bulge in lumbar spine of patients symptomatic for low back pain [^da6f72a3]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Facet tropism is defined as asymmetry between the orientation angles of the right and left vertebral facet joints. In 1967, Farfan and Sullivan found that tear patterns of the posterior annulus appeared to be related to facet joint asymmetry, and that there was a high association between the side of disc herniation and the more coronally facing facet joint. Thus, they hypothesized that facet tropism is associated with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Biomechanical studies have suggested that facet tropism increases shear forces, making it a potential risk factor for low back pain (LBP) by predisposing individuals to degenerative diseases in the lumbar spine. Subsequent association studies have had conflicting results. The relationship between facet tropism with LDH and facet joint osteoarthritis is contested, while no association between disc degeneration and facet tropism has been shown.

So far, no studies have evaluated disc bulge dynamics based on the degree of facet tropism. The significance of disc bulge as a source of LBP is under continuous debate, in part due to a lack of standardized measurement criteria. While there is a high prevalence in asymptomatic individuals, disc bulge has been associated with annular radial tears and recent sciatic pain. Disc bulge has also been shown to increase with disc degeneration.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the degree of facet tropism was associated with differences in disc bulge dynamics at the L3–L4, L4–L5, and L5–S1 levels in symptomatic patients, and how age affects this association by using kinetic magnetic resonance imaging (kMRI).

### Ten-year follow-up of degenerative spinal lesions on radiographs and MRI in axial spondyloarthritis: results of the DESIR (DEvenir des spondylarthropathies indifférenciées récentes) cohort [^2e535038]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of asymptomatic subjects, cervical disc degeneration progressed in 85% of individuals over 10Y on MRI. Consistent with our study, the highest progression was reported for disc bulging/herniations. Thoracic disc degeneration on MRI progressed in 63% of subjects (mainly disc degeneration and protrusion). Similar observations have also been reported on radiographs. In agreement with our results, disc degeneration progression also seems to affect mainly the lumbar spine. Recently, a long-term prospective follow-up of young patients with LBP demonstrated that the decrease in disc signal intensity on MRI at the age of 20 years was associated with any type of DLs in the same discs/disc levels at follow-up, suggesting a predictive value of this lesion for other types of DLs.

It should be borne in mind that despite the multitude of spinal DLs, their clinical significance may be limited. Their presence is common even in patients without symptoms; conversely, some patients may suffer from back pain without any DL being observed. However, interestingly, patients with axSpA and coexisting disc degeneration have been reported to have higher functional and spinal mobility impairment.

We observed that DL progression was faster in patients with a higher BMI. Obesity is known to be associated with a higher prevalence of DLs in the general population. Although the exact mechanism is not well understood, this may be linked to a combination of mechanical (leading to higher compression and shear stresses), and metabolic (affecting the vascularisation of intervertebral discs) stresses. This finding should encourage clinicians to emphasise the importance of weight loss in cases of overweight, including in a young axSpA population.

Limitations of this study include a substantial loss to follow-up rate (inception cohort), resulting in analysis of only part of the patients initially included in the cohort. Thoracic spine radiographs were unavailable, as per the DESIR protocol. However, DL assessment on radiographs is known to be limited, and this segment was explored using MRI. Additionally, since only sagittal MRI was performed, reliable FJOA scoring was not possible, and the assessment of disc herniation was limited. Of note, the progression of individual DLs, such as an increase in their size or extent over time, has not been assessed in this study, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the dynamic changes in specific lesions. In addition, although we used standardised imaging protocols, it is possible that the scanners underwent improvements between the beginning and end of the study. Finally, no data was available on the possible symptoms associated with the DLs observed.

### Reliability of MRI findings in candidates for lumbar disc prosthesis [^40a0e7fa]. Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion of results

We found clear differences in prevalence between observers for Modic changes, HIZ and subjectively rated disc height, and smaller differences for nucleus signal and abnormal disc contour, whereas Carrino et al. found differences in frequency distributions between trained experts for disc degeneration (p = 0.055, Wald test) and facet arthropathy (p = 0.006) but not for Modic changes (p = 0.52) or HIZ (p = 0.22). No further comparable data exist. Lurie et al. found similar frequencies across readers for bulges and normal discs combined.

It is noteworthy that the difference in prevalence between observers was in a different direction for different findings and did not add up to an even larger disagreement on the MRI indication for prosthesis. For example, observer B tended to report a lower prevalence of Modic changes and ≥40% disc height decrease than observer C but a higher prevalence of HIZ and dark/black nucleus signal and thus a more similar prevalence of the overall MRI indication (Table 2).

Disagreement on prevalence might be due to differences in interpretation and the use of rating criteria. It might also be due to differences in the observers' response bias, i.e. their tendency to prefer one or another response category (to rate up or down, particularly when in doubt), independently of the characteristics of the object. Improved rating criteria might perhaps lower the number of ambiguous cases leading to differences in interpretation or response bias.

Our kappa values for interobserver and intraobserver agreement were generally similar or higher than in some prior studies for Modic changes, HIZ, nucleus pulposus signal and disc height combined and abnormal disc contour but were similar or lower for facet arthropathy. This may be partly due to non-standardized images and low prevalence of moderate/severe facet arthropathy in our sample (11.4% at L4/L5). In three studies based on standardized MRI of 40-year olds from the normal population, kappa values were slightly higher for Modic changes, HIZ and abnormal disc contour. The observers in one of these studies had read 50 pilot examinations in consensus. Overall, lumbar MRI findings show mostly moderate interobserver agreement.

### Abnormal findings on magnetic resonance images of the cervical spines in 1211 asymptomatic subjects [^62729153]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of abnormal findings on cervical spine magnetic resonance image (MRI).

Summary Of Background Data

Neurological symptoms and abnormal findings on MR images are keys to diagnose the spinal diseases. To determine the significance of MRI abnormalities, we must take into account the (1) frequency and (2) spectrum of structural abnormalities, which may be asymptomatic. However, no large-scale study has documented abnormal findings of the cervical spine on MR image in asymptomatic subjects.

Methods

MR images were analyzed for the anteroposterior spinal cord diameter, disc bulging diameter, and axial cross-sectional area of the spinal cord in 1211 healthy volunteers. The age of healthy volunteers prospectively enrolled in this study ranged from 20 to 70 years, with approximately 100 individuals per decade, per sex. These data were used to determine the spectrum and degree of disc bulging, spinal cord compression (SCC), and increased signal intensity changes in the spinal cord.

Results

Most subjects presented with disc bulging (87.6%), which significantly increased with age in terms of frequency, severity, and number of levels. Even most subjects in their 20s had bulging discs, with 73.3% and 78.0% of males and females, respectively. In contrast, few asymptomatic subjects were diagnosed with SCC (5.3%) or increased signal intensity (2.3%). These numbers increased with age, particularly after age 50 years. SCC mainly involved 1 level (58%) or 2 levels (38%), and predominantly occurred at C5-C6 (41%) and C6-C7 (27%).

Conclusion

Disc bulging was frequently observed in asymptomatic subjects, even including those in their 20s. The number of patients with minor disc bulging increased from age 20 to 50 years. In contrast, the frequency of SCC and increased signal intensity increased after age 50 years, and this was accompanied by increased severity of disc bulging.

### High prevalence of spinal magnetic resonance imaging findings in asymptomatic young adults (18-22 yrs) candidate to air force flight [^168c8986]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional, retrospective, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study, performed during cadets' selection procedures of the Italian Air Force Academy.

Objective

To assess the prevalence of spinal MR imaging findings in asymptomatic young adults (18-22 yrs) candidate to Air Force Flight.

Summary Of Background Data

Spinal MR imaging findings are frequently detected in asymptomatic subjects. Literature prevalence data come from studies that analyze different patient populations, in a wide age range and in different spinal tracts. Chronic degenerative disease of the vertebral column often occurs in pilots exposed to high flight acceleration forces, thus resulting crucial for Air Force Academy to exclude vertebral disease in cadets.

Methods

Three hundred fifty asymptomatic young adults underwent a 3T MR examination of the entire spine. A structured radiological report was set up to classify and calculate the prevalence of spinal MR imaging findings.

Results

Two hundred seventy of 350 subjects (77%) presented spinal MR findings, while 80 of 350 candidates (23%) had no detectable MR imaging findings. One hundred six of 350 (30%) candidates had at least one disc desiccation and 47 of 350 (13%) presented at least one disc narrowing. Disc bulging was found in 176 of 350 (49%) cadets. Sixty-two of 350 (18%) subjects showed disc protrusion while 28 of 350 (8%) had disc extrusion. Forty-five of 350 (13%) candidates presented low grade intervertebral spondylosis and of these 12 had also facet joints spondylosis. Asymptomatic vertebral fractures were observed in 2 of 350 (<1%) cadets.

Conclusion

A high rate of MR spinal imaging findings, similar to that of the adult population, was detected in our population of young asymptomatic subjects. Our results suggest that the process of aging spine, which is supposed to begin in the second decade of life, is morphologically appreciable in the immediate postadolescent period and this issue is of crucial importance when selecting military pilots.

### Adolescent disc degeneration – no headache association [^d78aec07]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether adolescents with headache have more disc degeneration in the cervical spine than headache-free controls. This study is part of a population-based follow-up study of adolescents with and without headache. At the age of 17 years, adolescents with headache at least three times a month (N = 47) and adolescents with no headache (N = 22) participated in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the cervical spine. Of the 47 headache sufferers, 17 also had weekly neck pain and 30 had neck pain less than once a month. MRI scans were interpreted independently by three neuroradiologists. Disc degeneration was found in 67% of participants, with no difference between adolescents with and without headache. Most of the degenerative changes were located in the lower cervical spine. In adolescence, mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine are surprisingly common but do not contribute to headache.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^b76f3ef9]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality often used to depict spinal structural abnormalities that may cause low back pain (LBP). With its high soft tissue contrast, MRI allows assessment of multiple structures including intervertebral discs, nerve roots, contents of the central spinal canal, ligaments and facet joints. While MRI is superb at identifying tissue-specific pathology along the spine, the clinical relevance of these findings is often uncertain. Thus, diagnostic MRI for LBP is only recommended in certain patients. The American College of Physicians’ guidelines for diagnostic imaging suggest immediate imaging when there are major risks (such as suspicion of cancer, spinal infection, cauda equina syndrome, or presence of severe neurological deficits), but advise deferral of imaging pending a trial of treatment in cases where there are weaker risk factors. Notably, only in a minority of patients can LBP be attributed to a specific pathology (e.g. vertebral fracture or disc herniation with nerve compression), while the great majority of patients are assigned a diagnosis of non-specific LBP (i.e. pain for which the distinct patho-anatomical basis cannot be determined).

Some lumbar MRI findings that are common in patients with LBP are also common in asymptomatic subjects, which makes it difficult to define a causal relationship in individual patients and has led to questions about the diagnostic value of such findings. However, some lumbar MRI findings are more prevalent in patients with LBP than in asymptomatic subjects. Those include bone marrow (BM) lesions located at the vertebral endplates, disc bulges and herniation, and spondylolysis. Such lumbar MRI findings could potentially function as biomarkers that can distinguish patients whose pain is due to a primary nociceptive process in the spine from patients with central modulating mechanisms that can be influenced by a number of psychosocial factors as well as central sensitization (i.e. increased responsiveness of nociceptors to either normal or sub-threshold afferent input, resulting in amplified pain).

### A pilot study of the prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration in elite athletes with lower back pain at the sydney 2000 olympic games [^202c439b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To observe the prevalence of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration in elite athletes as compared with published literature of changes seen in non-athletes-that is, normal population.

Methods

The lumbar spines of 31 Olympic athletes who presented to the Olympic Polyclinic with low back pain and/or sciatica were examined using magnetic resonance imaging. Three criteria were looked at: (a) the loss of disc signal intensity; (b) the loss of disc height; (c) the presence of disc displacement. The results were then recorded and correlated with the lumbar levels.

Results

The disc signal intensity was progressively reduced the more caudal the disc space. It was most common at the L5/S1 level, and, of the abnormal group, 36% (n = 11) showed the most degenerative change. Disc height reduction was also found to be most common at the L5/S1 level. However, the most common height reduction was only mild. A similar trend of increased prevalence of disc herniation was noted with more caudal levels. At the L5/S1 level, 58% were found to have an element of disc displacement, most of which were disc bulges. Compared with changes seen in the normal population (non-athletes) as described in the literature, disc degeneration defined by the above criteria was found to be significantly more severe in these Olympic athletes.

Conclusions

Although the study was limited, the results suggest that elite athletes have a greater prevalence and greater degree of lumbar disc degeneration than the normal population. A more detailed follow up study should be considered to investigate which particular training activities have the most impact on the lumbar spine, and how to modify training methods so as to avoid the long term sequelae of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine.

### Are "structural abnormalities" on magnetic resonance imaging a contraindication to the successful conservative treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain? [^d2a61631]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective study.

Objective

To examine the association between structural abnormalities recorded on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outcome after evidence-based conservative treatment in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP).

Summary Of Background Data

In most guidelines for the management of LBP, MRI is not recommended unless the diagnostic triage suggests serious spinal pathology or nerve root involvement for which surgical treatment is foreseen. This is because many structural changes seen on MRI appear to be as common in asymptomatic individuals as in people with LBP and are, therefore, considered of little value in either explaining the cause of pain or deciding the subsequent course of management. However, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed whether the presence of such MRI abnormalities influences the outcome of the conservative treatment that patients with chronic nonspecific LBP typically receive.

Methods

T2-weighted, 4-mm spin-echo MRI sequences of the lumbar spine were obtained from 53 patients with chronic nonspecific LBP before a 3-month program of exercise therapy. Disc degeneration, disc bulging, high intensity zones, and endplate/bone marrow changes were assessed for each lumbar segment. Back pain (average and worst) and disability (Roland Morris score) were assessed before and after therapy, and 12 months later, and the improvements were examined in relation to the presence or absence of baseline MRI "abnormalities."

Results

Eighty-nine percent of patients had severe disc degeneration (grade 4 or 5), 74% had disc bulging, 60% had high intensity zones, and 62% had endplate/bone marrow changes in at least 1 lumbar segment. Only 11% patients had none of these changes at any level. The MRI abnormalities showed only minimal association with baseline symptoms. In multivariate regression analyses, in which age, gender, and baseline symptoms were controlled for, only 1 significant association between the MRI variables and outcome was observed: the presence of a high intensity zone in any vertebral segment was associated with lower average pain at the 12-month follow-up (standardized beta -0.376, P = 0.006, 16.5% variance accounted for).

Conclusion

In the patient group examined, the presence of common "structural abnormalities" on MRI had no significant negative influence on the outcome after therapy.

### The prevalence of degenerative or incidental findings in the lumbar spine of pediatric patients: a study using magnetic resonance imaging as a screening tool [^d47a84df]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Several studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the lumbar spine in adults have shown a large prevalence of degenerative changes in asymptomatic subjects; however, studies in pediatric patients are scarce. Those studies have suggested a lower rate of degenerative findings in adolescents than in adults, but the actual prevalence of MRI findings in the pediatric population has not yet been determined. We aimed to determine the prevalence of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine of pediatric patients using abdominal and pelvic MRI as the screening tool.

Methods

We studied 103 patients (mean age 6.6 years) who were evaluated with abdominal and pelvic MRI for indications that were not spine related. The entire lumbo-sacral spine was evaluated to detect the presence of disc degeneration (DD), disc displacement, anular rupture with high-intensity zone (HIZ) and Modic changes.

Results

In our population, 10.7 % [4.9-16.5] had at least one disc classified as Pfirrmann 2, and no patients presented discs classified as Pfirrmann 3, 4 or 5; patients exhibiting discs classified as Pfirrmann 2 were significantly older than patients who had only Pfirrmann 1 discs. The prevalence of disc bulging was 1 % [0-2.9]. No patients presented disc herniation (including protrusion or extrusions); additionally, no patients exhibited HIZ or Modic changes.

Conclusions

Incidental findings related to DD are very uncommon at this early age, in contrast to findings described in adults or later in adolescence.

### Does lumbar disc degeneration on magnetic resonance imaging associate with low back symptom severity in young Finnish adults? [^0955fe87]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

A cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging study with questionnaires on low back pain (LBP) and functional limitations.

Objective

To investigate the association between lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (DD) and low back symptom severity among young Finnish adults.

Summary Of Background Data

Both LBP and lumbar DD are common already in adolescence, but very little is known of their association in young adults.

Methods

Young adults belonging to a birth cohort (n=874) were invited to lumbar magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-T scanner. Data on LBP and functional limitations at the ages of 18, 19, and 21 years were used to cluster the subjects with respect to low back symptoms using latent class analysis. The prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of DD at 21 years and the sum score of DD at all lumbar levels were compared between the clusters. The contribution of DD and other imaging findings (herniations, anular tears, Modic changes, spondylolytic defects) to symptom severity was analyzed with logistic regression analysis.

Results

Latent class analysis produced five clusters from the 554 subjects, ranging from a cluster where subjects (n=65) had been painful at all time points to an asymptomatic cluster (n=168). DD was more prevalent in the three most symptomatic clusters compared to the two least symptomatic ones. Similar findings were obtained for the DD sum scores. Lumbar DD was related to symptom severity independently of other degenerative findings. Moreover, moderately degenerated discs were more likely than mildly degenerated discs to be associated with the most severe low back symptoms.

Conclusion

Intervertebral DD was associated with low back symptom severity among young adults, suggesting that the symptoms may have a discogenic origin at this age. However, DD was also found in one-third of asymptomatic subjects.

### The prevalence of MRI-defined spinal pathoanatomies and their association with modic changes in individuals seeking care for low back pain [^edbc7b85]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Modic changes are of increasing interest, however their age and gender prevalence are not well described. To date, the associations between Modic changes and other common vertebral pathologies have only been described in small samples (n < 100). Our aim was, in a large dataset of people with low back pain, to (1) describe the prevalence of a range of spinal pathoanatomies, and (2) examine the association between Modic changes and stages of intervertebral disc (IVD) pathology. Common pathologies were coded from the lumbar spine MRIs from 4,233 consecutive people imaged while attending a publicly-funded secondary care outpatient facility in Denmark. Prevalence data were calculated by pathology and by vertebral level. Prevalence was also calculated by age and gender categories for Modic changes. The association between stages of IVD pathology (degeneration, bulge, herniation) and Modic changes at L4/5 and L5/S1 was expressed using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals. The prevalence of Modic changes and IVD pathology were greater in L4/5 and L5/S1, compared with the upper lumbar spine. There was no significant gender difference in prevalence of Modic changes (p = 0.11). The prevalence of IVD disc pathology occurring concurrently with Modic changes ranged from 11.5 to 17.5% (Type 1), 8.5 to 12.7% (Type 2) and 17.1 to 25.6% (Type 1 and/or 2) while the prevalence occurring in the absence of Modic changes ranged from 0.5 to 6.3% (Type 1), 0.3 to 4.9 (Type 2), 0.8 to 9.7% (Type 1 and/or 2). The associated PR for IVD pathology occurring concurrently with Modic changes ranged from 1.8 to 29.2 (p < 0.05). The highest PR (29.2) was between degeneration and Modic changes, indicating that it is rare for Modic changes to occur without disc degeneration. Spinal pathoanatomy was common in this population, particularly IVD pathologies, and a consistent trend of a relatively greater prevalence in the lower lumbar spine was identified. Modic changes were more likely to be present among individuals with IVD pathology than without, which may implicate mechanical factors as being one aetiological pathway for Modic changes, although other hypotheses may equally explain this association.

### Five reasons why some herniated intervertebral discs are painless [^2a837fdc]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD) refers to the rupture of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc, leading to the herniation of the nucleus pulposus beyond the intervertebral disc space.It is caused by a sudden back injury or by gradual wear and tear of the disc (ie disc degeneration).HIVDs induce lower back and lumbosacral radicular pain in the lower extremities and are a common cause of musculoskeletal pain.The prevalence of symptomatic HIVDs in the general population is known to be 1–3%.A diagnosis of an HIVD is confirmed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). However, despite clear findings of an HIVD on MRI or CT, many HIVDs do not cause pain.Jensen et al reported that only 36% of 98 asymptomatic patients had normal discs at all levels on MRI, with 52% showing a bulging disc at least at one level and 27% with a disc herniation. Here, we propose five reasons why some HIVDs do not induce pain.

### Spine abnormalities depicted by magnetic resonance imaging in adolescent rowers [^322dc958]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Most lesions of the spine of athletes, which often are detected incidentally, do not cause important symptoms or make the athletes discontinue their physical activities. To better understand the significance of these lesions, new imaging studies have been conducted with asymptomatic athletes in several sports, aiming to detect potentially deleterious and disabling abnormalities.

Purpose

To compare the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lumbar spine findings in a group of asymptomatic adolescent rowers and in a control group of adolescents matched according to age and sex who do not practice any regular physical activity.

Study Design

Cohort study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Our study evaluated 44 asymptomatic adolescent boys distributed in 2 groups of 22 rowers and 22 control subjects. All the examinations were performed using a 0.35-T open-field MRI unit and evaluated by 2 experienced radiologists blinded to the study groups. Each MRI scan was analyzed for the presence of disc degeneration/desiccation, herniated or bulging disc, pars interarticularis stress reaction, and spondylolysis. The Student t test and the Fisher exact test were used for statistical analyses.

Results

Nine rowers (40.9%) had at least 1 abnormality detected by MRI in the lumbar spine, whereas only 2 participants (9.1%) in the control group had at least 1 MRI abnormality (P = .03). Seven disc changes (31.8%) and 6 pars abnormalities (27.3%) were found in the group of elite rowers. In the control group, 3 disc changes (13.6%) and no pars abnormalities were found in the MR scans. The comparison between groups showed statistically significant differences in stress reaction of the pars articularis.

Conclusion

Disc disease and pars interarticularis stress reaction are prevalent abnormalities of the lumbar spine of high-performance rowers.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^6678cd84]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The evidence for change

Evidence from randomised controlled trials has established that imaging does not improve clinical outcomes, and several observational studies have linked liberal imaging with greater work absence and unnecessary use of health services.Unnecessary LBP imaging has the potential for harm. Perhaps the most obvious of these harms is exposure to radiation from x rays and computed tomography. Harm is also possible if a clinician acts on incidental findings from any imaging method, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or if these findings are not appropriately explained to patients. For example, disc abnormalities such as bulging disc or degenerative disc disease are commonly seen on images but may not be the source of pain, as they are also seen on images in up to 97% of asymptomatic patients (table 1).Incidental findings may lead to further investigations, specialist referral, and more intensive treatment such as surgery, which limits access to those services for the patients who are in genuine need of such care.Incidental findings may also provoke worry or concern in patients from a labelling effect (possibly delaying recovery) if they fail to understand that these anomalies are common and benign.

Table 1 
Age-specific prevalence estimates of degenerative spine imaging findings in asymptomatic people

Imaging and follow-up based on incidental findings affects the health system in terms of direct costs (such as cost of equipment, staff time to conduct the imaging, and time to interpret the image findings) and downstream costs (subsequent tests, referrals, and interventions, many of which are expensive and are of limited benefit for most patients with back pain). The downstream costs of imaging also affect patients and society due to indirect costs relating to out of pocket expenses for unnecessary interventions, as well as expenses related to lost work or household productivity.Two systematic reviews of six randomised controlled trials (1804 participants) both concluded that patients who received imaging without a clear clinical indication did not have improvements to pain, function, or quality of life compared with those who did not have imaging.Additionally, observational studies have found that those who received imaging when not indicated had greater use of health services such as injections and surgery and greater work absence than their counterparts who did not receive imaging.For example, a 2020 study of 405 965 US primary care patients found that those who had early MRI were more likely to undergo back surgery (1.48% v 0.12%) and take prescription opioids (35.1% v 28.6%), yet had higher pain score at 1-year follow-up (3.99 v 3.87) than those who did not get early MRI.

Table 5. 
Intervertebral disc changes

Furthermore, location and morphology of disc herniation is classified according to shape characteristics, including bulge, protrusion, and extrusion. Specifically, bulge is defined as annular tissue that projects beyond the margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies, affecting more than 90° of circumference. A disc protrusion is a focal herniation of disc material beyond the margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies (over less than 90° of circumference and with a base that is wider than the dome). In addition, a disc extrusion is a focal herniation of disc nuclear material through an annular defect (remaining in continuity with the disc and with a base narrower than the dome). Additionally, the absence or presence of an annular fissure and its location is taken into consideration, which is commonly characterized by a zone of high signal on T2-weighted images at the lateral edges of the annulus (Table 5). Example cases for degenerative disc disease are provided by Figures 3 and 4.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^1c6ea42e]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

Conservative treatment is considered a first-line treatment for the majority of patients with degenerative spine disease, unless the disease presents with acute neurological symptoms such as myelopathy or cauda equine syndrome. When medical therapy fails, imaging and spinal surgery are considered as the next step of management. Depending on the prevalent degenerative pattern, different surgical approaches can be utilised. Patients with symptomatic disc herniations can benefit from microdiscectomy. If a degenerative process results in destabilisation and abnormal spinal motion, different types of surgical fusion can be used to stabilise the spine. Interbody fusion implants are widely used to restore disc height and support the anterior column. Spondylotic changes usually do not require surgery (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24 
Surgical treatment options for degenerative changes. (a) Herniations. Herniations are often associated with pain and neurological symptoms and most commonly occur on the lumbar spine. Treatment options include conservative treatment if the herniation does not compress the nerves and surgical removal of the herniation if neural compression exists. (b) Spondylosis. Chronic longstanding disc degeneration results in slowly progressive mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and gradual osteophyte formation without apparent disc displacement. Spondylosis is considered an adaptive reaction to stabilise motion in the presence of instability or a compensatory mechanism to limit the range of motion and prevent further degeneration. Altered disc biomechanics and narrowed intervertebral disc space subsequently lead to facet joint degeneration. This is probably the most favourable type of degeneration as it is essentially asymptomatic, may be seen at all levels of the spine and typically does not require treatment. (c) Disc collapse. Disc collapse leads to annular folding, anterior bulging of the flaval ligaments and posterior bulging of the posterior longitudinal ligament, with consequential narrowing of the central spinal canal. The decreasing disc height of the involved spinal segment leads to increased stiffness and may cause vertical degeneration of the adjacent vertebral segments. (d) Progressive structural failure of the disc to maintain the integrity of the functional spinal unit leads to segmental instability. This may progress to degenerative spondylolysthesis and require spinal instrumentation

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adult isthmic spondylolisthesis [^037d269c]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult isthmic spondylolisthesis—MRI and myelography observational evidence includes Annertz et al, in which “Seventeen patients, including 9 men and 8 women with a mean age of 41, underwent conventional radiography and MRI of the lumbar spine. Thirteen patients also received myelogram,” with disc space reduction “in 9 of the 17 patients” “estimated to exceed 50%” and vertebral slipping “from 5 to 25 mm.” Myelography showed waist-like dural sac deformation and bilateral root sleeve shortening “in 5 of the 13 patients,” was “normal” in “4 patients,” and often had minimal nerve root influence despite severe olisthesis, while MRI showed reactive vertebral changes “in eight cases,” complete disc space reduction without protrusion “in 2 patients,” a posterolateral bulge “in 14 patients,” and symmetric protrusion “not exceeding 5 mm” in “four patients.” Across “38 foramina,” MRI categorized nerves as “normal nerve (n=8); compressed nerve (n=16); disappearance of fat and nerve not possible to identify (n=9),” leading authors to note myelography “was of limited value” and that the study provides “Level III” evidence that “MR imaging provides superior imaging of the nerve root compared to myelography”; “post myelogram CT was not performed.” A second study by Jinkins et al “conducted a prospective radiographic analysis” using MRI “in 15 consecutive patients” with assessments “blinded to the patients’ clinical history,” defining impingement as “circumferential or pincer-like entrapment of the nerve root and obliteration of the perineural fat,” and diagnosing radiculopathy by electromyography or dermatomal lower-extremity pain.

### MRI findings in the lumbar spines of asymptomatic, adolescent, elite tennis players [^8cb3969d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the lumbar spine in asymptomatic elite adolescent tennis players, to serve as the baseline for a future prospective longitudinal cohort study.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Institutional, national tennis centre.

Participants

33 asymptomatic elite adolescent tennis players, mean (SD) age, 17.3 (1.7) years (18 male, 15 female).

Methods

Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, and axial T2 weighted MRI images were reviewed for the presence of abnormalities by two radiologists in consensus. Abnormalities included disc degeneration, disc herniation, pars lesions (fracture or stress reaction), and facet joint arthropathy.

Results

Five players (15.2%) had a normal MRI examination and 28 (84.8%) had an abnormal examination. Nine players showed pars lesions (10 lesions; one at two levels) predominately at the L5 level (9/10, L5; 1/10, L4). Three of the 10 lesions were complete fractures; two showed grade 1 and one grade 2 spondylolisthesis, both of which resulted in moderate narrowing of the L5 exit foramen. There were two acute and five chronic stress reactions of the pars. Twenty three patients showed signs of early facet arthropathy occurring at L5/S1 (15/29 joints) and L4/5 (12/29 joints). These were classified as mild degeneration (20/29) and moderate degeneration (9/29), with 20/29 showing sclerosis and 24/29 showing hypertrophy of the facet joint. Synovial cysts were identified in 14 of the 29 joints. Thirteen players showed disc desiccation and disc bulging (mild in 13; moderate in two) most often at L4/5 and L5/S1 levels (12 of 15 discs).

Conclusions

Abnormalities were frequent, predominately in the lower lumbar spine, almost exclusively at L4/5 and L5/S1 levels. Pars injuries and facet joint arthroses were relatively common.

### Study of the distribution of lumbar modic changes in patients with low back pain and correlation with lumbar degeneration diseases [^a938c8ab]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study the distribution of lumbar Modic changes (MC) in low back pain patients, and to explore the relationship between Modic changes and age, gender, segment and lumbar degeneration diseases (disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, lumbar spondylolisthesis).

Patients and Methods

Modic changes were counted and analysed in 500 randomly selected patients who visited the outpatient clinic for lumbar spine MRI for low back pain from 2019 to 2022. The relationship between Modic changes and bulging disc, protrusion, extrusion, sequestration, Schmorl’s node, spinal stenosis, and lumbar spondylolisthesis was studied. Data correlations were compared using the chi-square test, P<0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.

Results

Modic changes were present in 184 segments. 58 were type I, 119 were type II, and 7 were type III. The number of Modic changes segments in L1-2, L2-3, L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 was 10, 22, 22, 58, and 72, respectively. Modic changes by gender occurred in 44 males and 82 females, and by age grouping were 0 cases in 10–19 years, 3 cases in 20–29 years, 6 cases in 30–39 years, 41 cases in 40–49 years, 64 cases in 50–59 years, 38 cases in 60–69 years, 15 cases in 70–79 years, and 5 cases in 80–89 years, respectively. Modic changes occurred in 56 with bulging disc, 45 with Protrusion, 57 with Extrusion and Sequestration, 32 with Schmorl’s node, 32 with spondylolisthesis, and 56 with stenosis. Modic changes correlated with all of the above factors except bulging disc, and all differences were statistically significant (P<0.05).

Conclusion

The most common type of Modic changes is type II; Modic changes have correlation with age, gender, segment, lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spondylolisthesis, and lumbar spinal stenosis, and are a very important factor in low back pain.

### Effective disc age: a statistical model for age-dependent and level-specific lumbar disc degeneration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^a007aced]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, this study established a statistical model of effective disc age to assess disc health based on NP T2 time, subject height, and disc geometry. The model addresses limitations in existing grading schemes, which do not account for age effects or spine level and are qualitative, subjective, and ordinal. The difference between effective disc age and a subjects’ true age distinguishes predictable degeneration, normal aging (effective disc age ≈ true age), from potentially accelerated degeneration (effective disc age > true age), with the latter being much less common and possibly having a greater likelihood of present or future pathology. The statistical model for effective disc age fills a critical need for an age-dependent degeneration assessment, with the potential to impact many clinical and research applications.

### Progression and determinants of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measures of lumbar disc degeneration: a five-year follow-up of adult male monozygotic twins [^f9cc2be7]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A longitudinal study.

Objective

Our goal was to explore the role of digital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, by extending our earlier 5-year follow-up study of progression of lumbar spine degeneration with quantitative measures of disc degeneration.

Summary Of Background Data

A longitudinal study is optimal for investigating disc degeneration but only a few studies (with small sample sizes) or short follow-up studies include repeated MRI data.

Methods

Subjects consisted of 134 male monozygotic twins (age 35-69 years). Quantitative MRI measures included changes in disc bulging and height. Inter-rater reliability coefficients were between 0.77 and 0.96. At baseline and follow-up, an extensive interview about exposures to suspected determinants was conducted.

Results

Reduction in disc height and increases in bulges (worsening) were seen in 2/3 of subjects. The mean reduction in disc height was 2.2% to 3.6%. A mean increase in bulging of 7% to 10% was found in the L1-L4 discs and 4% in L4-S1 discs. Although the mean changes were small, few reverse changes were observed. Familial aggregation, a proxy for genetic influences, explained 17% of changes in disc height, and 11% and 0% of changes in the sizes of anterior and posterior bulges in the regression models. Higher maximal occupational lifting (AR2 = 4.9%) and smoking (AR2 = 3.5%) during follow-up predicted more disc height reduction. Greater increases in bulging (AR2 = 7.4%-10.2%) were predicted by smaller bulges at baseline.

Conclusion

The mean annual changes in disc heights (<1%) and bulges (<2%) were small, and included both decreases and increases, with only a few subjects showing more major changes in either direction. The role of genetics was largest except in posterior bulges, but lifting and smoking were also associated with disc height reduction but none of the other studied risk factors were associated with anterior or posterior disc bulging. Different degenerative findings have different determinants of progression.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^7fd65050]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Degeneration of the intervertebral disk – as a cause of pain

The intervertebral discs in the cervical spine undergo age-related degeneration, leading to structural changes and clinical symptoms, such as cervical region pain exacerbated by movement. Aging reduces the water content in the nucleus pulposus, subsequent protrusion or extrusion can irritate local neural structures, serving as a potential neurological pain source in the cervical region. Progressive IVD changes lead to an unequal distribution of forces across the endplates, resulting in the remodelling of the adjacent vertebral bodies. These changes include increased anteroposterior length of the vertebrae, decreased intervertebral height, osteophytes, and bone spur formation. IVD degeneration can also have downstream consequences such as ligamentous changes, and cervical alignment adverse alterations including the development of kyphosis, scoliosis, hyperlordosis, or listhesis. All of these changes can individually or collectively be often associated with pain. It is important to note that not everyone with degenerative changes in the spine will experience pain. Some people may have degenerative changes on imaging without any accompanying symptoms. Additionally, pain can be influenced by various factors such as the extent of degeneration, overall health and lifestyle, cultural factors, and individual pain thresholds.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^e91f9f23]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP)—imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be “abnormal” by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### Age-dependent microstructural changes of the intervertebral disc: a validation of proteoglycan-sensitive spectral CT [^4abfb320]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration commonly occurs in the aging spine, often leading to degenerative disc disease (DDD) with low back pain. The intervertebral disc connects two vertebral bodies and consists of cartilaginous and fibrous elements—the central nucleus pulposus (NP) and the surrounding anulus fibrosus. Collagen and proteoglycans such as chondroitin are the main biochemical components of the disc and are thought to play a significant role in the development of DDD.

Microstructural alteration of IVDs may occur before obvious morphological change becomes apparent and is attributed to reorganization of the extracellular matrix. Importantly, imaging features of degeneration such as disc bulging, disc protrusion, and annular fissure also occur in asymptomatic individuals and increasingly with advanced age. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current reference standard for assessment of spinal conditions involving soft tissue with excellent morphological depiction of the IVD and early degenerative changes. MRI provides additional information when sequences such as glycosaminoglycan chemical exchange saturation transfer (gagCEST) are used. However, several contraindications limit the use of MRI in patients, with an ongoing debate about cardiac implants.

Another diagnostic modality to assess for discogenic pain would be provocative discography, with contrast application after placing a needle in the IVD. This procedure has been proven to be a safe and accurate diagnostic procedure. Imaging findings of DDD are not only prevalent in symptomatic individuals but also highly prevalent among asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, provocative discography, performed according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria, remains the most specific procedure to diagnose discogenic low back pain.

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) may facilitate depiction of the characteristic properties of collagen with relatively high attenuation of the densely packed fibers and a relatively low effective atomic number, thus improving visualization of tendons, ligaments, and other collagen-rich structures. Recent studies suggest that DECT is also useful in depicting the morphology and microstructural changes of IVDs. Additionally, virtual non-calcium (VnCa) maps have been shown to increase diagnostic performance and confidence for depicting lumbar disc herniation as compared with standard CT. However, a systematic analysis of quantitative and qualitative aspects has yet to be conducted.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze major components of the IVD in a phantom setup using DECT and to determine whether the results may be transferred to age-related changes of IVD microstructure in patients.

### Ten-year follow-up of degenerative spinal lesions on radiographs and MRI in axial spondyloarthritis: results of the DESIR (DEvenir des spondylarthropathies indifférenciées récentes) cohort [^b831c6d5]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides insight into the course of DLs throughout the spine on radiographs and MRI in an inception cohort of axSpA over a 10Y follow-up period. Their prevalence is high, even in these young patients, however, their change over 10Y is limited. The most common DL in the study was disc height loss on radiographs and disc degeneration on MRI. At baseline, the cervical and lumbar spines were predominantly involved. With ageing this increases, and the thoracic spine was also affected on MRI. The most significant DL progression concerned osteophytes on radiographs and disc bulging/herniation on MRI. Nevertheless, it remained modest, around 1% per year for most lesions, except for osteophytes, which showed the highest progression at 2% per year. Factors associated with an increase in the number of DLs over time in both modalities were increased BMI and bDMARDs exposure, the latter probably indicating a more severe form of axSpA.

This study is important because, to our knowledge, it is the first to assess spinal DL progression in a large population of young patients with axSpA on both radiographs and MRI. DLs are common in the spine, observed not only in subjects without axSpA, but also in patients with axSpA. Although there are significant variations in the prevalence of DLs (differences in population age structure, and imaging acquisition methods, with most studies focusing only on the lumbar segment), those reported in this study appear to be in line with the prevalence published in the general population. For example, in previous studies among patients under 50, lumbar disc degeneration ranged from 34% to 84%, and lumbar disc protrusion from 19% to 47%, compared to 86% and 46% respectively in our study (baseline, whole spine). In a study involving 84 individuals (mean age: 38.5 years; 59% with chronic low back pain (LBP)) DLs were found in 52% on radiographs, similar to 53% in our study. As observed here, the most frequent lesions in previous axSpA studies were disc height loss (21–34%) and osteophytes (13–26%) on radiographs; these were disc degeneration (42–63%), HIZ (23–65%) and Schmorl’s node without oedema (38–63%) on MRI. These lesions predominated in the lumbar spine.

### Association between vertebral cross-sectional area and lumbar disc displacement-a population-based study [^baf9eac2]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Vertebral dimensions may constitute a potential risk factor for degenerative changes in the spine. Previous studies have found a positive association between vertebral height and both type 2 Modic changes and intervertebral disc height loss. Also, vertebral endplate size has been associated with disc degeneration. However, only a few studies have investigated the association between vertebral dimensions and lumbar disc displacement (LDD). This study aimed to investigate the association between vertebral cross-sectional area (CSA) and LDD among the general middle-aged Finnish population. We hypothesized that larger vertebral CSA is associated with LDD.

Materials and Methods

The study was conducted by using data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). At the age of 46, a subpopulation of NFBC1966 underwent clinical examinations including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=1249). MRI scans were used to measure L4 CSA and evaluate the presence of LDD (bulge, protrusion, and extrusion/sequestration) in the adjacent discs. The association between L4 CSA and LDD was analysed using logistic regression, with adjustment for sex, education, body mass index, leisure-time physical activity, smoking, diet, and L4 height.

Results

Larger L4 CSA was associated with LDD; an increase of 1 cm 2 in vertebral CSA elevated the odds of LDD relative to no LDD by 10% (adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19). The association was similar among either sex.

Conclusions

Larger L4 vertebral CSA was associated with LDD in our study sample. Even though smaller vertebral size exposes our vertebrae to osteoporotic fractures, it simultaneously seems to protect us from LDD.

### Inflammatory changes of the lumbar spine in children and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis: magnetic resonance imaging findings [^10b27a99]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Discs and end plates

Intervertebral disc and end-plate changes were seen in 26 (45%) of 58 cases with ERA. Purely mechanical changes, i.e. disc desiccation, were present in 12 cases, and in 3 of these, disc desiccation was the only abnormality of the lumbar spine. Eighteen cases had end-plate defects (Schmorl's nodes) and 4 of these were edematous. Marginal end-plate edema was present in 4 of 58 cases. All 4 patients had associated sacroiliitis and inflammatory changes of the apophyseal joints and/or the posterior elements.

Controls

The most prevalent abnormality in the control group was changes in the intervertebral discs. No control patient showed definite sacroiliitis; 18 controls had normal SI joints and 3 had indeterminate changes.

Apophyseal joints

Apophyseal joint synovitis (grade 1) was present in 1 of 21 controls.

Posterior elements

Only 1 control patient showed intense enhancement of the interspinous ligaments. Another control showed a small focus of edema in a lumbar spinous process and this was considered to be indeterminate. A blush of enhancement in the interspinous ligaments was seen in 7 (33%) of 21 controls.

Discs and end plates

Seven (33%) of 21 controls showed mechanical disc abnormalities, including disc bulge, disc desiccation, torn annulus, and an isolated Schmorl's node. A transitional lumbosacral vertebra was seen in 2 controls. None of the patients in the control group showed marginal edema of the end plates.

Cases versus controls

The key findings seen in both groups are summarized in Table 1. Apophyseal joint synovitis was more common in patients with ERA compared to the control group. This difference was highly significant at P = 0.004. Intense interspinous ligament enhancement was also statistically more common in ERA cases compared to the controls (P = 0.04). The difference between the cases and controls in the prevalence of disc changes and end-plate edema was not statistically significant.

### Effective disc age: a statistical model for age-dependent and level-specific lumbar disc degeneration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^3593e42f]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assessment of disc degeneration is an important part of efforts to understand and treat low back pain. Accordingly, many degeneration grading schemes can be found in the literature. However, the concept of “disc degeneration” combines many processes and phenotypes. Degenerative changes may be caused by mechanical injury, genetics, environmental factors, or simply normal aging. Multiple etiologies may affect a disc simultaneously. Currently, a critical problem in low back pain etiology is an inability to distinguish pathological from non-pathological disc degeneration. Although some weak associations have been reported between degeneration and low back pain, most disc degeneration is asymptomatic and of little clinical concern. This problem is in part due to an inability to distinguish age-related degeneration (“normal aging”), which is ubiquitous, from all other forms of degeneration.

To support hypothesis testing, diagnosis, and treatment, a critical need exists to isolate and quantify expected degenerative changes associated with normal aging. In an effort to remove normal aging from the definition of disc degeneration, degeneration has been redefined as cell-mediated, progressive structural failure combined with “accelerated or advanced signs of aging”. We subsequently refer to such degeneration as accelerated degeneration. However, there is currently no tool to quantify whether a disc has normal or accelerated/advanced signs of aging. As the prevalence of lumbar disc degenerative features increases with age, and the prevalence of each feature increases at different rates, it may be feasible to quantify normal aging and thus accelerated degeneration of lumbar discs in a data-driven manner.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^608fbd4e]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Spinal stenosis—definition, prevalence, types, mechanisms, and presentation—is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in symptoms and signs from neural and vascular compression, with varying degrees shown to be present in 27.2% of the elderly population. Congenital or acquired spinal stenosis may be central, foraminal, or both, and disc bulging, protrusion, and extrusion with osteophytes, facet arthritic changes, and hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava can narrow the canal and compress dural sac contents. Foraminal stenosis is largely secondary to degenerative facet disease, potentially with a significant disc component, producing compression or distortion of the exiting nerve root. In central stenosis, symptoms are secondary to direct compression of the cauda equina, altered arterial flow, venous congestion producing increased epidural pressure, and nerve root excitation by local inflammation. Clinical presentation varies from focal radiculopathy to neurogenic claudication with buttocks or leg pain when walking that disappears with sitting or lumbar flexion; foraminal stenosis presents with radicular pain, and combined central and foraminal stenoses generally present with neurogenic claudication as well as radicular pain. In addition to congenital and acquired causes, acute trauma may also produce central and/or foraminal stenoses due to retropulsion of the vertebral body middle column into the canal, with or without a significant epidural hematoma, and distortion of the neural foramina.

### A population-based study of juvenile disc degeneration and its association with overweight and obesity, low back pain, and diminished functional status [^e30aec31]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known regarding juvenile disc degeneration in individuals with normal spinal alignment. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence, determinants, and clinical relevance associated with juvenile disc degeneration of the lumbar spine in individuals without spinal deformities.

Methods

A cross-sectional assessment of disc degeneration in juveniles was performed as part of a population-based study of 1989 Southern Chinese volunteers. Adolescents and young adults from thirteen to twenty years of age were defined as "juveniles." Juvenile subjects with no spinal deformity (n = 83) were stratified into two groups, those with and those without juvenile disc degeneration. Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) were evaluated for the presence and extent of disc degeneration as well as other spinal findings. Demographics were assessed and clinical profiles were collected with use of standardized questionnaires.

Results

Juvenile disc degeneration was present in 35% (twenty-nine) of the juveniles without spinal deformity. Disc bulging or extrusion (p < 0.001), high-intensity zones on MRI (p = 0.040), and greater weight (p < 0.001) and height (p = 0.002) were significantly more prevalent in subjects with juvenile disc degeneration. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression modeling demonstrated that Asian-modified body-mass index (BMI) values in the overweight or obese range had a significant association with juvenile disc degeneration (odds ratio = 14.19; 95% confidence interval = 1.44 to 140.40; p = 0.023). Overweight and obese individuals had greater severity of disc degeneration than underweight and normal-weight individuals (p = 0.036). Furthermore, individuals with juvenile disc degeneration had an increased prevalence of low back pain and/or sciatica (p = 0.002), greater low back pain intensity (p < 0.001), diminished social functioning (p = 0.049), and greater physical disability (p < 0.05) than individuals without disc degeneration. The p value of <0.05 for physical disability represents both the physical function (p = 0.006) and the physical component (p = 0.032) of the SF-36.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that the presence of juvenile disc degeneration was strongly associated with overweight and obesity, low back pain, increased low back pain intensity, and diminished physical and social functioning. Furthermore, an elevated BMI was significantly associated with increased severity of disc degeneration. This study has public health implications regarding overweight and obesity and the development of lumbar disc disease.

### Clinical evaluation and treatment options for herniated lumbar disc (...) [^f17c4ada]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The intervertebral disc is responsible for the attachment of vertebral bodies to each other, providing flexibility and absorbing and distributing the loads applied to the spinal column. With aging, the disc undergoes significant changes in volume and shape as well as in biochemical composition and biomechanical properties. Lumbar disc herniations are believed to result from anular degeneration that leads to a weakening of the anulus fibrosus, leaving the disc susceptible to anular fissuring and tearing. Etiology of Disc Degeneration The intervertebral disc is arranged in four concentric layers: an outer anulus fibrosus composed of dense collagen fibril lamellae; a fibrocartilaginous inner anulus fibrosus; a transition zone; and the central nucleus pulposus. Several factors, including genetic factors and changes in hydration and collagen, are believed to play a role in the development of degenerative disc disease.

It is widely accepted that the water-binding capability of the nucleus plays an integral role in the physical properties of the disc. In the healthy disc, the nucleus distributes the applied forces equally throughout the anulus. Decreased hydration of the disc can reduce the cushioning effect, thus transmitting a greater portion of the applied loads to the anulus in an asymmetric distribution, . 3 which could lead to injury, as illustrated in Figure 2. Increases in the collagen content of the nucleus and in its crystallinity have been reported to be partially responsible for disc degeneration. 4 The possibility of genetic effects has been investigated in other spinal disorders, such as scoliosis, spondylolisthesis and ankylosing spondylitis, but few studies have searched for genetic factors in degenerative disc disease. One study. The most common levels for a herniated disc are L4-5 and L5-S1.

The onset of symptoms is characterized by a sharp, burning, stabbing pain radiating down the posterior or lateral aspect of the leg, to below the knee. Pain is generally superficial and localized, and is often associated with numbness or tingling. MRI also has the ability to demonstrate damage to the intervertebral disc, including anular tears and edema in the adjacent end plates. As with CT scans, MRI can reveal bulging and degenerative discs in asymptomatic persons; therefore, any management decisions should be based on the clinical findings corroborated by diagnostic test results. 11.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^f145a98e]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Automated percutaneous mechanical lumbar disc decompression (APLD)—APLD uses a pneumatically driven, suction-cutting probe in a cannula with a 2.8 mm outer diameter with removal of 1 to 3 grams of disc material to reduce the intradiscal pressure and decompress the nerve roots. The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Technology Assessment (DATTA) published in JAMA in 1989 concluded that percutaneous discectomy, particularly the automated procedure using Onik Nucleotome, is a promising treatment for herniated lumbar discs wherein the nuclear bulge is contained by the nucleus, and they concluded that further studies were needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of this procedure for this indication.

### Prevalence of annular tears and disc herniations on MR images of the cervical spine in symptom free volunteers [^128ef4c0]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective MR analysis of the cervical spine of 30 asymptomatic volunteers.

Objectives

To evaluate the prevalence of annular tears, bulging discs, disc herniations and medullary compression on T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spine in symptom free volunteers.

Summary Of Background Data

Few studies have reported the prevalence of cervical disc herniations in asymptomatic people, none have reported the prevalence of cervical annular tears on MR images of symptom free volunteers.

Materials and Methods

Thirty symptom-free volunteers (no history or symptoms related to the cervical spine) were examined using sagittal T2-weighted fast spin-echo (SE), sagittal gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted SE imaging and axial T2(*)-weighted gradient echo (GRE). The prevalence of bulging discs, focal protrusions, extrusions, nonenhancing or enhancing annular tears and medullary compression were assessed.

Results

The prevalence of bulging disk and focal disk protrusions was 73% (22 volunteers) and 50% (15 volunteers), respectively. There was one extrusion (3%). Eleven volunteers had annular tears at one or more levels (37%) and 94% of the annular tears enhanced after contrast injection. Asymptomatic medullary compression was found in four patients (13%).

Conclusion

Annular tears and focal disk protrusions are frequently found on MR imaging of the cervical spine, with or without contrast enhancement, in asymptomatic population. The extruded disk herniation and medullary compression are unusual findings in a symptom-free population.

### Imaging of the aging spine [^2182d830]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Degeneration of the spine is a normal aspect of aging. The associated changes of spine degeneration seen on imaging are typically asymptomatic. However, distinguishing normal age-related change from symptomatic pathologic change can be challenging owing to the overlap in imaging features. Understanding the general prevalence, timing, and evolution of age-related change can aid in this differentiation and help prevent imaging overdiagnosis and unnecessary workup.

### Motion characteristics and related factors of modic changes in the lumbar spine [^48cce698]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECT Most studies of Modic changes (MCs) have focused on investigating the relationship between MCs and lowback pain, whereas the kinematic characteristics and degenerative disc disease associated with MCs are not well understood. To the authors' knowledge, no previous study has reported on the kinematics of MCs. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship of MCs to segmental motion and degenerative disc disease. METHODS Four hundred fifty symptomatic patients underwent weight-bearing lumbar kinematic MRI in the neutral, flexion, and extension positions. Segmental displacement and intervertebral angles were measured in 3 positions using computer analysis software. Modic changes, disc degeneration, disc bulging, spondylolisthesis, angular motion, and translational motion were recorded, and the relationship of MCs to these factors was analyzed using a logistic regression model. To control the influence of disc degeneration on segmental motion, angular and translational motion were analyzed according to mild and severe disc degeneration stages. The motion characteristics and disc degeneration among types of MCs were also evaluated. RESULTS Multivariate analysis revealed that age, disc degeneration, angular motion, and translational motion were factors significantly related to MCs. In the severe disc degeneration stage, a significant decrease of angular motion and significant increase of translational motion were found in segments with MCs, indicating that a disorder of the endplate had an additional effect on segmental motion. Disc degeneration increased and angular motion decreased significantly and gradually as the type of MC increased. Translational motion was significantly increased with Type 2 MCs. CONCLUSIONS Age, disc degeneration, angular motion, and translational motion were significantly linked to MCs in the lumbar spine. The translational motion of lumbar segments increased with Type 2 MCs, whereas angular motion decreased as the type of MC increased, indicating that Type 2 MCs may have translational instability likely due to degenerative changes. A disorder of the endplates could play an important role in spinal instability.

### Determinants of the progression in lumbar degeneration: a 5-year follow-up study of adult male monozygotic twins [^d486157e]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

A 5-year follow-up study of exposure of discordant monozygotic twin pairs with repeated interviews and spine imaging.

Objective

The primary goals were to record changes in the degenerative signs over a 5-year interval and to estimate the effects of familial influences and suspected environmental risk factors on the speed of lumbar degeneration.

Summary Of Background Data

Traditionally, disc degeneration has been attributed to aging and environmental exposures; recently, a dominant effect of genetics has been revealed. Yet the etiopathogenesis of disc degeneration remains poorly understood and controversial despite being a primary target of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Methods

Among 116 monozygotic twin pairs, which had been examined 5 years earlier, 75 pairs (150 men) were reexamined. They were imaged using the same MRI scanner and examination protocol as at baseline. The data were analyzed using statistical methods for longitudinal studies.

Results

Progression in disc height narrowing, disc bulging, osteophytosis, and fatty degeneration in the lumbar spine was seen in about 7% to 13% of the discs in 7% to 46% of subjects during 5-year follow-up. Few degenerative findings appear to reverse; few disc height measures increased, some anular tears were no longer visible, and bulging/herniation diminished. New anular tears (in axial view) were detected in 1.5%, disappeared in 2%, and were unchanged in 5.3% of discs; in the sagittal view, new high intensity zones findings were identified in 0.5%, were no longer apparent in 1.6%, and were unchanged in 7.1% of discs. There were no clear changes in upper endplates: in 2.1% of discs, the irregularity score increased and in 1.8% it decreased. Familial aggregation, reflecting genetic, and shared environmental influences, explained 47% to 66% of the variance in progression of degenerative signs on lumbar MRI, and resistance training and occupational physical loading together explained 2% to 10% of the progression in the degenerative signs in lumbar MRIs.

Conclusions

Progression of disc height narrowing, bulging, osteophytes, and fatty degeneration was detected in about 10% or less of the T12-S1 discs. Development and disappearance of anular lesions were rarer. No clear changes were seen in endplate irregularities. The results also confirm that hereditary effects have a dominant role in the progression of disc degeneration and suggest that occupational lifting and leisure time resistance training have modest additional effects.

### Lumbar interspinous bursitis (baastrup disease) in a symptomatic population: prevalence on magnetic resonance imaging [^6e38ed30]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional retrospective review of 539 patients with lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of lumbar posterior element interspinous bursitis (Baastrup disease) and to measure the association with degenerative disc disease findings, deformities, age, and gender in symptomatic people.

Summary Of Background Data

Case reports and small case series describing Baastrup disease exist. The prevalence of Baastrup disease on MRI and association with other degenerative-related findings has not been reported.

Methods

The study group consisted of 539 patients (51% males, 49% females; age range, 7-89 years old) undergoing routine lumbar spine MRI using sagittal T1-weighted, sagittal T2-weighted, and axial T2-weighted pulse sequences. Retrospective consensus review by 2 observers evaluated for the presence of: fluid intervening between consecutive spinous processes (criterion for Baastrup disease), disc degeneration (spondylosis) and contour abnormalities (bulges, herniations), marrow endplate signal alteration (Modic changes), central canal stenosis, lordosis, scoliosis, and displacement (anterolisthesis, retrolisthesis). Statistical analyses were descriptive statistics and determining associations between these MRI findings and Baastrup disease (using chi and Wilcoxon rank sums).

Results

Lumbar interspinous bursitis (Baastrup disease) was present in 8.2% (44 of 539) of the study population. There were associations between the presence of Baastrup disease and age (P = 0.001), central canal stenosis (P = 0.0013), disc bulging (P = 0.0341), and anterolisthesis (P = 0.0429). There were not associations between Baastrup disease and disc degeneration, disc herniation, endplate findings, retrolisthesis, scoliosis, lordosis, or gender.

Conclusion

Lumbar interspinous bursitis (Baastrup disease) is uncommon but not infrequent in symptomatic patients undergoing lumbar spine MRI. Patients with MRI evident Baastrup disease tend to be older, have central canal stenosis, bulging discs, and anterolisthesis. Further investigations determining the clinical significance of this finding are necessary.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^11e69bfc]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Thoracic disc related pathology—diagnostic assessment is based on history, physical examination, neurological examination, and imaging. Age-related imaging changes in asymptomatic subjects are common, and plain radiographs are not sensitive enough to exclude disease. Computed tomography (CT) myelography is an alternative when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated; MRI may be too sensitive and yield false-positive findings, though it can reliably distinguish infection, fracture, and tumor. Electrophysiologic studies can objectify nerve conduction abnormalities resulting from radiculopathy, and some patients may require diagnostic interventions with provocation discography and controlled diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks.

### Trends in adolescent lumbar disk herniation [^ddb1e888]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2006). Low credibility.

The authors have retrospectively studied the trends in etiology, symptoms, and rate of recurrence for adolescents with disk herniations to determine the age at onset of symptoms, mechanism of injury, familial history, pattern of symptoms, level of herniation, method of treatment, and rate of recurrence. The review revealed a higher incidence of adolescent lumbar disk herniations in female patients and a higher percentage of patients with a family history than previously reported. Leg pain continues to be the primary presenting symptom in this group of patients and is often not recognized as the radicular pain of a herniated disk by the primary care physician. This reflects a lack of understanding of the relationship of the presenting symptoms to the pathology of the herniated nucleus pulposus, causing a delay in referral to the spine specialist.

### Tandem age-related lumbar and cervical intervertebral disc changes in asymptomatic subjects [^2f8e8085]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the frequency of tandem lumbar and cervical intervertebral disc degeneration in asymptomatic subjects.

Methods

We evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results from 94 volunteers (48 men and 46 women; mean age 48 years) for age-related intervertebral disc degeneration in the lumbar and cervical spine.

Results

MRI indicated degenerative changes in the lumbar spine in 79 subjects (84 %), with decreased disc signal intensity in 74.5 %, posterior disc protrusion in 78.7 %, anterior compression of the dura in 81.9 %, disc space narrowing in 21.3 %, and spinal canal stenosis in 12.8 %. These findings were more common in older subjects at caudal levels. MRI showed degenerative changes in both the lumbar and cervical spine in 78.7 % of the volunteers.

Conclusions

Degenerative findings in both the lumbar and cervical spine, suggesting tandem disc degeneration, was common in asymptomatic subjects. These results provide normative data for evaluating patients with degenerative lumbar and cervical disc diseases.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^b99afedc]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential biomarkers of LBP that are commonly detected on routine clinical scans include BM lesions at the vertebral endplates, disc bulges and herniation, and spondylolysis. The proposed comprehensive scoring system is based on visual reading of T1- and T2-weighted sequences with structured reporting. A strength is that this scoring system integrates previously established grading schemes within a standardized approach. The majority of such schemes has demonstrated at least substantial inter- and/or intra-rater reliability (e.g. classification of Modic-type endplate changes or Pfirrmann grading for degenerative disc disease). On the other hand, potential weaknesses include the qualitative/semi-quantitative nature of analyses by visual image reading and bias towards only structural findings rather than compositional findings. Related to this, the relationships between pathologies evaluated by these established grading schemes and pain might be variable, and thus, the clinical implications are unclear. For instance, it has been reported that Modic-type endplate changes have inconsistent associations with pain. Inconsistencies may stem from several sources, including imprecise description of Modic-type endplate changes for clinical reports, utilization of MRI equipment that introduces grading bias, or acquisition of imaging sequences that inadvertently misrepresent these changes. Specifically, omission of basic methodological details and, most notably, restriction to mainly qualitative/semi-quantitative, non-standardized evaluation of MRI data for Modic-type endplate changes make it difficult to draw more final conclusions about the correlation of LBP and vertebral endplate pathology.

Several novel MRI-based methods are undergoing research and development that may allow detection of biomarkers not seen on conventional lumbar MRI on the way to improved understanding of LBP mechanisms. For example, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify spectral features related to intervertebral disc structure and acidity, and results from MRS correlated well with provocative discography, thus could potentially support improved surgical outcomes among patients with chronic LBP. Furthermore, ultra-short echo-time (UTE) imaging and chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI (CSE-MRI) have been proposed to be more sensitive to endplate damage or BM pathology and allow both to be quantified, yet without the need for specialized MRI hardware or application of contrast agents. Structural damage of the endplate is believed to trigger endplate neo-innervation and painful endplate BM lesions, and cartilage endplate fibrosis blocks nutrient transport to the disc cells, thereby hindering cell survival, disc matrix homeostasis, and regenerative potential.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^f09f4e87]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is the leading cause of disability globally and associated with a large burden on persons, healthcare systems, and society. Radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most recognizable disorders of the low back. The diagnosis is typically based on a combination of symptoms and signs suggesting lumbar spinal nerve root compression or irritation, such as radicular pain with nerve root tension signs, neurologic deficits, and imaging findings that correlate with the clinical syndrome. LDH, defined as the localised displacement of disc material beyond the margins of the intervertebral disc space, is the most common cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Compared with nonspecific low back pain without radiculopathy, LDH with radiculopathy is typically associated with greater pain, disability, healthcare use, and intervention.

Previous studies of symptomatic LDH have reported a point prevalence of about 5% in adults 30 years of age and older, varying by sex and age. In people aged 25 to 55 years, 95% of symptomatic herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels). However, little is known about the incidence of LDH with radiculopathy, and consequently, risk factors are not well understood. Our aim was to synthesise the evidence on the incidence of and risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults. To the best of our knowledge, no recent systematic review has focused on synthesising the best available evidence on the incidence and risk factors of LDH with radiculopathy.

Therefore, the specific research questions for this systematic review were:
What is the incidence of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with radiculopathy in adults?
What are the risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults?

### The value of magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine to predict low-back pain in asymptomatic subjects: a seven-year follow-up study [^41bf79d2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2001). Low credibility.

Background

In 1989, a group of sixty-seven asymptomatic individuals with no history of back pain underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. Twenty-one subjects (31%) had an identifiable abnormality of a disc or of the spinal canal. In the current study, we investigated whether the findings on the scans of the lumbar spine that had been made in 1989 predicted the development of low-back pain in these asymptomatic subjects.

Methods

A questionnaire concerning the development and duration of low-back pain over a seven-year period was sent to the sixty-seven asymptomatic individuals from the 1989 study. A total of fifty subjects completed and returned the questionnaire. A repeat magnetic resonance scan was made for thirty-one of these subjects. Two neuroradiologists and one orthopaedic spine surgeon interpreted the original and repeat scans in a blinded fashion, independent of clinical information. At each disc level, any radiographic abnormality, including bulging or degeneration of the disc, was identified. Radiographic progression was defined as increasing severity of an abnormality at a specific disc level or the involvement of additional levels.

Results

Of the fifty subjects who returned the questionnaire, twenty-nine (58%) had no back pain. Low-back pain developed in twenty-one subjects during the seven-year study period. The 1989 scans of these subjects demonstrated normal findings in twelve, a herniated disc in five, stenosis in three, and moderate disc degeneration in one. Eight individuals had radiating leg pain; four of them had had normal findings on the original scans, two had had spinal stenosis, one had had a disc protrusion, and one had had a disc extrusion. In general, repeat magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a greater frequency of disc herniation, bulging, degeneration, and spinal stenosis than did the original scans.

Conclusions

The findings on magnetic resonance scans were not predictive of the development or duration of low-back pain. Individuals with the longest duration of low-back pain did not have the greatest degree of anatomical abnormality on the original, 1989 scans. Clinical correlation is essential to determine the importance of abnormalities on magnetic resonance images.

Cervical radicular pain and spondylosis—mechanisms and prevalence: Cervical radicular pain is due to cervical nerve root compression and cervical radiculopathy is the result of conduction block associated with damage to either the axon or myelin, with major causes including disc protrusion and cervical spondylosis. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine reach a prevalence of nearly 95% by age 65, and are associated with disc protrusion, neuroforaminal narrowing, and spinal cord contour changes in up to 78% of asymptomatic individuals.

### MRI findings are more common in selected patients with acute low back pain than controls? [^70490a89]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to investigate if lumbar disc pathology identified on MRI scans is more common in patients with acute, likely discogenic, low back pain than matched controls.

Methods

We compared rates of MRI findings between 30 cases with low back pain and 30 pain-free controls. Cases were patients presenting for care with likely discogenic low back pain (demonstrated centralisation with repeated movement testing), of moderate intensity and with minimal past history of back pain. Controls were matched for age, gender and past history of back pain. Cases and controls underwent MRI scanning which was read for the presence of a range of MRI findings by two blinded assessors.

Results

The presence of disc degeneration, modic changes and disc herniation significantly altered the odds of a participant being a case or control. For example subjects were 5.2 times more likely to be a case than a control when disc degeneration grade of ≥3 was present, and 6.0 times more likely with modic changes. The presence of a high-intensity zone or annular tear was found to significantly alter odds for one assessor but not the other assessor.

Conclusion

MRI findings including disc degeneration, modic changes and herniation are more common in selected people with current acute (likely discogenic) low back pain than in controls without current low back pain. Further investigation of the value of MRI findings as prognostic factors and as treatment effect modifiers is required to assess the potential clinical importance of these findings.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^f2c4e524]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain imaging—radiographic degenerative changes and associations in young men are described as follows: Mild LBP was reported by 44 subjects (52%), and lumbar degenerative changes were found in 52% of the subjects, with DSN and VOs found in 30% and 46% of subjects, respectively. There was a significant association between VOs and LBP (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.23–7.33; p=0.013), whereas there was not a significant association between DSN and LBP, and no association between LBP and lifestyle factors such as smoking, sports, alcohol intake or weight gain was demonstrated. The authors concluded that, in young men without initial radiological abnormalities, there was a significant association between VOs and incidence of mild LBP. In critique of the methodology, the work group downgraded the level of evidence of this potential Level III study due to the small sample size, and this study provides Level IV evidence that there is an association between vertebral osteophyte formation and incidence of LBP. The work group recommends the development of studies that incorporate a reference standard in patients without other confounding factors such as spondylolisthesis or radiculopathy.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis and minimally invasive lumbar decompression: a narrative review [^28ad8ea4]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common pain disorder. The prevalence of symptomatic LSS in adults was reported to be approximately 11% and increased with age.As a common pain disorder, the symptom of LSS is frustrating. The patients usually experience persistent lumbar back pain, lower extremity pain, and possibly lower leg numbness, tingling, and paresthesia. Apart from pain perception or discomfort, the patient’s ability to walk is impaired. Typically, the patients cannot walk continuously and require intermittent resting while walking, which is termed neurogenic claudication.

As a common and frustrating disease, the treatment of LSS is complicated and, in some cases, challenging. In most cases, conservative treatments, such as oral medication, physical therapy, and epidural steroid injection, should be chosen first.However, conservative treatments have been reported to have limitations.For example, physical therapy and oral medications do not have a long-lasting effect on LSS.Epidural steroid injection (ESI) has been reported to be ineffective for LSS patients with neurogenic claudication.For those refractory to conservative treatments, surgeries are required. Although invasive surgery is effective, however, its invasiveness and relatively high rate of complications are disadvantages.For those patients who have failed conservative treatment but have contraindications for invasive surgery, or who are unwilling, or not severe enough to advance to more invasive surgical procedures, both physicians and patients are often left with a treatment dilemma. Under these circumstances, minimally invasive procedures are a preferable choice.

Minimally invasive lumbar decompression (MILD, Vertos Medical, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) is an emerging minimal invasive procedure for LSS. It is reported to be a treatment modality with considerable minimal invasiveness, safety, and a high effective rate 10−13. However, the exact short- and long-term efficacy, safety profile, indication criteria, and certain procedure details reported in medical literature vary. Furthermore, there is a concern about the MILD procedure. For MILD, as the ligamentum flavum (LF) was not removed wholly, whether the nerve tissue can be decompressed adequately? Is long-term efficacy guaranteed? Therefore, in this review, we elucidate the exact effectiveness, safety profile, and treatment rationale of the MILD procedure as well as the pathogenesis and diagnosis of LSS.

### Low back pain caused by iliopsoas tendinopathy treated with ultrasound-guided local injection of anesthetic and steroid: a retrospective study [^e796ea3d]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although low back pain caused by lumbar structure disorder remain popular in some settings, the usefulness of these diagnosis in guiding treatment remains unclear.Among asymptomatic individuals, imaging findings of spine degeneration (disc bulge, disc protrusion) is prevalent.What is more, the rate of spontaneous regression was found to be 96% for disc sequestration, 70% for disc extrusion, 41% for disc protrusion, and 13% for disc bulging.Thus, identifying the pathoanatomical basis of low back pain is in urgent need to open up new approaches for people with disabling low back pain worldwide.

Disorders of hip and lumbar have overlapping presentations and symptoms. Prather et alfound that positive hip physical examination is prevalent in patients with low back pain, patients with low back pain, and positive hip examination findings have more pain and worse function compared with patients without hip examination findings. It is estimated that about 60.4% patients with hip osteoarthritis also complain of low back pain, and after total hip arthroplasty, significant improvement of low back pain can be observed 1-year postoperative.According to a systematic review of Redmond et al,patients with low back pain frequently accompany limited hip range of motion, and these patients routinely improve after surgical intervention for hip diseases. Hip diseases may closely relate with low back pain, but by what means are they related is still unknown. The iliopsoas musculotendinous unit is a powerful hip flexor which has important function in femoral external rotation and with lateral bending, flexion, and stabilizing the spine in the frontal plane.It originates from the outer surfaces of the vertebral bodies of T12-L5 and inserts on the lesser trochanter of the femur (Figure 2). We hypothesize that the pathology of the iliopsoas musculotendinous unit may contribute to low back pain caused by hip disorders.

### Lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration as a common incidental finding in young pregnant women as observed on prenatal magnetic resonance imaging [^5efadfb8]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Obstetric imaging, subserving fetal evaluation, may yield incidental maternal findings. Based on prenatal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, this study aims to investigate incidental intervertebral disc degeneration and displacement in young, pregnant women. Methods: This retrospective study included the sagittal 1.5 Tesla, T2-weighted lumbar spine images of 943 pregnant Central Europeans (age range, 18-47 years), who initially had undergone MR imaging because of sonographically suspected fetal abnormalities. Qualitatively, 4715 lumbar intervertebral discs were evaluated for degeneration using a modified Pfirrmann MR classification (nondegenerated, low-grade, moderate, and high-grade degeneration), as well as for displacement. In addition to descriptive statistics, an ordinal regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between degeneration and the women's age, and body weight. Results: With regard to the highest degree of degeneration in each woman, 578 (61.3%) showed low-grade, 211 (22.4%) moderate, and 154 (16.3%) high-grade degeneration, and no woman had entirely nondegenerated discs. For the span from 18 to 47 years of age, moderate and high-grade degeneration increased from 6.7% to 36.7% and from 13.3% to 22.4%, respectively. Of 943 women, 57 (6%) had disc displacements, of which 97% were in conjunction with high-grade degeneration. There was a statistically significant relationship ( p <0.001) between degeneration and age, and between degeneration and body weight. Conclusions: In young pregnant women, lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration is a ubiquitous, incidental finding, increasing from the late second decade of life onward, which may be part of physiological aging, as opposed to a small percentage of incidental disc displacements.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review the appearance of various abnormalities that affect the lumbar intervertebral disk and diskovertebral segment through anatomic-pathologic correlation in cadavers. CONCLUSION. Familiarity with the pathologic conditions in and around the intervertebral disk is important in recognizing such conditions as a potential source of symptoms. We revisit the principal role of MRI in evaluating these abnormalities and excluding other sources of significant clinical manifestations.

### The relative roles of intragenic polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene in lumbar spine degeneration and bone density [^966cde09]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Objectives

To compare the magnitudes of the associations of TaqI polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene with bone density and lumbar spine degeneration in the same sample.

Summary Of Background Data

Vitamin D receptor gene variations are associated with osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration. Their role in these conditions remains poorly understood.

Methods

Bone density of the spine and femur were determined through DEXA, and lumbar disc degeneration was determined from magnetic resonance imaging assessments of signal intensity, disc narrowing, bulging, anular tears, herniations, and osteophytes. Associations between these measures and TaqI polymorphisms of the coding region of the Vitamin D receptor locus were examined in a population-based sample of 142 men.

Results

The strongest associations were with signal intensity and anular tears, which were worse for the subjects with tt genotypes than for those with TT genotypes in the L4-S1 spine discs. Conversely, the prevalences of disc bulges and osteophytes were lowest for the tt genotype. Bone density, disc height, and herniations did not differ significantly by genotype.

Conclusions

The strongest association of Vitamin D receptor TaqI polymorphisms with degeneration in nonmineralized connective tissues suggests that the underlying mechanism of TaqI polymorphisms is not specific to bone. This study demonstrated for the first time that those with the tt genotype had more anular tears than those with the TT genotype, a finding that should stimulate further analyses of this gene in conditions that result in back pain. The apparent discrepancies of the associations of the tt genotype with lower signal intensity and more anular tears, but less bulges and osteophytes, could be explained if bulging and osteophytes primarily represented remodeling related to lifetime physical loading.

### Back pain and degenerative abnormalities in the spine of young elite divers: a 5-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging study [^c0e591b2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Several studies have been published on disc degeneration among young athletes in sports with great demands on the back, but few on competitive divers; however, there are no long-term follow-up studies. Twenty elite divers between 10 and 21 years of age, with the highest possible national ranking, were selected at random without knowledge of previous or present back injuries or symptoms for an MRI study of the thoraco-lumbar spine in a 5-year longitudinal study. The occurrence of MRI abnormalities and their correlation with back pain were evaluated. Eighty-nine percent of the divers had a history of back pain and the median age at the first episode of back pain was 15 years. Sixty-five percent of the divers had MRI abnormalities in the thoraco-lumbar spine already at baseline. Only one diver without abnormalities at baseline had developed abnormalities at follow-up. Deterioration of any type of abnormality was found in 9 of 17 (53%) divers. Including all disc levels in all divers, the total number of abnormalities increased by 29% at follow-up, as compared to baseline. The most common abnormalities were reduced disc signal, Schmorl's nodes, and disc height reduction. Since almost all divers had previous or present back pain, a differentiated analysis of the relationship between pain and MRI findings was not possible. However, the high frequency of both back pain and MRI changes suggests a causal relationship. In conclusion, elite divers had high frequency of back pain at young ages and they run a high risk of developing degenerative abnormalities of the thoraco-lumbar spine, probably due to injuries to the spine during the growth spurt.

Lumbar radiculopathy outcomes and discogenic pain prevalence indicate that radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have pronounced symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discs showed internal disc disruption in 39% of a young cohort following injury and 42% in a heterogenous population of all ages and types of low back pain, and in a separate study assessing discogenic pain without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate was 26%.

Low back pain imaging—lumbar degenerative disc disease (DD) in Finnish concrete workers showed weak associations with symptom history. In 295 Finnish concrete workers aged 19–64 years, DD severity was graded as none, slight (12%), moderate (23%) or severe (9%). After adjusting for age there was a weak association between history of LBP and DD (p<0.01) and a weak association between history of sciatica and DD (p<0.001). The authors concluded the association between lumbar DD and LBP or sciatica was independent of age, and this study provides Level IV evidence that lumbar degeneration has a weak correlation with LBP.

Common Injuries as We Age Still Going Strong focuses on preventing injuries among older adults, because it is a large and growing public health problem facing our nation. Over 10, 000 people in the United States turn 65 every day. 1 The number of injuries could increase as the population of older adults grows. Healthcare costs associated with these injuries may also increase. Unintentional injuries have traditionally been the 7 th leading cause of death among adults ages 65 and over. During the COVID-19 pandemic, unintentional injuries moved to the 8 th leading cause of death among older adults. Falls and motor vehicle crashes are the leading mechanisms of unintentional injury deaths and result in the majority of TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths among older adults. 2, 3. A traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is an injury that affects how the brain works.

It may be caused by a:

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy—about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Prevalence of spinal pathology in patients presenting for lumbar MRI as referred from general practice [^e227af5f]. Family Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as initial imaging for back pain has increased in general practice. However, few data are available on the characteristics of these referred patients. The objective of this study was to describe the baseline characteristics and MRI findings of patients presenting for a lumbar MRI examination as referred by their GP.

Methods

Patients presenting for a lumbar MRI examination as referred by their GP were recruited at the MRI Center. The MRI radiology reports were scored for the presence of disc bulging, disc herniation, nerve root compression, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis and serious pathologies. Information on patients' characteristics, characteristics of the complaints and red flags were derived from questionnaires. Cross-sectional differences between patients with and without specific MRI findings were analyzed.

Results

A total of 683 low back pain (LBP) patients were included; mean age was 49.9 (range 19-80) years and 53% was male. Mean back pain severity score was 6.6 (SD 2.0) and 67% of the patients reported having chronic LBP. In total, 374 patients (55%) reported sciatica complaints for at least 6 weeks. Of all MRI reports, 69% mentioned signs of nerve root compression. Serious pathologies were reported in 3% of the patients. In total, 94% of patients had abnormal MRI findings.

Conclusions

Almost all patients presenting for a lumbar MRI examination as referred by their GP had abnormal MRI findings. In total, 55% of the patients reported persistent sciatica in which imaging is recommended according to international guidelines.

Lateral Recess

The lateral recess (aka the subarticular zone) is the outermost region of the spinal canal that is bordered laterally by the pedicle, posteriorly by the superior articular facet and LF, and anteriorly by the vertebral body, endplate and disc margin. This region is considered stenotic when AP measurement is <4 mm.Nerve root compression in the lateral recess is also another important qualitative parameter in the radiological assessment for lateral recess stenosis.Due to the close proximity within the canal, stenosis in this region can lead to symptoms of radiculopathy due to nerve root compression with or without NC and can have a bilateral or unilateral presentation.

Foraminal

The neuroforamen is formed by the interpedicular osseous opening in which each spinal nerve root exits the dural sac passing through the lateral recess. The anterior anatomic boundaries of the intervertebral foramen include the adjacent superior-inferior vertebral pedicles, posteroinferior margin of the superior vertebral body, the intervertebral disc, and the posterosuperior margin of the inferior vertebral body, and the posterior anatomic boundaries include the LF and the superior and inferior articular facets.This region has three anatomical zones: internal, intraforaminal and extraforaminal. Degenerative changes such as hypertrophy and bone spurs from facet joints and bulging or herniated discs often contribute to foraminal stenosis.The neuroforamen are considered stenotic based on reduced perineural fat and/or reduced foraminal dimensions on MRI. A height less than 15 mm and a posterior disc height of 4 mm or less are associated with significant nerve root compression.Lumbar foraminal stenosis has a reported prevalence of 8% to 11%.Symptoms of pure foraminal stenosis typically are due to neural compression or neural irritation from an inflammatory cascade with a dermatomal distribution. Although no clinical finding is specific enough to suggest foraminal stenosis, patients often present with radicular leg pain and limited lumbar range of motion, particularly with extension. Low back pain, particularly in the buttock region, is often associated with foraminal stenosis.

Multistructural

Multistructural narrowing involving the central, lateral recess, and neuroforamen is the most frequently encountered LSS in those >60 years old. The narrowing typically has a trefoil or cloverleaf appearance on axial cross-sections, in which all three regions of the spinal canal are narrowed. Symptoms are a combination of the above with nonspecific physical examination findings.

### Degenerative disorders of the spine [^2d99e700]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with back pain and degenerative disorders of the spine have a significant impact on health care costs. Some authors estimate that up to 80% of all adults experience back pain at some point in their lives. Disk herniation represents one of the most frequent causes. Nevertheless, other degenerative diseases have to be considered. In this paper, pathology and imaging of degenerative spine diseases will be discussed, starting from pathophysiology of normal age-related changes of the intervertebral disk and vertebral body.

The spine is one of the most commonly imaged body parts for all age groups, with indications ranging from congenital abnormalities at birth to degenerative pathology toward the end of life. Because of the importance of softtissue contrast when imaging the spine, MR imaging has become the most important modality in its evaluation. One of the key challenges in the clinical analysis of spinal MR imaging lies in the wide range of so-called normal variability. The goal of this article is not to provide the reader with an exhaustive atlas detailing the appearance of every known variant. Instead, the authors review the MR appearance of the most important variants and provide a logical and, they hope, memorable framework for assimilating this information into practice. To understand why these variations occur, the authors examine the aberrant pathways of embryology, growth, and development that lead to their formation.

Assessment of the Type of Disc Degeneration

Degree of disk herniation according to the lumbar disk pathologic classification of the North American Spine Society.Bulging disc: The presence of disc tissue extending beyond the edges of the ring apophyses. Protrusion: The greatest distance between the edges of the disc material presenting outside the disc space is less than the distance between the edges of the base of that disc material extending outside of the disc space. Extrusion: The distance between the edges of the disc material outside the disc space is greater than the distance between the base edges, or when there is no continuity between the disc material within and beyond the disc space. Sequestration: The displaced disc material has lost completely any continuity with the parent disc. Schmorl’s node: Herniated discs in the vertical direction (Figure 2).

Study Design

Cross-sectional cohort study of a general population.

Objective

To investigate "abnormal" lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and their prevalence and associations with low back pain (LBP).

Summary Of Background Data

The clinical relevance of various "abnormal" findings in the lumbar spine is unclear. Distinguishing between inevitable age-related findings and degenerative findings with deleterious consequences is a challenge.

Methods

Lumbar spine MRI was obtained in 412, 40-year-old individuals. Predefined "abnormal" MRI findings were interpreted without any knowledge of patient symptoms. Associations between MRI abnormalities and LBP were calculated using odds ratios. The "overall picture" of each MRI finding was established on the basis of the frequencies, diagnostic values, and the strength and consistency of associations.

Results

Most "abnormal" MRI findings were found at the lowest lumbar levels. Irregular nucleus shape and reduced disc height were common (>50% of individuals). Relatively common (25% to 50%) were hypointense disc signal, anular tears, high intensity zones, disc protrusions, endplate changes, zygapophyseal joint degeneration, asymmetry, and foraminal stenosis. Nerve root compromise, Modic changes, central spinal stenosis, and anterolisthesis/retrolisthesis were rare (<25%). Most strongly associated with LBP were Modic changes and anterolisthesis (odds ratios >4). Significantly positive associations with all LBP variables were seen for hypointense disc signals, reduced disc height, and Modic changes. All disc "abnormalities" except protrusion were moderately associated with LBP during the past year.

Conclusion

Most degenerative disc "abnormalities" were moderately associated with LBP. The strongest associations were noted for Modic changes and anterolisthesis. Further studies are needed to define clinical relevance.

### Effective disc age: a statistical model for age-dependent and level-specific lumbar disc degeneration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^4a0135dc]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study used a population of 84 healthy, asymptomatic subjects of uniformly distributed age and sex to establish a 4-predictor statistical model for normal aging of the intervertebral disc. This model addresses a key challenge in the field—quantifying normal aging to enable distinction between normal aging and accelerated degeneration. Using the 4 predictors of NP T2 time, subject height, disc mid-sagittal area, and disc volume, the model calculates the age at which a disc would, on average, exhibit the observed phenotype; i.e. the “effective disc age”. The difference between the effective disc age and the subject’s actual age provides a simple, objective assessment of degeneration in excess of that expected from normal aging; i.e. “accelerated degeneration” (Fig. 6). The input measurements are easily obtained from MRI. In contrast to qualitative scoring systems, the effective disc age model does not suffer from inter-observer variability or adjacent disc bias, and confidence intervals for the model output can be directly calculated from known measurement uncertainty in the model inputs.

An important advantage in using this model is its ability to control for level-dependency in the presentation of age-associated disc degeneration. This is critically important because recent work has shown controlling for level and age strengthens even the association between nonspecific disc generation (Pfirrmann grade) and low back pain. Furthermore, heritability analysis shows that the majority of genetic and environmental influences on disc degeneration phenotypes are specific to the upper (L1–L4) or lower (L4–S1) lumbar spine. A common quantitative measure of disc degeneration, NP T2 time, has a relationship to Pfirrmann grade that varies by spine level. We similarly found differences between disc levels in the relationships between the considered predictor variables and aging (Table 4 ; Figs. 5, S2 and S4 A). Level-dependency is not accounted for in existing degeneration grading schemes, and would be difficult to consider in any qualitative scale, but is easily accounted for by level-specific coefficients in the effective age model (Table 3).

Low back pain intensity (VAS) before the surgery was identical in both age groups (7.7 ± 1.2 and 7.8 ± 1.3). The pain levels went down to 1.6 ± 1.4 and 1.8 ± 1.2 at 6 weeks after surgery and at the last follow-up time point among the younger age group vs 2.0 ± 1.5 and 2.2 ± 1.3 in the older age group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the pain levels between the groups, at both time points post-surgery (P >.05).

The same trend was noted in the ODI data. The scores in both age groups before the surgery were almost identical, 49 ± 15 in the younger age group and 48 ± 18 in the older age group. The decrease in the ODI scores after the surgery was statistically significant compared to the scores before the surgery (P <.01) in both groups, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P >.05) (15 ± 22 and 15 ± 16 6 weeks after surgery and at the last follow-up time point among the younger age group vs 15 ± 20 and 15 ± 17 in the older age group).

The data from the SF-12 questionnaire also showed that there was no difference between the two age groups before the surgery, 34 ± 11 in the younger age group and 33 ± 14 in the older age group. Although the increase in the quality of life, as was observed in the SF-12 questionnaire data, was statistically significant in both groups of age (P <.01), there was no difference between the groups (P >.05).

### Ablation of porcine ligamentum flavum with Ho: YAG, q-switched Ho: YAG, and quadrupled Nd: YAG lasers [^85223efe]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a debilitating condition whose compressive pathology can lead patients to develop severe extremity pain, numbness, and even paralysis. A significant component of this condition results from compression of nerve roots and spinal cord through progressive overgrowth of the ligamentum flavum (LF), the connective tissue bridging adjacent vertebral levels within the spinal canal 18. MRI studies have suggested that as much as 85% of spinal canal narrowing is caused by hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum 5. This progressive degenerative condition affects a significant proportion of the aging population, with an estimated prevalence of symptomatic LSS at 8.4% affecting around 1.2 million people in the U.S. alone 19. In 2006, approximately 162,008 open surgical decompressive laminectomies were performed by neurosurgeons in the U.S. in order to treat this condition 5. This procedure requires extensive soft tissue dissection, spinal bone removal and mechanical removal of the offending tissue resulting in extended patient recovery times, rehabilitation needs, and patient discomfort. However, e x vivo spine mechanical studies suggesting that removal of as little as 16% of this thickened tissue could relieve LSS symptoms 4. To this end, minimally invasive methods to selectively remove compressive LF stand to successfully strike at the offending pathology, thereby improving the quality of life for patients afflicted with this common condition.

Laser therapy has been used successfully to treat bulging or herniated intervertebral disc disease resulting in symptomatic spinal canal compression 20, 21 and the interaction of laser energy with intervertebral discs evaluated for common surgical lasers 22, 23. However, utilization of lasers to specifically ablate hypertrophied ligamentum flavum as seen in degenerative LSS has not yet been explored. Here, we present a characterization of laser/LF interactions using three types of lasers: the Ho:YAG (λ = 2080 nm, t P = 140 µs FWHM), the Q‐Switched Ho:YAG (λ = 2080 nm, t P = 260 ns FWHM), and the Q‐Switched frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG (λ = 266 nm, t P = 5 ns FWHM). The bulk absorption was measured as a function of wavelength in order to select candidate lasers and five experiments were conducted using the selected lasers.

### Minimally invasive lumbar decompression (MILD) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review of randomized and prospective trials [^826493c1]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a major cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure in the United States. Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common degenerative spine disease that results in chronic LBP and functional impairment.LSS occurs in 2–11% of the general population in the US and is most common among people 50–60 years of age.Over 200,000 Americans are impacted by LSS, making it the leading cause of spinal surgery in those over 65.

Anatomically, LSS is characterized by narrowing of the central canal, intervertebral foramen, or lateral recess and may be caused by disc protrusion, foraminal stenosis, facet hypertrophy, facet joint cartilage degeneration, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, spondylolisthesis, or osteophyte formation.Hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (HLF) contributes to 85% of cases.However, the narrowing of any of these structures may compress neural elements and lead to limited mobility and pain, as well as symptomatic neurogenic claudication.

Neurogenic claudication manifests as gluteal and leg pain, numbness, weakness, or fatigue that worsens with extension, walking or standing and improves when sitting or bending forward.Patients with LSS are typically first treated with conservative measures including physical therapy and home exercise programs, as well as medications such as oral analgesics.Conservative treatments, however, can have limited long-term efficacy in a subset of patients with LSS.Patients with LSS may also choose to undergo interventional pain interventions including epidural steroid injections (ESIs), which have been shown to provide significant short-term relief.However, studies have questioned the efficacy of ESIs in LSS patients with concomitant neurogenic claudication.Thus, if patients do not experience improvement in pain, they may elect to undergo more invasive procedures, such as decompressive surgery with or without of interspinous spacer, with or without fusion. However, these procedures are associated with higher complication rates.

Minimally invasive lumbar decompression (MILD) has been developed as an alternative to decompression surgery to increase the dimensions of the vertebral canal and achieve nerve decompression.Recent advances in minimally invasive techniques for this procedure have gained traction primarily related to their supposed reduction in post-operative complications and hospital length of stay.However, a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the literature are necessary to further elucidate the overall efficacy and proper indications for MILD.
