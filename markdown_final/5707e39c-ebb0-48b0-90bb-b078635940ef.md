## Question

What are the treatment options for amebic liver abscess?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for amebic liver abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnosis and distinguishing amebic from pyogenic abscess. Then, I should verify the first-line medical therapy, dosing, and duration. Next, I will examine when and how to use percutaneous drainage versus aspiration, including comparative outcomes. After that, I need to check indications for surgical intervention and special populations such as pregnancy and pediatrics. I will then review adjunctive therapies, monitoring, and follow-up imaging. Finally, I should consider emerging therapies and resistance, and close with a concise algorithm that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and how it shapes treatment choices. Amebic liver abscess is typically a solitary, right-lobe lesion in a patient with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and a travel or exposure history; imaging shows a hypoattenuating lesion with peripheral rim enhancement and perilesional edema, and serology supports the diagnosis, though early serology can be falsely negative, so I should double-check timing and consider PCR on aspirate when available to improve specificity and detect mixed infections [^113YhoCv] [^1113s3Mj] [^115cNveo]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — pyogenic abscesses are more often multiple, associated with biliary disease, and may require broader bacterial coverage and earlier drainage, so distinguishing these entities is crucial before committing to a purely amebic regimen [^1147LTHe].

> I will now examine first-line medical therapy. Metronidazole remains the cornerstone for amebic liver abscess. The FDA-labeled adult regimen is 750 mg orally three times daily for 5–10 days, with pediatric dosing at 35–50 mg/kg/day divided in three doses for 10 days, and intravenous therapy at 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours when oral intake is not feasible, which I should verify against multiple label sources to ensure consistency [^113q2udw] [^111MG5xF] [^1142RLB4]. Wait, let me verify the duration — most sources endorse 7–10 days, and clinical response is typically brisk within 48–72 hours, so I should plan for at least a week unless there are complicating factors or slow response [^113q2udw].

> Next, I should review tinidazole as an alternative. Tinidazole is FDA-approved for amebic liver abscess and offers a shorter course, commonly 2 g daily for 3–5 days, with randomized data suggesting comparable or possibly superior efficacy and fewer adverse events than metronidazole; however, I need to ensure the patient is older than 3 years and that we still follow with a luminal agent to prevent relapse and transmission [^1177zH3Z] [^116g5VBY] [^115qC39p]. Hold on, I should verify that tinidazole is not used for asymptomatic cyst carriage — correct, it is indicated for invasive disease only, not for luminal eradication alone [^1177zH3Z].

> I need to ensure luminal eradication is addressed because metronidazole and tinidazole do not eradicate intestinal cysts. Paromomycin 25–35 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for 7 days is the standard luminal agent and should follow the tissue-active nitroimidazole to complete therapy and interrupt transmission; I should confirm that paromomycin is not effective for extraintestinal disease, which is why it is used second, not first [^1167cQew] [^111QqZUo]. But wait, what if the patient has severe colitis with mucosal breakdown? In that scenario, systemic absorption of paromomycin could increase, so I should coordinate with GI and pharmacy colleagues and consider timing or alternatives if mucosal integrity is severely compromised [^113QUkT4].

> Now, I should review when to drain. Most uncomplicated amebic liver abscesses resolve with medical therapy alone, but about 10–15% benefit from image-guided intervention for large size, left lobe location, imminent rupture, failure to respond after 48–72 hours, or diagnostic uncertainty; I should double-check that these indications align with contemporary reviews and guidelines before proceeding [^1147LTHe] [^116pE379]. Let me consider aspiration versus catheter drainage: needle aspiration is less invasive but may require repeats, whereas catheter drainage provides continuous decompression and may hasten clinical improvement; randomized and observational data suggest catheter drainage achieves higher technical success than repeated aspirations, though both are generally safe when performed expertly [^111Xfahv] [^112e5FYt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought aspiration might be uniformly superior, but the randomized data and larger series indicate catheter drainage has higher success and earlier cavity shrinkage, so I should tailor the method to abscess size, location, and patient tolerance for catheter care [^112e5FYt] [^111Xfahv].

> I should confirm the role of surgery. Surgical intervention is reserved for rupture with peritonitis, uncontrolled hemorrhage, failed percutaneous therapy, or complex biliary fistulas; modern interventional radiology has largely supplanted open surgery, but operative management remains lifesaving in select emergencies, and I need to escalate promptly when imaging suggests impending rupture or hemodynamic instability [^1147LTHe] [^116pE379]. Hold on, I should verify that historical series support the high mortality of open drainage in amebic disease — yes, classic surgical literature underscores the dangers of open drainage due to secondary bacterial contamination, reinforcing the preference for closed, image-guided approaches whenever feasible [^11426NoW].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, metronidazole is generally considered safe and is preferred. Paromomycin can be used for luminal therapy if the colon is intact, but I should avoid it in the setting of severe colitis with mucosal breakdown due to absorption concerns, coordinating multidisciplinary care and choosing imaging without ionizing radiation when possible [^113QUkT4] [^1113LrPD]. In children, amebic abscess is common in endemic regions, and percutaneous catheter drainage is safe and effective. I should monitor for complications such as rupture and coagulopathy and adjust therapy to weight-based dosing with careful follow-up imaging [^114QDcnT] [^113RKcyF]. For immunocompromised hosts, including HIV, I should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider atypical presentations and mixed infections, ensuring appropriate diagnostics and treatment intensity [^115Fat8s] [^111QqZUo].

> Next, I should review adjunctive and supportive measures. Empiric antibacterial coverage is reasonable when pyogenic infection cannot be excluded, particularly in endemic settings for Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess; I should tailor antibiotics to local epidemiology and de-escalate once cultures and clinical evolution clarify the diagnosis [^1113s3Mj] [^113BCAcu]. I need to check for complications such as pleural effusion, empyema, or bronchopleural fistula, which may require thoracic drainage or surgical repair, and I should involve hepatology, ID, IR, and surgery early for complex cases [^11433hpG] [^113aFXQX]. For large or complicated abscesses, I should also consider nutritional support and close monitoring for rupture or hemorrhage, integrating interventional radiology for embolization when bleeding is present [^116Dspow].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up. Clinical improvement — defervescence and pain reduction — typically occurs within 48–72 hours of initiating metronidazole. If fever persists beyond this window, I should reassess for secondary bacterial infection, obstruction, or the need for drainage and repeat imaging to document cavity resolution, which often lags clinical response by weeks to months [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify imaging cadence — ultrasound is convenient for serial follow-up, but CT or MRI may better define complications; I should individualize based on size, location, and clinical trajectory, recognizing that residual cavities can persist for months without active infection if the patient is asymptomatic and serology is improving [^112eXdRa].

> But wait, what about emerging therapies and resistance? Metronidazole resistance remains uncommon but is a growing concern; auranofin has shown potent in vitro and in vivo activity against Entamoeba histolytica and is an investigational option, though not yet standard of care, so I should reserve it for research contexts or refractory cases [^115nv5s4]. I should double-check that current guidelines still endorse metronidazole or tinidazole as first-line pending larger trials of newer agents — yes, no guideline currently replaces nitroimidazoles with auranofin outside studies [^1147LTHe].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm the diagnosis with imaging and serology, and consider PCR on aspirate if available; start metronidazole promptly while excluding pyogenic infection and assessing rupture risk. If the patient improves clinically and the abscess is small and stable, continue medical therapy and follow with a luminal agent. If there is no improvement in 48–72 hours, the abscess is large, left-sided, or at risk of rupture, proceed to image-guided drainage, favoring catheter drainage for larger or complex collections. Reserve surgery for rupture, hemorrhage, or failed percutaneous therapy. Throughout, monitor for complications, provide supportive care, and arrange follow-up imaging to confirm resolution, adjusting the plan based on response and evolving data [^1147LTHe] [^1113s3Mj] [^114qQUpM].

---

The cornerstone of amebic liver abscess treatment is **metronidazole or tinidazole** for 7–10 days [^116pE379], with tinidazole offering a shorter, equally effective course [^116g5VBY]. Most patients improve clinically within 3–5 days; **percutaneous drainage** is reserved for large abscesses (> 5 cm), imminent rupture, or failure of medical therapy [^112iftB3]. After nitroimidazole therapy, a **luminal agent** (paromomycin or diloxanide furoate) is required to eradicate intestinal cysts and prevent recurrence [^113RKcyF]. Surgery is rarely needed and is reserved for rupture, uncontrolled hemorrhage, or failed drainage [^116pE379]. Prognosis is excellent with timely therapy, though complications can occur if treatment is delayed [^115v2hUA].

## Medical therapy

### First-line antiparasitic therapy

- **Metronidazole**: 750 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days [^113q2udw]; IV 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours if oral not feasible [^1142RLB4].
- **Tinidazole**: 2 g orally once daily for 3–5 days [^116g5VBY]; shorter, equally effective, and better tolerated than metronidazole [^115qC39p].
- **Clinical response**: fever and pain typically resolve within 3–5 days; radiologic resolution lags and may take weeks to months [^112eXdRa].

---

### Luminal agents (post-nitroimidazole therapy)

Use **paromomycin** 25–35 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for 7 days [^1167cQew] or **diloxanide furoate** 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days to eradicate intestinal cysts and prevent recurrence [^113RKcyF].

---

## Indications for percutaneous drainage

Percutaneous drainage is **not routine** and is reserved for specific indications:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Large abscess (> 5 cm) | Risk of rupture and delayed resolution [^112iftB3] |
| Imminent rupture | Thin rim, subcapsular location, or crescent sign on imaging [^116pE379] |
| Failure of medical therapy | Persistent symptoms after 48–72 hours [^notfound] |
| Diagnostic uncertainty | Rule out pyogenic or mixed infection [^1113s3Mj] |

---

Percutaneous needle aspiration is effective for small abscesses, whereas **catheter drainage** is preferred for large or loculated abscesses [^112e5FYt].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgery is rarely required and is reserved for:

- **Rupture**: Intraperitoneal or intrathoracic rupture with peritonitis or empyema [^116pE379].
- **Hemorrhage**: Uncontrolled bleeding from abscess erosion into vessels [^116Dspow].
- **Failed drainage**: Persistent infection despite adequate drainage and medical therapy [^115VGWsL].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control.
- **Antiemetics**: For nausea and vomiting.
- **Hydration**: Intravenous fluids for dehydration or severe illness.
- **Nutritional support**: As indicated.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Track fever, pain, and liver function tests.
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT at 2–4 weeks to confirm resolution [^112eXdRa].
- **Luminal therapy**: Ensure completion to prevent recurrence [^111QqZUo].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent** with timely therapy, with near-universal recovery [^1147LTHe]. Complications include rupture, secondary bacterial infection, pleural effusion/empyema, and, rarely, portal vein thrombosis or hepatic failure [^11433hpG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Metronidazole is safe; avoid paromomycin in the first trimester.
- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require longer therapy and closer monitoring [^notfound].
- **Pediatric patients**: Similar regimen with weight-based dosing [^1173k89E].

---

Metronidazole or tinidazole are first-line therapy; **add a luminal agent** to prevent recurrence, and use percutaneous drainage or surgery only for specific indications.

## References

### Paromomycin sulfate [^115on7fp]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Paromomycin sulfate is indicated for intestinal amebiasis–acute and chronic (NOTE-It is not effective in extraintestinal amebiasis); management of hepatic coma–as adjunctive therapy.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Paromomycin Sulfate Capsules and other antibacterial drugs, Paromomycin Sulfate Capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Amoebic liver abscesses in Fiji: epidemiology, clinical presentation and comparison of percutaneous aspiration and percutaneous catheter drainage [^112iftB3]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is a common clinical problem in tropical countries related to poor sanitation. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of ALA in Fiji has not been previously described. It is unclear whether percutaneous aspiration (PA) or percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) has better outcomes.

Purpose

The aims were to describe the epidemiology and clinical presentation of ALA in Fiji and to compare the outcomes of PA and PCD for treatment of ALA.

Methods

A retrospective case note review of patients treated with either PA or PCD between 2010 and 2015 was performed. Indications for intervention were ALA > 5 cm, ALA in the left lateral lobe, risk of imminent rupture and failure to respond to medical treatment.

Results

There were 262 patients, 90% were male, 92.9% I-Taukei ethnicity and 86.2% regular recreational kava drinkers. Most presented with upper abdominal pain and fevers. The majority (90.3%) had a single abscess with 87.8% being in the right lobe. 174 (66.4%) had LA and 88 (33.6%) had PCD. There was an unintended selection bias for PA in abscess with a volume of < 1 litre. PA was associated with a more rapid resolution of fever and shorter hospital stay, more rapid resolution of the cavity and no morbidity. PCD had five complications, one bleed and four bile leaks. There was no mortality in either group.

Conclusions

ALA in Fiji occurs in I-Taukei males who drink kava. PA appears to offer equivalent if not better outcomes for treatment of ALA.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^1163oKL6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A liver abscess is a suppurative cavity in the liver resulting from the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms, entering directly from an injury through the blood vessels or by the way of the biliary ductal system. Liver abscesses are most commonly due to pyogenic, amebic or mixed infections. Less commonly these may be fungal in origin.

Liver abscess has been recognized since Hippocrates (circa 400 B.C.) who speculated that the prognoses of the patients were related to the type of fluid within the abscess cavity. Although amebic liver abscess occurs more commonly on a worldwide basis, the pyogenic liver abscess predominates in the United States.

Liver abscess is found more commonly in men between 20 and 40 years of age, but can occur at any age. Approximately 60% are solitary and mainly located in the right lobe of the liver, as a result of the streaming of portal blood flow secondary to the fact that the right lobe is predominantly supplied by the superior mesenteric vein, and because most of the hepatic volume is in the right lobe. When multiple abscesses are present, pyogenic or mixed is the most probable type. Patients usually present with a constant dull pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen which may be referred to the scapular region or the right shoulder. These patients usually have fever of between 38 o C and 40 o C.

Liver abscesses, both amebic and pyogenic, continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries. However, recent advances in interventional radiology, intensive care, progress in antibiotic therapy, and liberal use of sonography and computerized tomography scanning of the abdomen have led to early diagnosis and treatment of patients with liver abscess, thus improving the patient outcome. Percutaneous drainage of liver abscess has been an important advancement in the treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses.

The primary mode of treatment of amebic liver abscess is medical; however as many as 15% of amebic abscesses may be refractory to medical therapy. Also, secondary bacterial infection may complicate 20% of amebic liver abscesses. In such patients and in patients with pyogenic liver abscesses, surgical drainage has been the traditional mode of treatment. However, operative drainage is associated with significant (10–47%) morbidity and mortality.

### Endoscopic management of liver abscesses and cysts that communicate with intrahepatic bile ducts [^117Gcebp]. Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

The formation of a communication between liver abscesses or cysts and intrahepatic bile ducts is an uncommon cause of significant bile leak. Surgical management of biliary fistulas is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We performed a prospective study of endoscopic management of this type of biliary fistula.

Patients and Methods

We studied 26 patients who had either liver abscesses or hepatic cysts that had ruptured into the intrahepatic bile ducts. The presence of a biliary fistula was suspected by jaundice and/or by the appearance of bile in percutaneous drainage effluent from a liver abscess and was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Once the route of the fistula between the liver abscess or cyst and the intrahepatic bile duct had been defined by cholangiography, patients underwent treatment by sphincterotomy, and either biliary stenting or nasobiliary drainage. Nasobiliary drains or biliary stents (both 7 Fr) were placed according to standard techniques. Nasobiliary drains were removed when bile leakage stopped and closure of the fistula was confirmed by cholangiography; stents were removed after an interval of 4–6 weeks.

Results

Of a total of 525 patients with hepatic abscesses or cysts who were seen over a 5-year period, there were 26 patients who developed a demonstrable communication between liver abscesses (n = 20; 16 amebic, four pyogenic) or hydatid cysts (n = 6) and intrahepatic bile ducts (right intrahepatic bile ducts in 22 patients, left intrahepatic bile ducts in four patients). We performed either sphincterotomy with insertion of a nasobiliary drain (n = 20) or sphincterotomy with biliary stenting (n = 6). The fistulas healed in all patients after a mean time of 4 days (range 2–20 days) after endoscopic treatment. We were able to remove the nasobiliary drainage catheters and stents 6–34 days after their placement.

Conclusions

In this case series, endoscopic therapy appears to be an effective mode of treatment for biliary fistulas complicating liver abscesses and cysts.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^115hEowE]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Amebiasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess.

In amebic liver abscess, Metronidazole tablets therapy does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with metronidazole tablets therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to metronidazole tablets.

INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus), Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, and Peptostreptococcus species.

SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species.

GYNECOLOGIC INFECTIONS, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species.

BACTERIAL SEPTICEMIA caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group and Clostridium species.

BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS, (as adjunctive therapy), caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) INFECTIONS, including meningitis and brain abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS, including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

ENDOCARDITIS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole and other antibacterial drugs, metronidazole should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Treatment options for the eradication of intestinal protozoa [^1179dhkU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Pathogenic intestinal protozoa are responsible for clinically important infections in both the developed and the developing world. These organisms are responsible for both acute and chronic diarrhea, and Entamoeba histolytica, which affects the colon, can spread to involve the liver. Many of these pathogens, particularly the intracellular protozoa that predominantly affect the small intestine, produce their most devastating effects in patients with HIV/AIDS and other forms of immune deficiency. There are also various intestinal protozoa that do not seem to have any adverse effects on humans and can, therefore, be regarded as harmless commensal organisms. Although treatment has been available for several decades for giardiasis, isosporiasis and amoebiasis, until recently there have been no effective remedies for infection with intestinal coccidia — Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium and Cyclospora species. Cyclospora respond well to co-trimoxazole, microsporidia respond variably to albendazole, and cryptosporidia can often be eradicated by nitazoxanide. In chronically infected HIV-positive patients, treatment with multidrug regimens usually results in rapid resolution of the diarrhea and, in many instances, eradication of the parasite.

### Invasive amebiasis in men who have sex with men, Australia [^111aBwDv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The 2 patients with liver abscesses each had large, solitary abscesses in the right lobe of the liver (8 × 6 × 6 cm and 7.5 × 6.2 × 6.6 cm). In 1 patient, the abscess ruptured through the liver capsule, and collapse of the right middle and lower lung lobes and a resultant pleural effusion complicated the subphrenic collection of pus from the abscess. Levels of liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase), C-reactive protein, and neutrophils (absolute numbers) were raised. Both patients underwent percutaneous drainage of their liver abscess; cultures of aspirated pus were negative for bacteria and fungi. Results of indirect hemagglutination antibody assay were positive; titer was > 256. Microscopy and PCR of fecal samples were negative for E. histolytica. For these 2 patients with amebic liver abscess, the diagnosis was delayed; they had had symptoms for > 2 weeks and were then treated for bacterial liver abscess before the correct diagnosis was made.

All 5 patients made a successful recovery after treatment with metronidazole. In addition, all were treated for cyst carriage with paromomycin, a luminal amebicide.

### Amebic liver abscess and human immunodeficiency virus infection: a report of three cases [^116NjHsH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Invasive amebiasis rarely occurs in homosexual men and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and has not been regarded as a beacon for concomitant HIV infection. We encountered a bisexual man with a protracted course of amebic liver abscess and amebic colitis. In the presence of fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels, HIV infection was suspected and then confirmed by a de novo seroconversion of HIV antibody. Subsequently, we noted two consecutive patients with amebic liver abscess, also later found to be infected with HIV. The ameba obtained from these three cases was identified as Entamoeba histolytica by amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. This observation suggests that amebic liver abscess and colitis can be presentations for HIV infection in the Far East. Thus, the local patients with invasive amebiasis, especially those with a protracted course or with risk factors of HIV infection, should be tested for HIV.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1113s3Mj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Space-occupying lesions of the liver — diagnosis and microbiology testing focus on distinguishing parasitic from pyogenic causes: the primary diagnostic dilemma is differentiating parasites (Entamoeba histolytica and Echinococcus) from bacterial or fungal pyogenic abscesses; in endemic regions for E. histolytica, serology or serum antigen detection tests can be helpful to exclude amebic abscess, whereas stool examination is generally not. Liver aspirates may be submitted for direct microscopic evaluation for parasites. When amebic disease is unlikely, the abscess should be aspirated and the contents submitted in anaerobic transport for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures; the wall and abscess contents should be sampled when possible; aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture should be requested; and blood cultures can also be helpful if collected prior to antimicrobial therapy. Commonly recovered isolates include Klebsiella spp. E. coli, other Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas spp. Streptococcus spp. (including Streptococcus anginosus group), Enterococcus spp., viridans group Streptococci, S. aureus, Bacteroides spp. Fusobacterium spp. Clostridium spp., and rarely Candida spp.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^1141DyKj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Colonic ulcerations (small and large ulcers) were seen in 62 (77.5%) patients with ALA, these lesions were significantly more common in patients with multiple ALAs (91.6% vs. 71.4%, P = 0.03). Sachdev and Dhol reported colonic involvement in 58% of cases with ALA while Mishra et al reported colonic ulcerations in 55% of cases of ALA and it was more likely to occur in the presence of active diarrhea. The colonic ulcerations were more commonly small (< 3 cm) and they were commonly present in patients with multiple as compared to solitary ALA (P = 0.0004).

Liver hemodynamics is characterized by a dual venous and portal blood supply whose physiologic variations are particularly evident during digestion. In the normal subject portal blood flow is laminar with the right liver receiving the blood from the small intestine while the left liver is supplied by the blood from the spleen and colon. Because the colon is the primary site of infection by parasites, it is likely that colonic lesions may be the portal of entry. The parasite may traverse through the colonic lesion to the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and then finally through the right or left portal vein into the liver parenchyma. In the present study right colon was universally involved in patients with ALA with colonic involvement. Cecum involvement (70.9%) was seen commonly followed by right colon plus transverse colon (35.4%) and isolated ascending colon (22.5%). There was a significant involvement of the transverse colon along with right colon in the patients comprising multiple ALAs as compared to patients with solitary ALA (P = 0.0002). This study for the first time shows a correlation of patchy involvement of colonic mucosa beyond the hepatic flexure might act as a portal of entry to SMV and IMV, and may finally lead to multiple ALAs either in right lobe or in both lobes of liver. This justifies the previous hypothesis of liver hemodynamics that portal blood flow is streamlined or laminar with the right liver receiving blood from the small intestine and the left liver receiving blood from the spleen and colon.

### Amebic liver abscess in Israeli travelers: a retrospective study [^116kV4Yo]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Amebic liver abscess (ALA) is endemic in developing countries. The epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the disease in developing countries are well described. Travelers from nonendemic countries can serve as a model for the natural history of ALA. Currently, the available literature on travelers is limited. This is a retrospective observational study on Israeli travelers diagnosed with ALA. Data regarding travel history, clinical presentation, imaging, and treatment were collected and analyzed. Among 6,867 ill returning Israeli travelers, amebiasis was diagnosed in 53 travelers (0.77%), of whom 14 were with ALA (0.2%). Twelve ALA cases (86%) had an exposure in the Indian subcontinent. The male to female ratio was 1:1, with no significant clinical differences between the sexes. The average lag period between exposure and onset of symptoms was 17.1 months. The lack of male predominance and the prolonged lag period may imply that behavioral factors are pivotal in the development of ALA. Larger case series of travelers are required.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: imaging findings [^113YhoCv]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common extraintestinal manifestation of the disease is a liver abscess. Symptoms of liver abscess are fever, right upper quadrant pain, and tenderness. Amebic abscesses are predominantly solitary, oval or round shaped, and located near the liver capsule in the right lobe of the liver. Sonographic features of amebic abscess consist of a hypoechoic lesion with low-level internal echoes and the absence of significant wall echoes. On CT scan, it is seen as a low-density lesion with a peripheral enhancing rim thickened wall. A mild contrast enhancement around the abscess in the adjacent liver parenchyma occurs due to the peripheral zone of edema. Amebic liver abscess is frequently together with right-sided pleural effusion and perihepatic fluid.

### Non-neoplastic hepatopancreatobiliary lesions simulating malignancy: can we differentiate? [^114u3BQo]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic and amebic liver abscesses

Hepatic abscesses may be secondary to fungal, bacterial, or amebic infections. Pyogenic abscesses represent the vast majority of these abscesses with Escherichia coli and Clostridium species being the common causative agents. Solitary hepatic abscesses are often cryptogenic with no clear-cut source to be identified. CT typically shows a hypoattenuating cystic lesion with surrounding parenchymal edema (Fig. 7). This parenchymal edema is a very useful sign for differentiating pyogenic abscesses from cystic metastases. However, it should also be noted that some solitary liver abscesses may present as mostly solid lesions with no identifiable underlying risk factor. Without perilesional edema and typical septations, liver abscess may be difficult to recognize (Fig. 8). Also, the presence of fever is not a universal feature of liver abscesses, further complicating diagnosis. The absence of centrally progressing contrast enhancement on delayed phase images and progressive enhancement in the outermost layer corresponding to the fibroinflammatory capsule of the abscess may be helpful for differentiating mostly solid appearing pyogenic abscesses from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. It is also difficult to differentiate necrotic liver tumors from abscesses. Nodularity in the internal surface of the lesion wall, focal calcifications within the lesion, and the absence of perilesional edema favors necrotic neoplasm over an abscess. Follow-up imaging after empirical treatment for liver abscess may also be implemented as an alternative approach for differential diagnosis. However, morphological changes may also be observed during the natural course of the disease without any therapeutic intervention. In patients where no diagnosis could be achieved in a noninvasive manner, percutaneous biopsy may be utilized for definitive treatment planning.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^1162kYin]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

Eighty patients were divided into two groups, one with solitary (70%) and the other with multiple ALAs (30%). Mean age was 36.6 years with a strong male predisposition (M:F = 9:1). Risk factors were present in 35% cases of ALA and included alcohol intake > 40 g/day (22.5%) and presence of diabetes mellitus (12.5%). Risk factors were commonly associated with multiple ALAs (Table 1). However no case of HIV with ALA was seen during the study period. Most of the patients had symptom duration of 2–4 weeks and no patient was seen with symptoms beyond 6 weeks. Most of the patients with multiple ALAs were symptomatic within 2 weeks. Pain in right hypochondrium was the most common symptom (97%), followed by fever (95%) and nausea/vomiting (25%). Diarrhea was present in less than one fourth of the patients (22.5%). Jaundice was seen in only 5% and was more common in patients with multiple ALAs, although statistically non-significant. Most of the patients had a high total leukocyte count and mildly raised alkaline phosphatase, but were comparable in both the groups. ELISA test with an anti amebic titer > 1:160 was taken as positive for Entamoeba histolytica. The titer had been validated in other studies conducted in India, however a titer greater than 1:400 is considered strong for ALA. Stool for cyst and trophozoites were positive in only 4 (5%) patients. It was seen only among the patients with active or recent diarrhea.

Baseline characteristics

ALA

Solitary ALA was seen in 56 (70%) subjects whereas multiple ALAs in 24 (30%) subjects. Most of the lesions were localized in the right lobe of liver (85%), the left lobe was involved in 10% and there was bilobar involvement in 5% cases (Table 2). Twenty cases (83.3%) of multiple ALAs had only involvement of the right lobe of liver, whereas in the remaining 4 cases (16.7%) there was bilobar involvement. In solitary ALA, the right lobe of liver was involved in 85.7% and left lobe involvement was seen in 16.3%. There was no case of multiple ALAs involving only the left lobe of liver.

Clinically the patient was in complete remission for her tumor and her prior abdominal scan was normal. She was asymptomatic and had no fever. a Axial plane T2W MR image demonstrates a moderately hyperintense focal lesion (arrows) in the right liver lobe. b Axial plane postcontrast T1W MR image at the late arterial phase demonstrates marked ring enhancement in the periphery of the lesion (arrows) which was considered to be highly suspicious for an adenocarcinoma metastasis. Percutaneous biopsy did not demonstrate any neoplastic cells but was interpreted as an abscess. Follow up CT scan (not shown) after intense IV antibiotic treatment showed complete disappearance of the lesion

Amebic abscesses are caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. In around 70% of the cases, a solitary abscess within the right liver lobe is detected. US typically shows a round or oval shaped, hypoechoic lesion without any significant wall echoes. On contrast enhanced CT, amebic abscess usually may appear as round shaped, hypoattenuating lesions with ill-defined borders (Fig. 9). An enhancing wall and a peripheral edema are also a common feature. Also, septations may be seen within the abscess cavity.

### Development of amoebic liver abscess in early pregnancy years after initial amoebic exposure: a case report [^114cbp5m]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Entamoeba histolytica and associated complications are relatively rare in developed countries. The overall low prevalence in the Western world as well as the possibly prolonged latency period between infection with the causing pathogen and onset of clinical symptoms may delay diagnosis of and adequate treatment for amoebiasis. Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of invasive amoebiasis. Pregnancy has been described as a risk factor for development of invasive amoebiasis and management of these patients is especially complex.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old Caucasian woman in early pregnancy presented to our emergency department with abdominal pain alongside elevated inflammatory markers and liver function tests. Travel history revealed multiple journeys to tropic and subtropic regions during the past decade and a prolonged episode of intermittently bloody diarrhea during a five month stay in Indonesia seven years prior to admission. Sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 5 × 4 cm hepatic abscess. After ultrasound-guided transcutaneous liver drainage, both abscess fluids and blood cultures showed neither bacterial growth nor microscopic signs of parasitic disease. Serological testing confirmed an infection with Entamoeba histolytica, which was treated with metronidazole, followed by eradication therapy with paromomycin. Subsequent clinical, laboratory and imaging follow-up exams showed regression of the ALA. In addition, the pregnancy completed without complications and a healthy baby boy was born 7 months after termination of treatment.

Conclusions

This case of invasive amoebiasis in early pregnancy outside of endemic regions and several years after exposure demonstrates the importance of broad differential diagnostics in the context of liver abscesses. The complex interdisciplinary decisions regarding the choice of imaging techniques as well as interventional and antibiotic therapy in the context of pregnancy are discussed. Furthermore, we present possible explanations for pregnancy as a risk factor for an invasive course of amoebiasis.

### Amebic liver abscess in HIV-infected patients, republic of Korea [^115Fat8s]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Amebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common extraintestinal complication of amebic infection. Although loss of cellular immunity is thought to play a role in infection by the pathogen, whether HIV infection is also a risk factor for invasive amebiasis is controversial. ALA in HIV-infected patients has not been well characterized, although several case series have been reported. We report the role of HIV infection status in ALA in an area where ALA is not endemic and the clinical features of ALA in HIV-infected patients.

All patients with ALA at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) from January 1990 through December 2005 were identified; some have been previously reported. SNUH is a 1,600-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital and the largest referral center for HIV/AIDS in the Republic of Korea. The diagnostic criteria for ALA were radiologic evidence of intrahepatic abscess, trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica in fluid aspirated from an abscess, or absence of bacteria and fungi in aspirated fluid and a titer ≥ 128 in an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for E. histolytica.

### Case report: spontaneous resolution of intracavitary hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm caused by amebic liver abscess following percutaneous drainage [^115dEaS9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Intrahepatic pseudoaneurysm (IHPA) is generally iatrogenic, and it warrants urgent management because of its reportedly significant risk of rupture leading to considerable mortality. Intrahepatic pseudoaneurysm caused by amebic liver abscess (ALA) is exceedingly rare with fewer than seven published reports. All reported symptomatic cases have been treated with hepatic artery embolization; therefore, little is known about its natural course and effect of abscess drainage on its outcome. We report the first case of symptomatic intracavitary IHPA caused by ALA in which ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage of the abscess resulted in the spontaneous resolution of the IHPA.

14.3 Intestinal Amebiasis

Tinidazole use in intestinal amebiasis has been documented in 26 published reports from the world literature involving over 1,400 patients. Most reports utilized tinidazole 2 g/day × 3 days. In four published, randomized, controlled studies (1 investigator single-blind, 3 open-label) of the 2 g/day × 3 days oral dose of tinidazole, reported cure rates after 3 days of therapy among a total of 220 subjects ranged from 86% (25/29) to 93% (25/27).

14.4 Amebic Liver Abscess

Tinidazole use in amebic liver abscess has been documented in 18 published reports from the world literature involving over 470 patients. Most reports utilized tinidazole 2 g/day × 2–5 days. In seven published, randomized, controlled studies (1 double-blind, 1 single-blind, 5 open-label) of the 2 g/day × 2–5 days oral dose of tinidazole accompanied by aspiration of the liver abscess when clinically necessary, reported cure rates among 133 subjects ranged from 81% (17/21) to 100% (16/16). Four of these studies utilized at least 3 days of tinidazole.

### Clinical manifestations and risk factors of amebic liver abscess in southeast Taiwan compared with other regions of Taiwan [^113mMd3x]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

Amebic liver abscess (ALA) had previously been endemic in Taiwan, particularly in the southern region, although its occurrence in the southeastern area was unknown. Thus, we conducted a retrospective study for southeastern Taiwan. We identified 14 patients who were diagnosed with ALA between July of 1995 and July of 2008. These patients were predominantly male and older in age. Most patients lived in rural areas (85.7%). Alcoholism (78.6%) and diabetes (35.7%) were risk factors for ALA. No human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections were detected. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (100%) and abdominal pain (100%). Short mean durations of symptoms, high bilirubin levels, and low albumin levels were also noted. Most patients (92.86%) had a single lesion, particularly in the right liver lobe (71.4%). Six patients also had secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial infections. Clinicians should be aware of the different risk factors in different regions when diagnosing amebic liver abscess in Taiwan.

### Pyogenic and amebic infections of the liver [^1147LTHe]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyogenic liver abscesses are classified by the bacteria that have caused the abscess because this guides treatment and can point to the underlying cause. The most common cause is biliary disease. The diagnosis is made by imaging. Treatment is a combination of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. Amebic liver abscess is caused by extraintestinal spread of Entamoeba histolytica. E histolytica is spread by fecal-oral transmission and typically colonizes the gastrointestinal tract. It is diagnosed based on imaging and the mainstay of treatment is metronidazole. Only about 15% of cases require percutaneous drainage. The prognosis is good, with almost universal recovery.

### Metronidazole [^114mrBkD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amebiasis. Metronidazole tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess.

In amebic liver abscess, metronidazole tablets therapy does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections. Metronidazole tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with metronidazole tablets therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to metronidazole tablets.

INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus), Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, and Peptostreptococcus species.

SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species.

GYNECOLOGIC INFECTIONS, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species.

BACTERIAL SEPTICEMIA caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group and Clostridium species.

BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS, (as adjunctive therapy), caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS, including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

ENDOCARDITIS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole tablets and other antibacterial drugs, metronidazole tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^111Xfahv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Type of abscess

Amebic liver abscesses were encountered more frequently (58%) compared to pyogenic (23%), amebic abscesses with secondary bacterial infection (7%) and abscesses of indeterminate etiology (12%) (Tables 3A, 3B).

Table 3A
Type of abscess (showing amebic serology and pus culture)

Table 3B
Type of abscesses in each group

Location of the abscess

The majority (about 80%) of the abscesses were located in the right lobe of liver, 15% in the left and 7% in both lobes (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Location of abscess

Number of abscess

Three quarters of the cases studied were found to have solitary liver abscess cavity, whereas the rest of the patients had multiple abscesses.

Volume of the abscess

It was observed that the volume of the abscess cavities was mostly between 150–350 mL (Table 4).

Table 4
Volume of the abscesses

Interventions and their results (Table 5)

A total of 60 patients underwent either of the two percutaneous procedures randomly and their response to treatment was recorded and analyzed (Table 5). Pigtail percutaneous drainage was successful in all the 30 cases. On the other hand, image-guided needle aspiration was successful only in 23 of 30 patients (P = 0.006). Out of these 23 patients successfully treated, 9 patients required only one aspiration, 10 required two aspirations, and 4 required three aspirations. The 7 patients who did not show clinical improvement and / or decrease in cavity size despite 3 aspirations were taken as failures. In the PNA group, on comparing the cavity volumes the mean cavity volume in those who were successfully treated was 201.4 cc which was significantly less than those failing treatment; the mean volume being 403.6 cc (P < 0.011). The patients in PCD group showed earlier clinical improvement (P = 0.039) and 50% decrease in abscess cavity volume (P = 0.000) as compared to those who underwent PNA. However, there was no significant difference between the duration of hospital stay or the time required for total or near-total resolution of cavity.

### Preoperative transcatheter arterial embolization for spontaneous rupture of huge amebic liver abscess with massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage [^116Dspow]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

An 18-year-old male developed a huge liver abscess with severe anemia over the course of 2 weeks. Abdominal contrast enhanced computed tomography showed ruptured huge liver abscess in the right liver lobe with signs of active hemorrhage (contrast extravasation). Serology examination confirmed amoeba as the suspected pathogen of cause. Angiography was performed followed by transcatheter arterial embolization to localize and control the hemorrhage. Embolization using a combination of polyvinyl alcohol and gelfoam successfully controlled the active hemorrhage. Exploratory laparotomy was performed to evacuate and debride the huge abscess. Metronidazole was given and showed good results. Huge liver abscess size is a predictor of conservative management failure and requires a gradual step-up intervention. The purpose of this paper is to explain the importance of imaging in detecting liver abscess and active hemorrhage along with the role of interventional radiology in this case.

### Traced to the paste [^111QnhGg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Question: A 57-year-old male from southwest Texas with travel only to Taiwan 1 month prior develops new onset fever and abdominal pain. Stool microscopy is negative. Imaging and lesion aspirate is shown. What is the diagnosis?

Answer: Amebic liver abscess.

A 57-year-old male originally from El Paso, Texas, with travel limited to Taiwan 1 month prior presented to our hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. He admitted to consumption of night market food while in Taiwan. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and elevated liver associated enzymes. Contrast enhanced computed tomography utilizing a multiphasic liver protocol revealed hepatic abscess in the right lobe measuring 3.6 × 4.7 × 4.1 cm (Figure 1). Intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole were initiated empirically. Because of persistent fever and concern for pyogenic liver abscess, aspiration was pursued. Classic "anchovy paste" material was discovered (Figure 2). Stool microscopy and baseline amebiasis antibodies were notably found to be negative. Stool and abscess fluid were subsequently tested utilizing the FilmArray TM enteric polymerase chain reaction panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT). Both samples were positive for Entamoeba histolytica. Routine abscess cultures were negative for bacterial coinfection. The patient completed courses of metronidazole and paramomycin with complete recovery. Entamoeba histolytica serology converted to positive and repeat imaging confirmed resolution of the abscess at follow-up.

Computed tomography demonstrating amebic liver abscess in the right hepatic lobe.

Figure 2.
Aspirate of "anchovy paste" from the liver abscess. This figure appears in color at.

Invasive amebiasis can be life threatening and early pathogen detection and treatment are of paramount importance. Traditional diagnostics such as light microscopy have low sensitivity and E. histolytica serology can specifically be falsely negative early in the course of the disease. Although not widely available, molecular techniques have quickly been recognized as the diagnostic standard and have been used to diagnose amebic liver abscess in several reports. This case highlights the pitfalls in utilizing conventional diagnostics as well as the utility of multiplex PCR to rapidly diagnose extraintestinal amebiasis.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^114BaWYo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

A case control study was conducted at the Department of Gastroenterology, SNMC Jodhpur over a period of 12 months from June 2012 to May 2013. Ninety two patients were enrolled in the study; 12 patients were excluded. Two patients did not give consent for colonoscopy while full length colonoscopy could not be done on 4 patients. One patient developed spontaneous right pleural communication following rupture and was managed by percutaneous intercostal drainage tube placement. Five patients had impending rupture and had to be treated with percutaneous drainage tube placement. Finally, 80 patients were included, comprising 56 patients with solitary (70%) and 24 patients with multiple ALAs (30%). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical college. After written consent was obtained in accordance with the Helsinki declaration, patients were counselled and explained about the objectives of the study by a qualified medical doctor. Detailed personal history was taken using a standard questionnaire and a 5 mL blood sample was collected. Inclusion criteria comprised presence of clinical features suggestive of ALA (fever, right upper abdominal pain, tender hepatomegaly); ultrasonography finding of single or multiple hypoechoic lesion(s) in the liver and elevated anti-amebic antibody titer (IgG > 160, immunofluorescent assay). Diagnosis was established by the presence of all the three clinical, imaging and serological parameters. Exclusion criteria included sick patients who were unfit for colonoscopy, patients receiving anti-amebic treatment in the preceding 8 weeks and patients who denied consent. A detailed clinical history of diarrhea in the recent past (8 weeks) and presence of risk factors (alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and human immunodeficiency virus status) were recorded.

Colonoscopy was performed in all patients at admission or within 48 h of starting anti-amebic treatment. In all 80 patients, colonic preparation was performed by ingestion of a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution. Colonoscopy was performed with the patient under conscious sedation (Diazepam 5–10 mg or Midazolam 2–3 mg) administered intravenously. During colonoscopy a detailed mucosal lesion of erythema and ulcers were noted, and if ulceration was present then details of size, location and surrounding inflammation of the ulcers were recorded. Ulcer size less than 3 cm was considered discrete or small whereas size more than 3 cm was considered large. Ulcer size was determined using an endoscopic measuring wire designed for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram to assess length (Wilson-Cook). Multiple biopsy specimens were obtained from the ulcer margins and histopathological examination was done.

### Hepatobiliary infections [^115v2hUA]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The major hepatobiliary infections (excluding the viral hepatitides) include amebic and pyogenic liver abscess and cholangitis. Little new information has been published in the area of cholangitis during the last several years. In contrast, the clinical presentation and management of liver abscess have evolved considerably, not only in the last several years but also during a more extended period spanning the last two decades. In the United States, amebic liver abscess occurs largely in individuals from endemic areas or in those traveling to endemic areas. Recent data suggest that patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at an increased incidence of amebic liver abscess. New serologic tests and molecular techniques are being added to the diagnostic armamentarium for amebic liver abscess. In most cases, amebic liver abscess is associated with an excellent prognosis (up to 100% survival) if properly managed. Pyogenic liver abscess, although commonly occurring in patients with known biliary tract disease, is often cryptogenic in origin (ie, no clear causal factor can be identified) or often is caused by underlying medical disorders. An emerging population of patients with pyogenic liver abscess includes those with complications of aggressive interventions (hepatic chemoembolization, cryoablation, liver transplantation). Pyogenic liver abscess was predominantly managed by surgical methods up until the early 1980s, but almost entirely has changed to being managed by interventional techniques; in 2000, this trend has continued. In contrast to amebic liver abscess, pyogenic liver abscess is associated with greater morbidity and mortality, ostensibly caused by the severity of the underlying disease in many patients. However, it should be emphasized that the prognosis of patients with pyogenic liver abscess, who do not have underlying comorbid conditions, is excellent.

### Treatment of an amebic liver abscess with intravenous metronidazole… [^1159pzTq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A case of amebic liver abscess was treated in which the abscess was not visualized by hepatic ultrasonography, thus delaying the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy. The abscess was surgically drained because of imminent rupture. Postoperatively, the patient was unable to take oral medications and was successfully treated with intravenously administered metronidazole. Hepatic ultrasonography should not be relied on to rule out liver abscesses. We suggest that parenteral metronidazole should be considered as an alternate therapy to dehydroemetine in patients who are not able to take oral medications. Kovaleski T, Malangoni MA, Wheat LJ.

### Amoebic dysentery [^115PGPAh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amoebic dysentery is caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. It is transmitted in areas where poor sanitation allows contamination of drinking water and food with faeces. In these areas, up to 40% of people with diarrhoea may have amoebic dysentery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of drug treatments for amoebic dysentery in endemic areas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: emetine, metronidazole, ornidazole, paromomycin, secnidazole, and tinidazole.

### Amebic liver abscess [^114Wqmu6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

A 45 year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of constant right upper quadrant abdominal pain, 20-lb weight loss, and worsening fevers. The patient had immigrated to the United States from Mexico 7 years earlier. She was febrile, experienced pain with light palpation of the right upper quadrant, and had normal serum transaminases, normal alkaline phosphatase, and mildly elevated total bilirubin of 1.1 mg/dL. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed contiguous peripherally enhancing, thick-walled, hypodense hepatic dome abscesses measuring 9.5 × 6.1 cm (Figures 1 and 2) Entamoeba histolytica serology was positive, and the size of the lesions halved after 4 days of metronidazole and symptoms rapidly resolved. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan that can cause asymptomatic colonization, amebic colitis, or extraintestinal abscesses.–Transmission of infective cysts is fecal-oral, and patients usually have a history of exposure from an endemic area. Symptoms include a history of fever and right upper quadrant pain. Diagnosis can be aided with imaging studies and confirmed with serological studies and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Invasive disease should be treated with metronidazole for 10 days and paromomycin to eliminate colonization for 7 days. In rare cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.

AMA Arch Surg. 1951; 62: 260–274. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.1951.01250030265008 WHEN one searches for a plan of therapy for amebic abscess of the liver in 1950, the adjunctive use of antibiotics is expected to be in that plan. Leonard Rogers1 actually formulated the basis of modern therapy by proving that Endamoeba histolytica was the etiological agent and that emetine was specific for the disease. He reduced the mortality rate from 57 to 14 per cent by the introduction of emetine as the antiamebic and of the more conservative closed aspiration drainage instead of open drainage, which prior to this time had been associated with dangerous sequelae. The excellent 1943 monograph by Ochsner and DeBakey2 remains the actual guide, although their plans were largely concerned with surgery and antiamebics and not with antibiotics.

Sporadic reports concerning the adjunctive role of the use of antibiotics with promising results have recently appeared. 3 It may be superfluous to add that antibiotics should accompany any plan of therapy Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Metronidazole oral (Likmez) [^115wvYBq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Trichomoniasis

LIKMEZ is indicated for the treatment of:

Symptomatic trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis in adult females and males when the diagnosis is confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures.
Asymptomatic trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis in adult females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion.

Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, treat sexual partners of patients simultaneously to prevent re-infection.

1.2 Amebiasis

LIKMEZ is indicated for the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amoebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess in adults and pediatric patients. In amebic liver abscess, treatment with LIKMEZ does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^1137QGGq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amebiasis is an infection with intestinal protozoa Entamoeba histolytica. More than 85% of infections are asymptomatic and the remaining 10% produce a clinical spectrum ranging from dysentery to abscesses of liver (ALA) or other organs. Amebiasis constitutes an important global problem in the tropics and subtropics, affecting approximately 12% of the world's population at any time. Various risk factors such as poor hygiene, diabetes mellitus, steroid overuse, chronic alcoholism and human immunodeficiency virus infection have been known to predispose to the development of ALA. Most patients present with an acute illness and duration of symptoms lasting less than 2 weeks. The main presenting features are abdominal pain, fever, and anorexia. It primarily affects the colon but the liver is the most common extraintestinal organ involved. The parasite has been shown to be carried to the liver from the large bowel via the portal venous system. Hence one would expect the colon to be effected in all cases of ALA, but diarrhea is observed only in one third. It is possible that most patients with ALA have asymptomatic involvement of the colon. In an autopsy series by Aikat et al, ulceration of the large bowel was seen in 59% of cases of liver abscess. Sachdev and Dhol reported colonic involvement in 58% of cases with ALA. In a more recent study by Mishra et al colonic ulcerations were seen in 55% of cases of ALA and it was more likely to occur in the presence of active diarrhea or in the recent past. The site of liver abscess is determined by the point of entry of the parasite in the colon, because of streamlining of blood flow in the portal venous system. However, recent studies have not found any association between the site of the colonic lesions and location of abscesses in the liver. Therefore, a study was conducted to find the correlation between colonic involvement in solitary and multiple ALAs.

### Liver abscess in children-experience from a single tertiary care center of north India: etiology, clinical profile and predictors of complications [^114QDcnT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver abscess (LA), a common problem in children in the tropics, is believed to be mostly pyogenic (PLA), sometimes amebic (ALA). We aimed to analyze the clinical profile, etiology, risk factors for complications, management and outcomes of LA in children.

Methods

The details of 81 children with LA managed in a tertiary set up over a period of 3 years were analyzed. A comparison of different parameters was performed with respect to etiology and complications.

Results

ALA, PLA and mixed infection LA were diagnosed in 40 (49.4%), 32 (39.5%) and 9 (11.1%) children. The triad of fever, hepatomegaly and right upper quadrant tenderness was seen in 65 (80.2%). Coagulopathy was observed in 60 (77%) and jaundice in 12 (14.8%). Majority (71.6%) had a single LA in the right lobe (69%). Conservative, percutaneous needle aspiration, percutaneous catheter drainage and surgical drainage were done in 11.1%, 3.7%, 82.7% and 2.5%, respectively. Forty-three (53.1%) had complicated LA with rupture in 55.8% and vascular thrombosis in 16.2%. Children with complicated LA had higher alanine transaminase, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, low serum protein and albumin levels (P < 0.05). Median duration of follow-up was 2 months and mean time to resolution of LA was 48.5 ± 18 days.

Conclusions

ALA is the commonest cause of pediatric LA in endemic regions and is difficult to differentiate from PLA clinically. Percutaneous catheter drainage is safe and effective modality for the management of LA in children. A higher alanine transaminase, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio and low serum albumin levels (< 3g/dL) at presentation identify complicated LA.

### Experience with intravenous metronidazole to treat moderate-to-severe amebiasis in Japan [^116XeVF8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Twenty-eight cases of either intestinal amebiasis, amebic liver abscess, or both, most of which were of moderate-to-severe intensity, were treated with intravenous metronidazole, pioneered by the Research Group on Chemotherapy of Tropical Diseases, Japan. This study was not conducted as a formal clinical trial, and all patients either underwent colectomy for intestinal amebiasis, received oral metronidazole, or both. Despite these limitations, intravenous metronidazole was shown to be well tolerated and seemed to be very effective. This agent should be more widely recommended than previously thought for treating moderate-to-severe amebiasis, especially its intestinal form.

### Benign and malignant focal liver lesions displaying rim arterial phase hyperenhancement on CT and MRI [^113gQFY9]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Amebic liver abscess in a 68-year-old man who presented with fever and right upper quadrant pain. Contrast-enhanced MRI using an extracellular contrast shows a large focal liver lesion, with (a) high SI on T2-weighted images, showing a "double target sign" with an iso- to hypointense inner layer and a hyperintense outer layer on T2-WI. The lesion shows (b) high SI on DWI (b = 800), (c) a peripheral low signal on the ADC map. d On the AP, the lesion demonstrates a thin-rim APHE, that persists (e) on the portal venous and (f) delayed phases

Alveolar echinococcosis

Echinococcus multilocularis is responsible for the rare alveolar echinococcosis. Alveolar echinococcosis occurs by either ingesting food or plants containing the eggs from the Echinococcus tapeworm or by direct contact with the definitive hosts, foxes. The liver is the most common site of infection (> 90% of patients). The lesion may be single or may appear as small, multilocular confluent heterogeneous cysts associated with solid components that demonstrate exogenous growth invading the adjacent hepatic parenchyma; a large cystic component is also frequently observed. CT and MRI typically show multiple irregular, ill-defined lesions containing hypoattenuating areas of necrosis and active parasitic tissue hypoattenuating on CT and hyperintense on T2-WI on MRI, which show mild rim APHE or no contrast enhancement of the solid component. The key imaging finding is the coalescence of multiple small cystic lesions in a single larger cavity ("cluster sign") (Fig. 4). Hilar infiltration is common and results in dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and invasion of the portal and hepatic veins, with subsequent atrophy of the affected liver segments due to hypoperfusion.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^111MG5xF]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis:

In the Female:

One-day treatment − two grams of metronidazole tablets, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given in the same day.

Seven-day course of treatment − 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 500 mg or 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approx. 500 mg for a 70-kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^116HGRUZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Of 7 patients who did not respond to PNA, 6 improved on PCD and 1 was lost to follow up. But these patients were not included in the PCD group as success. Of these 7 patients, 2 were amebic, 3 were pyogenic and 2 were secondary infection; of 3 pyogenic abscesses, Escherichia coli was seen in 1 and Klebsiella in 2 patients.

It can be said that in recent years image-guided percutaneous treatment (needle aspiration or catheter drainage) has replaced surgical intervention as the primary treatment for liver abscess.

The major advantages of PNA over PCD are: 1) it is less invasive and less expensive; 2) avoids problems related to catheter care; and 3) multiple abscess cavities can be aspirated easier in the same setting. However, in our study we had a success rate which was significantly lower than with catheter drainage (77% versus 100%, P = 0.006). There are some problems with catheter drainage like nuisance to the patient, pain, cellulites at the insertion site and sometimes catheter dislodgement.

The success rate of PNA in the literature varies from 79–100%. The success rate in our study after single aspiration was 30%, after second aspiration 63% and after third aspiration it was 77%. Although, needle aspiration is a much simpler procedure when compared to catheter drainage repeated procedures are quite unpleasant and traumatic for the patients and may not be acceptable to many. Even after repeated aspirations the success rate was far from being 100%. Therefore, those patients who failed after a third aspiration attempt were offered catheter drainage.

The average size of abscess in our study was 302 ± 122 mL and 249 ± 121 mL for the PCD and PNA group respectively, comparable to the study reported by Rajak et al (335 mL and 221 mL respectively). The success rate achieved by Rajak et al was 60%, comparable to the success rate after the second aspiration in our study, i.e. 63%. Subsequent aspirations seem to improve the success rate of therapy.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^112e5FYt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Complications such as hemorrhage, pleural effusion/empyema, persistent bile drainage, catheter displacement, sepsis etc. have been reported with both PNA (4% in series of Baek et al) and PCD (12% in the series of Lambiase et al). Baek et al and Giorgio et al described the much lower incidence of complications with PNA than with PCD as one of the major advantages of needle aspiration over catheter drainage. However, in our study and some recent studies (Rajak et al 1998, Yu et al 2004), both the procedures were found to be safe if performed properly with minimal complications. There was no mortality in either of the study groups.

Singh and Kashyap, 1989 reported a 15% incidence of secondary bacterial contamination after repeated needle aspirations; however, others (Baek SY et al, Giorgio et al, Rajak et al) have not encountered this problem. Although secondary bacterial infection remains a possibility with indwelling drainage catheters this complication has been rarely reported in liver abscess.

One limitation of our study is that the etiology of abscess was not uniform and formed a heterogeneous group with abscesses of both amebic and pyogenic etiology existing in both groups. Also, about 12% of the abscesses were of indeterminate etiology. Anaerobic culture was not performed and no studies to detect fungus were done.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Image-guided percutaneous treatment (aspiration or catheter drainage) has replaced surgical intervention as the procedure of choice
If performed carefully, both the procedures are safe with minimal complications

What the new findings are:

Percutaneous catheter drainage is a better modality as compared to percutaneous needle aspiration
Each repeated aspiration improved the success of treatment by percutaneous needle aspiration
Significantly earlier clinical improvement (P = 0.039) and less time for 50% reduction in abscess cavity (P = 0.000) in the percutaneous catheter drainage group
The chances of failure of percutaneous needle aspiration increased with the increase in size of abscess cavity to be aspirated (P = 0.011)
There was no significant advantage of catheter drainage over needle aspiration in terms of duration of hospital stay and time needed for total or near total resolution of abscess cavity

### Complications after interventional sonography of focal liver lesions: a 22-year single-center experience [^112TEDni]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the complications of diagnostic and therapeutic sonographically guided interventional procedures of focal liver lesions observed during a 22-year period in a single center.

Methods

Complications of sonographically guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedures on focal liver lesions, observed during a 22-year period in a single center, were reviewed. From 1979 to 2001, 13,222 patients (age range, 7–89 years; mean, 59 years; 8,688 male and 4,534 female) with 13,777 focal liver lesions underwent 16,648 sonographically guided biopsies and 3,035 therapeutic procedures: pyogenic and amebic abscess aspiration, ethanol injection of hydatid liver cysts, and percutaneous ablative treatments (ethanol injection in either multiple or one-shot sessions, radio frequency ablation, and interstitial laser photocoagulation) of primary and secondary liver tumors.

Results

The overall mortality was 0.06%. No death or major complication occurred after diagnostic procedures and liver abscess drainage. In the therapeutic group mortality was 0.6%: 1 patient died of anaphylactic shock during treatment of a hydatid cyst; 7 patients died after liver tumor ablation with ethanol injection (6 after one-shot treatments and 1 after multisession treatments). Major complications after liver tumor ablative procedures included 10 cases of acute liver failure, 2 cases of acute tubular necrosis, 2 cases of self-limiting hemoperitoneum, 2 cases of paralytic ileum, 2 abscesses, and 1 case of cholangitis. One case of a biliary cyst fistula and 1 case of intracystic hemorrhage occurred after treatment of hydatid liver cysts.

Conclusions

Sonographically guided diagnostic biopsy of focal liver lesions and liver abscess drainage are safe procedures. In contrast, liver tumor ablation procedures have a low but definite risk of mortality and major complications. Puncture of hydatid cysts must be performed only in institutions that can treat anaphylactic shock.

### Unusual presentation of amoebic liver abscess with pseudohaemoptysis [^114f8kVq]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Amoebic liver abscesses, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, can rarely rupture into the pleural space, leading to massive pseudohaemoptysis. We report a case of a patient who presented with severe haemoptysis, later diagnosed with a ruptured amoebic liver abscess. Despite a negative pus culture, a positive E. histolytica IgM test confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was managed with intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone, along with pigtail catheter drainage, leading to a full recovery. This case highlights the importance of considering hepatic abscess rupture in unexplained haemoptysis and emphasises the role of serological testing when cultures are inconclusive. Prompt antimicrobial therapy and drainage are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^111hyd5h]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

ALA may present as an acute process or as a chronic indolent disease. Most patients present with acute illness and duration of symptoms of less than 2 weeks. In the present study, most of the patients with solitary ALA presented with symptoms for 2–4 weeks compared to less than 2 weeks duration in patients with multiple ALAs. The main presenting features were abdominal pain (97%), fever (95%), and anorexia/nausea (25%). Abdominal pain is usually moderate and localized to the right upper quadrant or to the epigastrium. Diarrhea was present in less than one fourth of the patients (22.5%), comparable to previous studies. Stool for trophozoites or cysts was seen in only 5% patients, suggesting that most of the active colonic infection disappears by the time patients present with ALA. Jaundice was more commonly seen in cases of multiple ALAs compared to cases of solitary ALA. Overall jaundice was seen in 5% of cases with ALA. Previous studies have shown that during the course of illness one-third of patients may develop clinical jaundice. Severe jaundice is usually due to a large abscess or multiple abscesses, or to an abscess situated at the porta hepatis. In the present study, 70% of cases pertained to solitary and the rest 30% multiple ALAs with right lobe of liver involvement in 85%, left lobe in 10% and bilobar involvement in 5% cases. Right lobe of liver was commonly involved in both solitary and multiple ALAs. This is similar to those observed in other studies in India showing that ALAs usually occur in the right lobe of the liver and are solitary (30–70%), while 15% of patients may have multiple ALAs.

### Long-term follow-up of pyogenic liver abscess by ultrasound [^112eXdRa]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To study the morphology of residual abscess in successfully treated pyogenic liver abscess by ultrasound.

Methods

116 consecutive patients of liver abscess diagnosed from April 2004 to March 2007 were included in this study. Patients with amebic liver abscess were excluded. Patients were treated with antibiotics for 6 weeks and when indicated drained percutaneously. Ultrasound scan was repeated after 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months of treatment. Thereafter it was repeated every 6 months.

Results

After exclusion, 102 patients with > 150 lesions were studied. Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical presentation, ultrasound examination and diagnostic aspiration. It was single in 83, double in 12 and more than 2 in seven patients. Size varied from 4.2cm to 15cm. Organisms were isolated in 29 patients (E. coli 10, Kliebsiella sp. 6, S. aureus 5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Acenetobacter 1 and multiple growth 5) in blood and eight patients (E. coli 5 and S. aureus 3 and multiple growth 2) in pus. Majority of abscess resolved sonologically after 2–18 weeks of treatment. Healing was delayed in alcoholic and diabetic patients. In eight patients there was residual abscess even after 104 weeks of follow-up. In four patients it healed with calcification.

Conclusions

Majority of pyogenic liver abscess resolve to normal parenchyma within 18 weeks time. However, some lesions may take longer time to heal even after successful treatment. It should be considered in differential diagnosis of space occupying lesion of the liver in ultrasound and need no therapeutic intervention.

### Tinidazole [^1177zH3Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Amebiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) in adult women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### A high-throughput drug screen for entamoeba histolytica identifies a new lead and target [^115nv5s4]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan intestinal parasite, is the causative agent of human amebiasis. Amebiasis is the fourth leading cause of death and the third leading cause of morbidity due to protozoan infections worldwide(1), resulting in ~70,000 deaths annually. E. histolytica has been listed by the National Institutes of Health as a category B priority biodefense pathogen in the United States. Treatment relies on metronidazole(2), which has adverse effects(3), and potential resistance of E. histolytica to the drug is an increasing concern(4,5). To facilitate drug screening for this anaerobic protozoan, we developed and validated an automated, high-throughput screen (HTS). This screen identified auranofin, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used therapeutically for rheumatoid arthritis, as active against E. histolytica in culture. Auranofin was ten times more potent against E. histolytica than metronidazole. Transcriptional profiling and thioredoxin reductase assays suggested that auranofin targets the E. histolytica thioredoxin reductase, preventing the reduction of thioredoxin and enhancing sensitivity of trophozoites to reactive oxygen-mediated killing. In a mouse model of amebic colitis and a hamster model of amebic liver abscess, oral auranofin markedly decreased the number of parasites, the detrimental host inflammatory response and hepatic damage. This new use of auranofin represents a promising therapy for amebiasis, and the drug has been granted orphan-drug status from the FDA.

### Right basal bronchial fistula due to amebic infection: a case report [^113aFXQX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old male was referred to our hospital for liver abscess, right pleural effusion, and body weight loss (31 kg within 6 months). He had no past medical history. Laboratory tests revealed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and amebic infection (both untreated) using real-time PCR and western blot. Because the patient had dyspnea and his blood gases showed desaturation, we inserted a thoracostomy tube to reduce the massive pleural effusion. The pleural effusion was anchovy paste-like and we detected Entamoeba histolytica, which was also found in his stool. Although the patient had persistent air leakage, he did not cough up pus. The liver abscess was treated conservatively. HIV treatment was initiated, and the amebiasis was treated concurrently with metronidazole followed by paromomycin (10 days, respectively). While the pleural fluids subsequently became serous, the air leakage persisted. Computed tomography (CT) suggested a bronchopleural fistula of the right basal bronchus (Fig. 1), whereas the liver abscess was no longer visible. Roughly 2 months after HIV treatment initiation, his HIV-RNA copy number had decreased and was within the safe range. His general condition was improved dramatically, and his body weight increased to 69.5 kg. He then underwent open right lower lobectomy, during which a fistula between the bronchus and lung abscess was detected (Fig. 2 A). The diaphragm was intact, and there was no sign of a ruptured liver abscess involving the thoracic cavity. The duration of surgery was 150 min, and the blood loss was 100 ml. Pathological findings revealed a right basal bronchial fistula in the perforated lung abscess (Fig. 2 B). The chest drainage tube was removed on postoperative day 2. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 and was in good condition at the 1-year follow-up.

### A rare hepatic mass in an Italian resident [^111DooTd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amebiasis is a rare condition in developed countries but epidemiologically growing. Clinical manifestation may range from asymptomatic to invasive disease, amoebic liver abscess being the most common manifestation. We report a peculiar case of left hepatic amoebic liver abscess in a patient without a well-known source of infection and presenting with left portal vein thrombosis.

Case Presentation

Patient, working as longshoreman, presented with complaints of remittent-intermittent fever lasting from 2 weeks. Physical examination was normal. Blood tests showed mild anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated inflammation markers. Chest x-rays was normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed multiple hypoechoic liver masses. CT-scan of abdomen showed enlarged left liver lobe due to the presence of large abscess cavity along with thrombosis of left portal vein. The indirect hemagglutination test for the detection of antibodies to Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) was positive. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage revealed "anchovy sauce" pus. Metronidazole and a follow up imaging at 3 months showed resolution of abscess cavity.

Conclusion

This case shows that amoebic liver abscess is possible even in first world country patients without travel history. Left sided abscess and portal vein thrombosis are rare and hence reported.

### Entamoeba histolytica infection in men who have sex with men [^111QqZUo]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Entamoeba histolytica infection (amoebiasis) is the second leading cause of death from parasitic diseases. Epidemiological studies from developed countries have reported an increasing prevalence of amoebiasis and of invasive infections, such as amoebic colitis, among men who have sex with men (MSM) who engage in oral-anal sex. Although most infections with E histolytica are asymptomatic, clinical manifestations of invasive amoebiasis mainly include amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscess, which are associated with substantial morbidity and medical cost. Laboratory diagnosis of amoebiasis should be based on detection of E histolytica by use of tests with high sensitivity and specificity, such as specific amoebic-antigen or PCR-based assays. Microscopy used in routine clinical laboratories is not sensitive or specific enough for detection of E histolytica. Metronidazole or tinidazole remains the mainstay of treatment for invasive amoebiasis, followed by treatment with luminal agents to prevent relapse and transmission of E histolytica to sexual partners or close contacts.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^116pE379]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver abscess

Pyogenic liver abscesses develop secondary to ascending cholangitis, hematogenous dissemination, or pylephlebitis following intra-abdominal infections such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis. The incidence is higher in middle-aged or elderly patients who present with low-grade evening fever, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, tender hepatomegaly, and elevated white blood cell count.

Infectious abscesses on contrast-enhanced CT demonstrate a peripherally enhancing rim surrounding a central low attenuation area, and then an outer low attenuation zone secondary to perilesional parenchymal edema, producing the characteristic "double target" sign. The presence of gas within an abscess is a strong indication of gas-producing species. Treatment options for pyogenic liver abscesses include antibiotic therapy and percutaneous or open drainage. Long-term antibiotic therapy alone (> 3 weeks) can be applied in patients with single small (< 3 cm) liver abscesses. Percutaneous catheter drainage combined with antibiotics has been associated with success rates exceeding 97% and more rapid clinical improvement. Ahmed et al studied 40 patients with pyogenic liver abscesses measuring > 10 cm in diameter. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 98% of patients, with 1 patient requiring subsequent open drainage and 3 patients undergoing secondary percutaneous drainage procedures. Complications (mostly minor) were observed in 25% of patients and there was 1 death. Open surgical drainage comes into play for patients who fail to respond to the above treatment, as well as in patients with peritonitis or complex, septated, and multiloculated abscesses.

Amoebic abscess is the most common extracolonic manifestation of amebiasis. Patients present with hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, diarrhea, history of travel to an endemic area and positive serology. Unlike pyogenic abscesses, amoebic abscesses rarely need therapeutic drainage and are quite effectively managed with oral metronidazole administered for 7–10 days. Percutaneous or surgical drainage may be necessary in up to 15% of cases, to manage enlarging superficial abscesses (with high risk of rupture), bacterial superinfections, or when metronidazole treatment fails.

Candida abscesses are usually encountered in immune-compromised patients. CT scans show multiple low-attenuation lesions, with a typical enhancing rim and frequent involvement of the spleen. In patients who fail to improve after drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics, antimycotic therapy should be considered early, before the onset of fungemia.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^113BCAcu]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Abscess penetration

Although there have been limited studies on drug penetration into KLA abscesses, in vivo studies with bacterial abscesses at various anatomical locations have shown that antibiotic penetration into an encapsulated purulent abscess is restricted and largely influenced by the antibiotic class and the level of abscess maturation. The ability of a drug to penetrate the abscess wall depends on the lipophilicity (lipid solubility) of the antibiotic (Fig. 1). Fluoroquinolones and macrolides have high lipophilicity and readily cross membranes, including abscess walls, more effectively than the hydrophilic β-lactams or aminoglycosides. Human and animal pharmacokinetic data indicate that fluoroquinolones, effectively penetrate abscesses. Interestingly, a recent study reported patients suffering with KLAs had shorter hospital stays and required less intravenous antibiotic therapy when treated with fluoroquinolones compared to those treated with β-lactams. The reasons for this are not known but could be at least partially attributed to the hydrophilic nature of β-lactams, which could limit their accumulation inside abscesses compared to lipophilic fluoroquinolones. While fluoroquinolones could be an effective treatment option for KLA infections, their effectiveness is increasingly compromised by rising rates of resistance, particularly in convergent strains.

### Tinidazole: a nitroimidazole antiprotozoal agent [^116kpcUC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Tinidazole, a structural analogue of metrondazole, is an antiprotozoal agent that has been widely used in Europe and developing countries for > 2 decades with established efficacy and acceptable tolerability. It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess.

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties and clinical usefulness of tinidazole.

Methods

Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966-August 2005), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-August 2005), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2005) using the terms tinidazole, Fasigyn, and nitroimidazole.

Results

In vitro, tinidazole exhibits activity against pathogenic protozoa (eg, Tricbomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba bistolytica, Giardia duodenalis), a wide range of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria (eg, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile), and the microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori. In susceptible protozoal and bacterial cells, tinidazole is reduced to cytotoxic intermediates that covalently bind to DNA, causing irreversible damage. In human adults, tinidazole had a bioavailability of 100% and a V(d) of 50.7 L, was minimally bound to plasma protein (12%), had a plasma elimination t((1/2)) of 12.3 hours, and was eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism (approximately 63%). Dose adjustment does not appear to be necessary on the basis of race, sex, or renal function. No data were found on the disposition of tinidazole in patients with hepatic insufficiency; therefore, use of tinidazole in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) is not recommended. Clinical cure rates in patients with trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess were generally > 90%. In comparative trials, tinidazole was as effective as metronidazole in the treatment of trichomoniasis and was significantly more effective than metronidazole in the treatment of giardiasis (P < 0.05) and amebiasis (P < 0.05). The most commonly reported (> 1%) adverse effects included bitter taste, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, vomiting, and fatigue. The recommended dosage of tinidazole is a single dose of 2 g for trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and 2 g/d for 3 to 5 days for amebiasis.

Conclusions

Tinidazole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria and H pylori.

### Amebic acute appendicitis: systematic review of 174 cases [^11788mvS]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to determine the clinical and demographic features of acute amebic appendicitis by reviewing the reported cases.

Methods

The PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched to identify articles related to amebic appendicitis using key words. The search included all articles published between 1935 and 2012 without restricting language, journal, or country.

Results

A total of 174 cases of amebic appendicitis reported in 42 articles were analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 23.5 years (range 2 months-83 years). The majority of patients were male (74.0%), and the majority of cases were reported from countries with high/moderate risk for amebiasis (76.5%). A history of traveling to a high/moderate-risk country was cited in 64.0% of the overall cases. The interval between travel and onset of clinical symptoms ranged from months to years. History of or coexisting dysenteric diarrhea was present in only 7.0 and 14.0% of overall cases, respectively. A preoperative diagnosis of amebiasis was cited for only five cases (3.0%). Complicated appendicitis was present in 30.7% of cases, some of which required colon resection. Severe postoperative intraabdominal complications (e.g., liver abscess, abdominal sepsis, gastrointestinal fistula, hemorrhage) occurred in 19.4% of surgery-treated patients. The overall mortality rate was 3.2%.

Conclusion

Appendectomy specimens should be routinely sent for histopathologic examination. In the case of suspected amebic acute appendicitis, extra precautions-early appendectomy, metronidazole for antibiotic prophylaxis, wet-preparation examination, obtaining a timely pathology result, increasing the awareness of uncommon complications of appendectomy-can hasten appropriate therapeutic intervention and improve outcome.

### Amebiasis and amebic liver abscess in children [^113RKcyF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Although rare in the developed world, amebiasis continues to be a leading cause of diarrhea and illness in developing nations with crowding, poor sanitation, and lack of clean water supply. Recent immigrants or travelers returning from endemic regions after a prolonged stay are at high risk of developing amebiasis. A high index of suspicion for amebiasis should be maintained for other high-risk groups like men having sex with men, people with AIDS/HIV, immunocompromised hosts, residents of mental health facility or group homes. Clinical presentation of intestinal amebiasis varies from diarrhea to colitis and dysentery. Amebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis. Various diagnostic tools are available and when amebiasis is suspected, a combination of stool tests and serology should be sent to maximize the yield of testing. Treatment with an amebicidal drug such as metronidazole/tinidazole and a luminal cysticidal agent such as paromomycin for clinical disease is indicated. However, for asymptomatic disease treatment with a luminal cysticidal agent to decrease chances of invasive disease and transmission is recommended.

### Clinical characteristics and management of liver abscess in the Gambia, a resource-limited country [^1146WX4D]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This retrospective cohort study conducted in the Gambia, a low-resource country, found that liver abscess predominantly affects mostly males with clinical, laboratory, and radiological features consistent with late presentation. In spite of this and the lack of diagnostic and material resources, morbidity and mortality rates in this cohort were low. This suggests that the current strategy of antibiotic therapy combined with percutaneous abscess drainage is a reasonable treatment strategy for the management of liver abscess in resource-poor settings.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^111nVkU9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess (ALA) occurs in more than half of the patients. However no studies have found any association between the site of the colonic lesions and location of abscesses in the liver. Thus, the present study was designed to find the correlation between colonic involvement in solitary and multiple ALAs.

Methods

This is a case control study of 80 patients allocated in two groups, the first with solitary (controls) and the second with multiple ALAs (cases). Colonoscopy was performed in all patients enrolled in the study.

Results

Solitary ALA was seen in 70% of patients whereas multiple ALAs in 30%. Colonic involvement in the form of erythema, inflammation and ulceration was seen in 77.5% of cases of ALA. 71.4% cases of solitary ALA had colonic lesions compared to 91.6% cases of multiple ALAs (P = 0.02). Most of the patients with multiple ALAs had involvement of the transverse and right colon (75%). Involvement of right colon was present in all patients with colonic involvement. A significant involvement of the right and transverse colon was seen in cases of multiple compared to solitary ALA (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Colonic involvement is present in more than two thirds of patients with ALA. When colonic involvement is present, right colon lesion is universally present. Colonic involvement may extend beyond hepatic flexure in patients with multiple amebic ALAs, either involving right hepatic lobe or both lobes.

### Development of amoebic liver abscess in early pregnancy years after initial amoebic exposure: a case report [^1113LrPD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging modalities need to be chosen with care in the pregnant patient. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines recommend ultrasound and MRI as the modalities of choice. In our setting, MRI without contrast was performed after initial ultrasound assessment; subsequently, the accessibility of the abscess enabled successful ultrasound-guided drainage. Thus, imaging with ionizing radiation could be avoided. Given other circumstances, such as typical symptoms of intestinal amoebiasis including recent fever and bloody diarrhea as well as a patient presenting in or coming from a geographic region with higher prevalence of amoebiasis, imaging could be restricted to abdominal ultrasound followed by sole diagnostic puncture instead of placement of a drainage catheter. In our case, initial uncertainty about the nature of the hepatic lesion, the clinical symptoms including right upper quadrant abdominal pain as well as the high CRP-value in a pregnant patient justified the catheter drainage.

Aspiration or catheter drainage of ALA in addition to the antimicrobial therapy to hasten clinical resolution is not mandatory in uncomplicated ALA in the setting of rather small size (< 5 cm diameter) and no risk factors for abscess rupture (e.g. marginal abscess with limited amount of liver tissue around the abscess formation). The material aspirated from an ALA, mainly consisting of liquified liver tissue, is in itself of limited diagnostic value as trophozoites can only be microscopically detected in a minority of aspirates (< 20%). With varying sensitivity and specificity of both microscopic and immunological diagnostic tools, novel and promising PCR-based diagnostic methods have been developed that enable the fast rule-in or rule-out of a variety of parasites, including E. histolytica (as reviewed by Ryan et al. and Madden et al.). However, there are neither standardized PCR protocols nor commercially available detection kits, resulting in varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity of the often applied in-house protocols. Further improvement of molecular diagnostic methods as well as enhanced accessibility in developing countries may facilitate diagnosis of invasive amoebiasis in general as well as ALA in particular.

### Amebic liver abscesses among neonates can mimic bacterial sepsis [^114wvCdW]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Amebic liver abscesses are unusual among neonates. Three (3.6%) of 83 children who presented to a university hospital with amebic liver abscesses in a 17-year period were neonates (< 28 days of age). Patients presented with nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings mimicking fulminant neonatal sepsis. Diagnosis was delayed and was based on the presence of a hypoechoic lesion in the liver, antibodies against Entamoeba histolytica and microbiologic examination of pus. In addition to parenteral metronidazole treatment and early ultrasound-guided aspiration of the abscess, intensive care is vital for the treatment of neonates with amebic liver abscesses.

### Amebic abscess of the liver with secondary infection… [^11426NoW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Amebic abscesses of the liver may be divided into two groups from the standpoints of therapy and prognosis. The first group is composed of those without secondary bacterial infection. The accepted method of therapy in this group is the administration of emetine hydrochloride, usually combined with aspiration of the abscess. Open drainage is contraindicated, since it causes a higher fatality rate, chiefly because of the unavoidable postoperative bacterial invasion of the abscess. In a collected series of 5, 000 cases, Ochsner and DeBakey1 report a fatality rate of 5. 6 per cent for the cases treated by the closed method and
43. 1 per cent for the cases treated by open drainage. The second group consists of amebic abscesses which have become secondarily infected with bacteria of various types. In these cases the prognosis is much worse, and the accepted surgical treatment is essentially the same as for other pyogenic hepatic abscesses. Noth PH, Hirshfeld JW.

### Immunization with the entamoeba histolytica surface metalloprotease EhMSP-1 protects hamsters from amebic liver abscess [^111mJ5nG]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

Diarrhea and amebic liver abscesses due to invasive Entamoeba histolytica infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Entamoeba histolytica adherence and cell migration, two phenotypes linked to virulence, are both aberrant in trophozoites deficient in the metallosurface protease EhMSP-1, which is a homologue of the Leishmania vaccine candidate leishmanolysin (GP63). We examined the potential of EhMSP-1 for use as a vaccine antigen to protect against amebic liver abscesses. First, existing serum samples from South Africans naturally infected with E. histolytica were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of EhMSP-1-specific IgG. Nine of 12 (75%) people with anti-E. histolytica IgG also had EhMSP-1-specific IgG antibodies. We next used a hamster model of amebic liver abscess to determine the effect of immunization with a mixture of four recombinant EhMSP-1 protein fragments. EhMSP-1 immunization stimulated a robust IgG antibody response. Furthermore, EhMSP-1 immunization of hamsters reduced development of severe amebic liver abscesses following intrahepatic injection of E. histolytica by a combined rate of 68% in two independent animal experiments. Purified IgG from immunized compared to control animals bound to the surface of E. histolytica trophozoites and accelerated amebic lysis via activation of the classical complement cascade. We concluded that EhMSP-1 is a promising antigen that warrants further study to determine its full potential as a target for therapy and/or prevention of invasive amebiasis.

### Metronidazole oral (Likmez) [^1173k89E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Trichomoniasis

Adult Female and Male Patients:

One-day Treatment – Administer 2 g (20 mL) of LIKMEZ, either as a single oral dose or in 2 divided oral doses of 1 g (10 mL) each, given on the same day.
Seven-day Course of Treatment − Administer 250 mg (2.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally 3 times daily for 7 consecutive days.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment may help improve compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen.

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. There are some data from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

When repeat courses of LIKMEZ are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Amebiasis

Adult Patients:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): Administer 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.
For amebic liver abscess: Administer 500 mg (5 mL) or 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.

Pediatric Patients:

Administer 35 mg/kg/24 hours to 50 mg/kg/24 hours of LIKMEZ, divided into three doses, to a maximum dose of 2,250 mg/24 hours (maximum dose 750 mg/dose or 7.5 mL/dose), orally for 10 days.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for tropical disease: implications for clinical decision-making [^113HpdVG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

So, why is the article by Husan et al. on ultrasound appearing in a tropical medicine journal?As tropical medicine physicians, we are best positioned to understand the value of context in a patient's presentation. We can ask why does this patient present with these symptoms in this place? Knowing how diseases differ in different parts of the world is what we do best.

The study by Husan et al. was undertaken in Southeast Asia, where melioidosis is relatively common. The differential diagnosis for a liver abscess seen by ultrasound is fairly extensive and includes diseases such as brucellosis, alveolar echinococcosis, fascioliasis, amebic abscess, bacterial abscess, and fungal infection, to name just a few. A similar study in Africa, with different patterns of disease, would not have yielded the same findings. In Africa, a patient presenting with fever and a liver abscess would more likely have either an amebic or bacterial abscess. If characteristic central calcification was seen, then brucellosis might be suspected. Around Lake Victoria, periportal fibrosis in the liver would be highly suspicious of a Schistosoma mansoni infection, and double-walled liver cysts in southern Italy would suggest E. granulosus infection. Thus, in a different geographical environment, the specific protocol mentioned in this article might lead to different conclusions. We should embrace this ambiguity rather than feel uncomfortable with it. This is what we are trained to do in tropical medicine. We use the distribution of a disease to help us make decisions.

Point-of-care ultrasound is not a tool that is designed to yield a definitive diagnosis. It is a tool that helps to refine a differential diagnosis based on the image and the context. Finding solid organ abscesses in the liver, spleen, or prostate of a diabetic patient with fever in Laos should prompt empiric treatment for B. pseudomallei. Ultrasound will not always be the answer, of course. Studies of other common diseases that cause fever in Southeast Asia such as dengue and malaria have not demonstrated clear utility of ultrasound in helping with either diagnosis or treatment. –

This article adds to our growing understanding about how point-of-care ultrasound should be used to guide treatment decisions in patients with undifferentiated fever, in particular in tropical settings with limited resources. Different locations and the diseases that occur in these locations may lead to similar patterns of ultrasound findings identifying different diseases. It is up to us as clinicians to put all of the information together, synthesize that information, and make the best treatment decisions.

### Branch portal vein pyaemia secondary to amoebic liver abscess [^114Yu5RX]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of a young returning traveller who contracted amoebic dysentery while visiting India. She presented to a major London Hospital several months later with features suggestive of amoebic liver abscesses, a known sequelae of amoebiasis. MRI with intravenous contrast demonstrated an area of likely occlusion of the portal vein. The patient was treated with intravenous metronidazole for 10days followed by diloxanide furoate, an intraluminal agent. The largest abscess was drained acutely under ultrasound guidance. The portal vein occlusion was treated medically without the use of anticoagulation. A repeat ultrasound at 6weeks post-treatment confirmed patency of the portal vein indicating spontaneous recanalisation with antimicrobial therapy alone.

### Tinidazole (Tindamax) [^113MiEze]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Amebiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) in adult women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### Image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess [^111zYgVt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Metronidazole is the standard of care for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses (considering that complicated liver abscesses are those localized in left lobe, multiple, and/or pyogenic abscesses). However, a subset of patients with amoebic liver abscesses remain symptomatic, with a significant risk of rupture of the abscess into the peritoneum. The role of image-guided percutaneous therapeutic aspiration in these patients remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1988 to September 2007), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to September 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing an image-guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

Inclusion criteria, trial quality assessment, and data extraction were done in duplicate. We calculated relative risks (RR) and mean differences, and checked for heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots and chi-squared and I(2) tests.

Main Results

Seven low quality randomised trials were included. All studies included a total of 310 patients, but due to selective outcome reporting bias, less patients could be included in our analyses. Pooled analysis of three homogenous trials showed that needle aspiration did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with fever resolution (RR 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.61). Sensitivity analysis according to trial quality preserved these findings. Trials that evaluated resolution of abdominal pain, days to resolution of fever, pain, resolution of abscess cavities, reduction in liver size, and duration of hospitalisation were heterogeneous. The benefits in the number of days to resolution of pain (MD -1.59, 95%CI -2.73 to -0.42), number of days to resolution of abdominal tenderness (MD -1.70, 95%CI -2.86 to -0.54), and duration of hospitalisation (MD -1.31, 95%CI -2.05 to -0.57) were observed in the needle aspiration group only.

Authors' Conclusions

Therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence. The trials lack methodological rigour and adequate sample size to conclude on the presence of effectiveness of adjunctive image-guided aspiration plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone. Further randomised trials are necessary.

### Antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis [^115qC39p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Infection with the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and up to 100,000 people with severe disease die every year. Adequate therapy for amoebic colitis is necessary to reduce illness, prevent development of complicated disease and extraintestinal spread, and decrease transmission.

Objectives

To evaluate antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis.

Search methods

We searched the available literature up to 22 March 2018. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, m RCT, and conference proceedings. We contacted individual researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and we checked reference lists.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials of antiamoebic drugs given alone or in combination, compared with placebo or another antiamoebic drug, for treating adults and children with a diagnosis of amoebic colitis.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials and extracted and analysed the data. We calculated clinical and parasitological failure rates and rates of relapse and adverse events as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random‐effects model. We determined statistical heterogeneity and explored possible sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We carried out sensitivity analysis by using trial quality to assess the robustness of reported results.

Main results

In total, 41 trials (4999 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this review. In this update, we added four trials to the 37 trials included in the first published review version. Thirty trials were published over 20 years ago. Only one trial used adequate methods of randomization and allocation concealment, was blinded, and analysed all randomized participants. Only one trial used an E histolytica stool antigen test, and two trials used amoebic culture.

Tinidazole may be more effective than metronidazole for reducing clinical failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; 477 participants, eight trials; low‐certainty evidence) and is probably associated with fewer adverse events (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 477 participants, 8 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). Compared with metronidazole, combination therapy may result in fewer parasitological failures (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86; 720 participants, 3 trials; low‐certainty evidence), but we are uncertain which combination is more effective than another. Evidence is insufficient to allow conclusions regarding the efficacy of other antiamoebic drugs.

Authors' conclusions

Compared with metronidazole, tinidazole may be more effective in reducing clinical failure and may be associated with fewer adverse events. Combination drug therapy may be more effective for reducing parasitological failure compared with metronidazole alone. However, these results are based mostly on small trials conducted over 20 years ago with a variety of poorly defined outcomes. Tests that detect E histolytica more accurately are needed, particularly in countries where concomitant infection with other bacteria and parasites is common.

### Treatment of liver abscess: prospective randomized comparison of catheter drainage and needle aspiration [^115VGWsL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The pus cultures were negative in 42 of 60 patients. Aerobic cultures were declared negative after 48 h of incubation. There were 8 patients (12%) in whom the amebic serology as well as pus cultures were negative. As several of our patients prior to reporting to our hospital had been given antibiotics as well as antiamebic drugs, this might explain the finding of 12% cases with indeterminate etiology. Similar experience has been reported by other researchers as well.

The most frequently isolated bacteria on pus culture was Escherichia coli (44%) closely followed by Klebsiella species (33%). Escherichia coli has been reported to be the organism most frequently grown in western series. However, Asian series have reported Klebsiella to be the most frequently isolated bacteria.

We performed image-guided percutaneous intervention in 60 patients with uncomplicated liver abscess and obtained good results. There was no mortality or any major complication requiring any treatment. Several researchers have employed both the modalities, i.e. PNA as well as PCD with varying degrees of success. Several groups have documented that significant number of patients can be managed with a combination of systemic antibiotics and percutaneous drainage with excellent results.

Many solitary and some carefully selected macroscopic multiple abscesses are amenable to percutaneous abscess drainage. Surgical drainage is usually reserved for patients who have failed percutaneous drainage, those who require surgery for management of underlying problems, and some patients with multiple macroscopic abscesses.

Several groups have reported reasonably good results with PNA along with systemic antibiotics. Giorgio et al performed on an average 2.2 aspirations in 115 patients and reported resolution of symptoms and hepatic lesions in 98% of the patients. In our study we treated 30 patients with PNA along with systemic antibiotics. Of these 30 patients, 23 were successfully treated with 9 requiring only one aspiration, 10 requiring a second aspiration and 4 patients requiring a third aspiration as well. 7 of these 30 patients failed to improve clinically and did not show significant decrease in abscess cavity even after 3 aspirations. Thus, 23 patients who were successfully treated with aspiration required an average of 1.8 aspirations. The mean duration of time taken for clinical improvement was 5.5 ± 1.9 days in this modality of treatment. Rajak et al reported a success rate of 60% with needle aspiration. However, in their study only two attempts of aspiration were made and failure to attain clinical, hematological and radiological improvement was taken as failure of therapy.

### Antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis [^114xvbZi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica is common in low- and middle-income countries, and up to 100,000 people with severe disease die every year. Adequate therapy for amoebic colitis is necessary to reduce illness, prevent development of complicated disease and extraintestinal spread, and decrease transmission.

Objectives

To evaluate antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis.

Search Methods

We searched the available literature up to 22 March 2018. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, mRCT, and conference proceedings. We contacted individual researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and we checked reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of antiamoebic drugs given alone or in combination, compared with placebo or another antiamoebic drug, for treating adults and children with a diagnosis of amoebic colitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials and extracted and analysed the data. We calculated clinical and parasitological failure rates and rates of relapse and adverse events as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random-effects model. We determined statistical heterogeneity and explored possible sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We carried out sensitivity analysis by using trial quality to assess the robustness of reported results.

Main Results

In total, 41 trials (4999 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this review. In this update, we added four trials to the 37 trials included in the first published review version. Thirty trials were published over 20 years ago. Only one trial used adequate methods of randomization and allocation concealment, was blinded, and analysed all randomized participants. Only one trial used an E histolytica stool antigen test, and two trials used amoebic culture. Tinidazole may be more effective than metronidazole for reducing clinical failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; 477 participants, eight trials; low-certainty evidence) and is probably associated with fewer adverse events (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 477 participants, 8 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with metronidazole, combination therapy may result in fewer parasitological failures (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86; 720 participants, 3 trials; low-certainty evidence), but we are uncertain which combination is more effective than another. Evidence is insufficient to allow conclusions regarding the efficacy of other antiamoebic drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with metronidazole, tinidazole may be more effective in reducing clinical failure and may be associated with fewer adverse events. Combination drug therapy may be more effective for reducing parasitological failure compared with metronidazole alone. However, these results are based mostly on small trials conducted over 20 years ago with a variety of poorly defined outcomes. Tests that detect E histolytica more accurately are needed, particularly in countries where concomitant infection with other bacteria and parasites is common.

### Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess: does site matter? [^1151hV33]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion the present study demonstrates that colonic involvement is present in more than two thirds of patients with ALA. When colonic involvement is present, a right colon lesion is universally present. Colonic involvement may extend beyond the hepatic flexure in patients with multiple ALAs, either involving the right or both lobes of the liver.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess occurs commonly
Colonic lesions in amebic liver abscess involve cecum and ascending colon
Portal of entry of the parasite by superior or inferior mesenteric vein

What the new findings are:

Colonic involvement in amebic liver abscess occurs in more than three quarters of cases
Amebic liver abscess with colonic lesion have universal involvement of cecum or ascending colon
Colonic involvement may extend beyond hepatic flexure in multiple amebic liver abscesses

### Amebic liver abscess diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction in 14 returning travelers [^115cNveo]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Amebic liver abscesses (ALA) are not commonly described in travelers. The ALA diagnosis is usually based on serology and Entamoeba histolytica polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a new tool. We retrospectively reviewed all ALA cases diagnosed by PCR on the liver abscess pus aspirate of patients admitted in 4 teaching hospitals in Paris, France between 2007 and 2011. Fourteen cases (10 male, median age 48 years) were included. The median lag time between return and onset of symptoms was 23 days among 10 patients (interquartile range [IQ] 18–24) whereas the remaining patients had travelled over 2 years ago. All patients had an elevated C-reactive protein level, and 11 had leukocytosis. The ALA was multiple in five patients, localized in the right lobe in 12, and higher than 5 cm in 11. Serology was initially negative in one patient, whereas PCR was positive. There was bacterial co-infection in one patient. The outcome was good. Liver puncture allows a rapid diagnosis of ALA with PCR and helps identify the association with a bacterial dual infection.

### Metronidazole (Flagyl) [^113q2udw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis

In the Female: Seven-day course of treatment (375 mg two times daily for seven consecutive days).

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain treatment. Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis:

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (approximately 500 mg for a 70 kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

Discussion

Liver abscess is a major tropical disease of the gastrointestinal system. The liver abscess is mainly classified into amebic and pyogenic. Pyogenic liver abscess which used to be mainly tropical in location is now more common due to increased biliary interventions, stenting, A total of 60 patients underwent either of the two cholecystitis, cholangitis etc. Liver abscess is 3 to 10 times percutaneous procedures randomly and their response more common in men. In our study we found the male to female ratio to be 7: 1. The most frequently affected age group was in the third and fourth decade.

The clinical presentation of the patients studied in our series was similar to the descriptions in previous reports. The common symptoms and signs of liver abscess in our study were fever (88%), right upper quadrant pain and tenderness (93%) and hepatomegaly (80%). These clinical manifestations are similar to those described in previous studies.

In our study, 78% of the abscesses were located in the right lobe of liver, similar to previous studies, and 77% of our patients had solitary abscesses, similar to a previous report. We encountered multiple liver abscesses in 23% of the patients, similar to the 20–25% incidence of multiple liver abscesses reported by Sharma et al.

The type of abscess was determined on the basis of amebic serology and pus culture reports. In our study we found 58% of the abscesses to be amebic in etiology, 23% to be pyogenic, 12% to be indeterminate and 7% to be amebic with secondary bacterial infection (or mixed liver abscess, MLA). Khan et al in their series reported 68% amebic, 21% pyogenic, 8% indeterminate, and 3% MLA. The use of serological testing for diagnosis of amebic liver abscesses can occasionally lead to either false negative results early in the course of the disease, due to delay in rise of antibody titer, or to false positives due to background subclinical amebic infections. Consideration of high titers for diagnosis may help exclude these false positives.

### Development of amoebic liver abscess in early pregnancy years after initial amoebic exposure: a case report [^113QUkT4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Metronidazole and the structurally similar tinidazole are the therapeutic agents used for treatment of acute infection with E. histolytica. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for pregnant women. Metronidazole is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category B drug, is generally well tolerated and although it crosses the placenta it seems to have no significant embryotoxic effects. The initial situation with pending serology results required additional therapy with i.v. ceftriaxone. Differentiation between amoebic and bacterial liver abscess by clinical and imaging findings is not possible and a bacterial abscess may be caused by metronidazole-unresponsive bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. or Klebsiella spp. which warrant the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as third generation cephalosporins. The second anti-amoebic agent required specifically for intraluminal eradication of entamoebic cysts and therefore holistic treatment of amoebiasis is the aminoglycoside paromomycin, an FDA pregnancy category C drug. Paromomycin should not be given in pregnancy with concurrent severe (amoebic) colitis, because inflammation of the colonic mucosa could cause breakdown of the intestinal barrier and subsequent risk for systemic side effects. Paromomycin derives its systemic side-effect profile from its aminoglycosidic origin analogous to its systemically employed pharmacological siblings gentamicin and amikacin. Gentamicin is known for its oto- and nephrotoxic side effects and characterized as a pregnancy category D drug by the FDA. Evidence indicates the possibility of these complications in the fetus, however, placental concentrations in the treatment of chorioamnionitis for example have been shown to be significantly lower than those in maternal blood, mediated by accelerated kidney function in pregnant patients. Paromomycin is essential for intraluminal eradication of E. histolytica and there is no evidence supporting fetotoxicity. We considered a holistic treatment indispensable in our setting to prevent re-infection and further endangerment of the growing fetus. After consultation with gynecology, tropical medicine and clinical pharmacology, and after endoscopy confirmed the absence of mucosal damage, paromomycin was given. Eleven months after discharge, both patient and her newborn child remain well, with no evidence of any treatment-related side-effects.

Methods

All the subjects satisfying the inclusion criteria were carefully worked up in terms of a detailed history and clinical examination. Lab and imaging investigations included complete hemogram; liver function tests; prothrombin time; international normalized ratio; activated partial thromboplastin time; blood culture; amebic serology; imaging-CXR; abdominal USG with or without CT scan of the abdomen; and other investigations as per specific indications in different patients.

An informed consent was obtained from the participating patients and all the consenting patients were started on medical treatment as per our protocol.

All the patients empirically received injection Metronidazole 750 mg IV every t.i.d. injection Cefazolin 1 g IV b.i.d. injection Gentamicin 80 mg IV b.i.d. and chloroquine 600 mg for 2 days (600 mg is total dose for a day which is given in 2 divided doses and not 600 mg q.i.d.) followed by 300 mg for 19 days (given in 2 divided doses). The empirical treatment was revised based on the culture and sensitivity report. However, patients in whom pus culture was sterile continued on the same treatment. The antibiotics and metronidazole were given for duration of 10 and 14 days respectively.

Randomization was done using computer software, according to a standardized previously reported protocol. The two sets of random numbers generated were assigned to the two intervention groups and sealed numbered envelopes were made with the serial number mentioned on the outside and intervention mentioned inside by a non-participating individual. Once a participating subject gave valid consent the pre-determined intervention was carried out as follows: The percutaneous procedures were carried out under local anesthesia (2% lignocaine) with IV analgesia and sedation if required. The procedures were carried out under continuous real-time USG guidance using Philips HD11 ultrasound machine.

PNA

The patient was subjected to USG of the abdomen and the characteristics of the abscess cavity(ies) were recorded. Local anesthesia was infiltrated at the proposed puncture site using a 23 G needle. Under real-time USG guidance and using 18 G BD spinal needle (Becton Dickinson S. A. s. Agustin del Guadalix Madrid, Spain) the abscess cavity was entered and pus was aspirated till no more pus could be aspirated further. A sample of pus was sent for Gram stain, culture, sensitivity and wet mount for Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. A dressing was applied at the needle puncture site.

### Metronidazole (Flagyl) [^111KUQWJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amebiasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess.

In amebic liver abscess, FLAGYL 375 capsules therapy does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with FLAGYL therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to FLAGYL 375 capsules.

INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus), Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, or Peptostreptococcus species.

SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, or Fusobacterium species.

GYNECOLOGIC INFECTIONS, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, or Fusobacterium species.

### Metronidazole [^117JupCj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis

In the Female:

One-day treatment − two grams of metronidazole tablets, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given in the same day.

Seven-day course of treatment − 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 500 mg or 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approx. 500 mg for a 70-kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

SEVERE AMEBIC COLITIS

Amebiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, infects millions of people worldwide, with multiple areas around the world continuing to observe prevalence rates exceeding 10%. Transmission occurs via ingestion of infective cysts, most commonly by fecally contaminated food or water; however, sexual transmission is increasingly recognized. Following transformation within the gut, the trophozoite stage can invade the intestinal mucosa, leading to inflammatory amebic colitis or disseminate with particular predilection to forming amebic liver abscesses. The highest burden is among those residing in developing countries, although changing patterns in immigration, travel, and sexual transmission are leading to re-emergence of amebiasis in developed settings. – Most cases are asymptomatic with approximately 10% of those infected developing amebic colitis, characterized by diarrhea which may be bloody. Severe forms of amebic colitis, though less common, are associated with high mortality. Colonic involvement may progress to bowel necrosis, perforation, peritonitis, shock, and toxic megacolon. Corticosteroid use, even brief exposure, is a known risk factor for the development of severe amebic colitis, occurring even in initially asymptomatic patients. – Patients with diarrhea from amebic colitis are often misdiagnosed as having inflammatory bowel disease and inappropriately treated with steroids, prompting deterioration. Microscopy, which lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity, is unable to distinguish pathogenic and nonpathogenic amebae, so alternative methods should be used for diagnosis whenever possible. A combination of serology, stool antigen, and/or molecular tests often help establish diagnosis, although serology is more difficult to interpret in endemic settings because it may indicate either past or active infection, and antigen tests may be of low sensitivity, particularly for cyst-containing stool and asymptomatic infection. Stool PCR is highly sensitive but use is limited in resource-poor settings. Those with symptoms should be treated with an amebicidal agent, such as metronidazole, followed by a luminal agent, such as paromomycin. Asymptomatic patients only need to be treated with a luminal agent to prevent future development of colitis and spread to uninfected persons.
