## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to evaluate the polynomial (f(x) = x^4 - \\frac{3}{4}x^2 - \\frac{1}{8}x + 1) at (x = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a trigonometric identity that simplifies powers of cosine at this specific angle. Then, I should verify if the polynomial can be factored in a way that exploits known cosine values or minimal polynomials. Next, I will consider substituting (x = \\cos\\theta) and using multiple-angle formulas to reduce the degree. Finally, I will compute the exact value and double-check it numerically to ensure correctness.

> Let me first confirm the angle and its significance. (\\frac{\\pi}{7}) is not one of the standard angles with simple exact cosine values, so I should not expect a trivial simplification like (\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}). However, seventh roots of unity and Chebyshev polynomials can relate (\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}) to algebraic numbers, which might help simplify the polynomial expression.

> Wait, let me verify a potential identity. I initially thought (\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}) might satisfy a simple quadratic, but that is not correct; the minimal polynomial for (2\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}) is cubic, so any simplification will likely involve a cubic relation rather than a quadratic one. I should correct that assumption and proceed with a degree-3 minimal polynomial approach.

> I will now examine the polynomial substitution strategy. Let (x = \\cos\\theta) with (\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{7}), and express (f(x)) in terms of multiple angles using Chebyshev identities. Specifically, (\\cos 2\\theta = 2\\cos^2\\theta - 1) and (\\cos 3\\theta = 4\\cos^3\\theta - 3\\cos\\theta), which allow me to rewrite (x^2) and (x^4) in terms of (\\cos 2\\theta) and (\\cos 4\\theta).

> Let me compute the even powers first. (x^2 = \\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}), and (x^4 = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 + 2\\cos 2\\theta + \\cos^2 2\\theta}{4}). I should double-check that expansion: yes, that is correct, and I can further simplify (\\cos^2 2\\theta) to (\\frac{1 + \\cos 4\\theta}{2}) to get (x^4 = \\frac{3 + 4\\cos 2\\theta + \\cos 4\\theta}{8}).

> Next, I should substitute these into (f(x)) and collect terms. Substituting gives (f(x) = \\frac{3 + 4\\cos 2\\theta + \\cos 4\\theta}{8} - \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}\\cos\\theta + 1). Let me simplify step-by-step: the second term becomes (-\\frac{3}{8}(1 + \\cos 2\\theta)), so combining constants and like terms yields (f(x) = \\frac{3 + 4\\cos 2\\theta + \\cos 4\\theta - 3–3\\cos 2\\theta}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}\\cos\\theta + 1 = \\frac{\\cos 2\\theta + \\cos 4\\theta}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}\\cos\\theta + 1).

> Hold on, I should verify the trigonometric sum-to-product step. The expression (\\cos 2\\theta + \\cos 4\\theta) can be written as (2\\cos 3\\theta \\cos\\theta), so (f(x) = \\frac{2\\cos 3\\theta \\cos\\theta}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}\\cos\\theta + 1 = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{8}(2\\cos 3\\theta - 1) + 1). This looks promising because (\\cos 3\\theta) at (\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{7}) is (\\cos\\frac{3\\pi}{7}), and I can relate that to (\\cos\\frac{4\\pi}{7}) using supplementary angles.

> Let me consider the key identity. Since (\\frac{3\\pi}{7} + \\frac{4\\pi}{7} = \\pi), we have (\\cos\\frac{3\\pi}{7} = -\\cos\\frac{4\\pi}{7}). But wait, I should double-check the sign: yes, (\\cos(\\pi - \\alpha) = -\\cos\\alpha), so (\\cos\\frac{3\\pi}{7} = -\\cos\\frac{4\\pi}{7}). Therefore, (2\\cos 3\\theta - 1 = -2\\cos 4\\theta - 1), which does not immediately simplify to zero. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost claimed it vanishes, but that is not correct; I need to correct that line of thought.

> Let me reconsider the minimal polynomial approach. The value (2\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}) is a root of the cubic (t^3 - t^2–2t + 1 = 0), which implies (8x^3–4x^2–4x + 1 = 0) for (x = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}). I should confirm that relation: yes, that is the correct minimal polynomial for (2\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}), so (8x^3 = 4x^2 + 4x - 1) when (x = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}).

> Now, I will use polynomial division or substitution to reduce (f(x)) modulo the minimal polynomial. Let me first compute (x^4) in terms of lower powers: (x^4 = x \\cdot x^3 = x \\cdot \\frac{4x^2 + 4x - 1}{8} = \\frac{4x^3 + 4x^2 - x}{8}). Substitute (x^3) again to get (x^4 = \\frac{4(\\frac{4x^2 + 4x - 1}{8}) + 4x^2 - x}{8} = \\frac{2x^2 + 2x - \\frac{1}{2} + 4x^2 - x}{8} = \\frac{6x^2 + x - \\frac{1}{2}}{8} = \\frac{12x^2 + 2x - 1}{16}).

> Next, I should substitute this into (f(x)) and simplify. (f(x) = \\frac{12x^2 + 2x - 1}{16} - \\frac{3}{4}x^2 - \\frac{1}{8}x + 1 = \\frac{12x^2 + 2x - 1–12x^2–2x + 16}{16} = \\frac{15}{16}). Wait, let me verify the arithmetic: the (x^2) terms cancel, the (x) terms cancel, and (-1 + 16 = 15), so yes, (f\\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) = \\frac{15}{16}).

> I should double-check this result numerically to ensure there was no algebraic slip. Let (x \\approx \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7} \\approx 0.9009689). Then (x^4 \\approx 0.6585), (-\\frac{3}{4}x^2 \\approx -0.6088), (-\\frac{1}{8}x \\approx -0.1126), and adding 1 gives approximately (0.6585–0.6088–0.1126 + 1 \\approx 0.9371), which is very close to (\\frac{15}{16} = 0.9375). The small difference is due to rounding, so the exact answer is consistent with the numerical check.

> Final answer: (f\\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) = \\frac{15}{16}).

---

The exact value of (f\\left(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)) is (\\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{16}}).

---

To compute (f\\left(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)), we use the identity (\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\omega + \\omega^{-1} \\right)), where (\\omega = e^{i\\pi/7}) is a primitive 14th root of unity. Substituting this into (f(x)) and simplifying using properties of roots of unity yields the result.

---

Let (x = \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7}). Then:

[
f(x) = x^4 - \\frac{3}{4}x^2 - \\frac{1}{8}x + 1
]

Using (x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\omega + \\omega^{-1} \\right)), we compute:

[
x^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\omega^2 + 2 + \\omega^{-2} \\right)
]

[
x^4 = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\omega^4 + 4\\omega^2 + 6 + 4\\omega^{-2} + \\omega^{-4} \\right)
]

Substitute these into (f(x)):

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\omega^4 + 4\\omega^2 + 6 + 4\\omega^{-2} + \\omega^{-4} \\right) - \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\omega^2 + 2 + \\omega^{-2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\omega + \\omega^{-1} \\right) + 1
]

Simplify:

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\omega^4 + 4\\omega^2 + 6 + 4\\omega^{-2} + \\omega^{-4} \\right) - \\frac{3}{16} \\left(\\omega^2 + 2 + \\omega^{-2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\omega + \\omega^{-1} \\right) + 1
]

Combine like terms:

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\omega^4 + \\omega^4 + 4\\omega^2–3\\omega^2 + 4\\omega^{-2} - 3\\omega^{-2} + 6–6 - \\omega - \\omega^{-1} \\right) + 1
]

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(\\omega^4 + \\omega^{-4} + \\omega^2 + \\omega^{-2} - \\omega - \\omega^{-1} \\right) + 1
]

Recognize that (\\omega^k + \\omega^{-k} = 2 \\cos \\frac{k\\pi}{7}):

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{16} \\left(2 \\cos \\frac{4\\pi}{7} + 2 \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{7} - 2 \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7} \\right) + 1
]

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{8} \\left(\\cos \\frac{4\\pi}{7} + \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{7} - \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7} \\right) + 1
]

Using the identity (\\cos \\frac{4\\pi}{7} + \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{7} - \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{7} = -\\frac{1}{2}):

[
f(x) = \\frac{1}{8} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\right) + 1 = -\\frac{1}{16} + 1 = \\frac{15}{16}
]

---

Thus, the exact value is (\\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{16}}).

Calculation of the FRC

Calculation of the FRC can be conveniently performed using the typical fractions, as defined above, rather than through integration of Eq. 4. Precisely, to calculate the FRC for the dose, x i, consider doses x 1,…, x i in isolation from higher doses. Then, the sum of typical fractions v 11,…, v ii is equivalent to FRC for the dose x i The equivalency of the above equation and Eq. 4 is derived in the Supplementary Methods.

Methods

Software implementation

The methodology to perform and visualize FRA is provided as a user-friendly R-package available for download at. The package contains an installation guide and a brief user manual.

Formal definition of the FRC

Consider a series of doses x 1,…, x i,…, x m and denote a single-cell response as y. Depending on the context, y, may be a number or a vector, e.g. the level of one or more measured signaling effectors. Suppose that responses to a given dose, x i, are represented as the probability distribution, The FRC is then formally defined aswhere integration takes place over, the set of all possible responses, y. The integral quantifies the area under the curve (or under surface for multivariate data), with respect to y, defined asFor the calculations shown in Fig. 2 the integration corresponds to the calculation of the area of the gray regions in c–e. As explained in Supplementary Note 1, the FRC defined as above is closely related Rényi min-information capacity.

Formal definition of typical fractions

Having the responses represented in terms of the probability distribution, Eq. 3, we can define which responses, y, are typical to any of the doses. Precisely, we define the response, y, to be typical for dose x j if it is most likely to arise for this dose, which writes asThe above condition allows assigning any response, y, to a dose for which it is typical. Therefore, for a given dose, x i, we can identify what fraction of cells stimulated with this dose exhibits responses typical to any dose, x j, for j from 1 to m. These fractions, denoted as v ij, can be practically computed as explained below.

### Power of data in quantum machine learning [^b2a9dd1b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Ultimately, to see a prediction advantage in a particular dataset with specific function values/labels, we need a large separation between s C and s Q. This happens when the inputs x i, x j considered close in a quantum ML model are actually close in the target function f (x), but are far in classical ML. This is represented as the final test in Fig. 1 and the methodology here outlines how this result can be achieved in terms of its more essential components.

Projected quantum kernels

In addition to analyzing existing quantum models, the analysis approach introduced also provides suggestions for new quantum models with improved properties, which we now address here. For example, if we start with the original quantum kernel, when the effective dimension d is large, kernel Tr(ρ (x i) ρ (x j)), which is based on a fidelity-type metric, will regard all data to be far from each other and the kernel matrix K Q will be close to identity. This results in a small geometric difference g CQ leading to classical ML models being competitive or outperforming the quantum kernel method. In Supplementary Section 9, we present a simple quantum model that requires an exponential amount of samples to learn using the quantum kernel Tr(ρ (x i) ρ (x j)), but only needs a linear number of samples to learn using a classical ML model.

Stochastic processes and minimal-memory classical modelling

A discrete-time stochastic processconsists of a sequence of random variables X t, corresponding to events drawn from a set, and indexed by a timestep. The process is defined by a joint distribution of these random variables across all timesteps, whererepresents the contiguous (across timesteps) series of events between timesteps t 1 and t 2. We consider stochastic processes that are bi-infinite, such thatand, and stationary (time-invariant), such that P (X 0: L) = P (X t: t + L) ∀ t, L ∈. Without loss of generality, we can take the present to be t = 0, such that the past is given by, and the future. Note that we use upper case for random variables and lower case for the corresponding variates.

A (causal) model of such a (bi-infinite and stationary) discrete-time stochastic process consists of an encoding functionthat maps from the set of possible past observationsto a set of memory states –. The model also requires an update rulethat produces the outputs and updates the memory state accordingly. We then designate the memory cost D f of the encoding as the logarithm of the dimension (i.e. the number of (qu)bits) of the smallest system into which these memory states can be embedded. For classical (i.e. mutually orthogonal) memory states, this corresponds to. For quantum memory states, which may, in general, be linearly dependent.

Let us, for now, restrict our attention to statistically-exact models, such that (f, Λ) must produce outputs with a distribution that is identical to the stochastic process being modelled. Under such a condition, the provably-memory minimal classical model of any given discrete-time stochastic process is known and can be systematically constructed. These models are referred to as the ε - machine of the process, which employs an encoding function f ε based on the causal states of the process. This encoding function satisfiesand given initial memory state, the evolution produces output x 0 with probabilityand updates the memory to state. The memory states are referred to as the causal states of the process, and the associated cost D μ is given by the logarithm of the number of causal states.

### Identifying domains of applicability of machine learning models for materials science [^9c5f816f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A predictive ML model is then a functionaiming to minimize the expected error (also called prediction risk)measured by some non-negative loss function l that quantifies the cost incurred by predicting the actual property value y with f (x). Examples for loss functions are the squared error, the absolute error, and, for non-zero properties, the relative error. Here P denotes some fixed probability distribution that captures how candidate materials are assumed to be sampled from the materials class (this concept, while commonly assumed in ML, is an unnecessary restriction for high-throughput screening as we discuss in more detail below). Since the true prediction risk is impossible to compute directly without perfect knowledge of the investigated materials class, models are evaluated by the test error (or empirical risk)defined as the average of the individual errors (losses) e i (f) = l (f (x i), y i) on some test set of m reference data points. The samples in this test set are drawn independently and identically distributed according to P and are also independent of the model — which means in practice that it is a random subset of all available reference data that has been withheld from the ML algorithm. In order to reduce the variance of this estimate, a common strategy is cross-validation, where this process is repeated multiple times based on partitioning the data into a number of non-overlapping "folds" and then to use each of these folds as test sets and the remaining data as a training set to fit the model.

This test error properly estimates the model performance globally over the whole representation space X (weighted by the distribution P used to generate the test points). This is an appropriate evaluation metric for selecting a model that is required to work well on average for arbitrary new input materials that are sampled according to the same distribution P. This is, however, not the condition of high-throughput screening. Here, rather than being presented with random inputs, we can decide which candidate materials to screen next. This observation leads to the central idea enabled by the DA analysis proposed in this work: if the employed model is particularly applicable in a specific subdomain of the materials class, and if that subdomain has a simple and interpretable shape that permits to generate new materials from it, then we can directly focus the screening there.

### Estimating the success of re-identifications in incomplete datasets using generative models [^9c6329d0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Theoretical and empirical population uniqueness

For n individuals x (1), x (2),…, x (n) drawn from X, the uniqueness Ξ X is the expected percentage of unique individuals. It can be estimated either (i) by computing the mean of individual uniqueness or (ii) by sampling a synthetic population of n individuals from the copula distribution. In the former case, we havewhere T x = [∃! i, x (i) = x] equals one if there exists a single individual i such as x (i) = x and zero otherwise. T x follows a binomial distribution B (p (x), n). Thereforeand

This requires iterating over all combinations of attributes, whose number grows exponentially as the number of attributes increases, and quickly becomes computationally intractable. The second method is therefore often more tractable and we use it to estimate population uniqueness in the paper.

For cumulative marginal distributions F 1, F 2,…, F d and copula correlation matrix Σ, the algorithm 1 (Supplementary Methods) samples n individuals from q (⋅|Σ,Ψ) using the latent copula distribution. From the n generated records (y (1), y (2),…, y (n)), we compute the empirical uniqueness

Individual likelihood of uniqueness and correctness

The probability distributioncan be computed by integrating over the latent copula density. Note that the marginal distributions X 1 to X d are discrete, causing the inversestoto have plateaus. When estimating p (x), we integrate over the latent copula distribution inside the hypercube:with ϕ Σ the density of a zero-mean multivariate normal (MVN) of correlation matrix Σ. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate MVN rectangle probabilities. Genz and Bretz, proposed a randomized quasi Monte Carlo method which we use to estimate the discrete copula density.

The likelihood ξ x for an individual's record x to be unique in a population of n individuals can be derived from p X (X = x):

Similarly, the likelihoodfor an individual's record x to be correctly matched in a population of n individuals can be derived from. With, the number of potential false positives in the population, we have:

Note that, since records are independent, T follows a binomial distribution B (n − 1, p (x)).

We substitute the expression for ξ x in the last formula and obtain:

### Power of data in quantum machine learning [^03099894]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Given some set of data, if s K (N) is found to be small relative to N after training for a classical ML model, this quantum model f (x) can be predicted accurately even if f (x) is hard to compute classically for any given x. In order to formally evaluate the potential for quantum prediction advantage generally, one must take s K (N) to be the minimal over efficient classical models. However, we will be more focused on minimally attainable values over a reasonable set of classical methods with tuned hyperparameters. This prescribes an effective method for evaluating potential quantum advantage in practice, and already rules out a considerable number of examples from the literature.

From the bound, we can see that the potential advantage for one ML algorithm defined by K 1 to predict better than another ML algorithm defined by K 2 depends on the largest possible separation betweenandfor a dataset. The separation can be characterized by defining an asymmetric geometric difference that depends on the dataset, but is independent of the function values or labels. Hence evaluating this quantity is a good first step in understanding if there is a potential for quantum advantage, as shown in Fig. 1. This quantity is defined bywhere ∣∣. ∣∣ ∞ is the spectral norm of the resulting matrix and we assume Tr(K 1) = Tr(K 2) = N. One can show that, which implies the prediction error bound. A detailed derivation is given in Supplementary Section C and an illustration of g 12 can be found in Fig. 2. The geometric difference g (K 1 ∣∣ K 2) can be computed on a classical computer by performing a singular value decomposition of the N × N matrices K 1 and K 2. Standard numerical analysis packagesprovide highly efficient computation of a singular value decomposition in time at most order N 3. Intuitively, if K 1 (x i, x j) is small/large when K 2 (x i, x j) is small/large, then the geometric difference g 12 is a small value ~1, where g 12 grows as the kernels deviate.

### The X factor: a robust and powerful approach to X-chromosome-inclusive whole-genome association studies [^df818ada]. Genetic Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The X-chromosome is often excluded from genome-wide association studies because of analytical challenges. Some of the problems, such as the random, skewed, or no X-inactivation model uncertainty, have been investigated. Other considerations have received little to no attention, such as the value in considering nonadditive and gene-sex interaction effects, and the inferential consequence of choosing different baseline alleles (i.e., the reference vs. the alternative allele). Here we propose a unified and flexible regression-based association test for X-chromosomal variants. We provide theoretical justifications for its robustness in the presence of various model uncertainties, as well as for its improved power when compared with the existing approaches under certain scenarios. For completeness, we also revisit the autosomes and show that the proposed framework leads to a more robust approach than the standard method. Finally, we provide supporting evidence by revisiting several published association studies. Supporting Information for this article are available online.

### A systematic review of quantum machine learning for digital health [^82729dc6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the circuit visualization of Fig. 1, inputs to a quantum algorithm are qubit states denoted with ket-notationand boxed operations denote quantum gates. These gates are associated with reversible, logical operations performed on quantum states. The circuit is terminated with measurements of a quantum state which yield probabilistic outcomes, '0' or '1', where probabilities are determined by the quantum circuit. Suppose for some input quantum state, ρ 0, the average output of a quantum computation is given by f (x, θ) where (x, θ) define classical inputs to a quantum algorithm. Here, ρ 0 represents an input state, such as all qubits in their ground (zero) state; x represents one sample of real data with dimension d, for a dataset with N samples, and tunable free parameters, θ, that parameterize the circuit. One encodes data x into quantum states using a parameterized quantum gate, denoted U (x). Meanwhile, free parameters, θ, implement classically optimized or trained quantum gates, V (θ). With these assumptions, the desired output information required from the circuit is typically given with reference to an observable quantity. This output information is inherently statistical, i.e. one must infer average information aboutfrom a statistical ensemble of '0' or '1' measurements obtained by repeatedly preparing and measuring the same quantum circuit N s number of times. Therefore to extract information about, we build up an ensemble of quantum measurements by repeatedly running a quantum circuit N s number of times for a single instance of x, and repeating for different choices of x.

An illustrative example

Before describing the details of DA identification and its integration into the ML process, let us illustrate the concept and its utility via a synthetic example (see Fig. 1). We consider a simple two-dimensional representation consisting of independent features x 1 and x 2 that are each distributed according to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 (N (0, 2)) and a target property y that is a third-degree polynomial in x 1 with an additive noise component that scales exponentially in x 2 :That is, the y values are almost determined by the third-degree polynomial for low x 2 values but are almost completely random for high x 2 values. Discovering applicable domains reveals how different models cope differently with this setting even if they have a comparable average error. To show this, let us examine the error distributions obtained from three different kernelized regression models of the formwith parameter vector ν that are fitted around a training, or fitting (F), setwith three different choices for the kernel function k. We observe:
When using the linear (lin) kernel, the resulting linear model is globally incapable to trace the variation of the third-order polynomial except for a small stripe on the x 1 -axis where it can be approximated well by a linear function. Consequently, there is a very high error globally that is substantially reduced in the DA described by σ lin (x 1, x 2) ≡ −0.3 ≤ x 1 ≤ 0.3.
When using the Gaussian kernel), the resulting radial basis function (rbf) model is able to represent the target property well locally unless (a) the noise component is too large and (b) the variation of the target property is too high relative to the number of training points. The second restriction is because the rbfs have non-negligible values only within a small region around the training examples. Consequently, the discovered DA is not only restricted in x 2 -direction but also excludes high absolute x 1 -values: σ rbf ≡ −3.3 ≤ x 11 ≤ 3.1 ∧ x 2 ≤ 0.1.
In contrast, when using the non-local third-degree polynomial (poly) kernel, data sparsity does not prevent an accurate modeling of the target property along the x 1 -axis. However, this non-locality is counterproductive along the x 2 -axis where overfitting of the noise component has a global influence that results in higher prediction errors for the almost deterministic data points with low x 2 -values. This is reflected in the identified DA σ poly (x 1, x 2) ≡ −3.5 ≤ x 2 ≤ 0.1, which contains no restriction in x 1 -direction, but excludes both high and low x 2 -values. This highlights an important structural difference between the rbf and the polynomial model that is not reflected in their similar average errors.

The measurements are made at the same scanning speed U = 100 nm/s, and under the same normal load N = 500 nN, for both the quasi-1D probe (black circles) and 2D probe (red triangles).

Under the mean-field approximation, the stick-slip motion of the scanning probe may be envisioned as a result of its center-of-mass (at position x s) moving in a random pinning force field F i (x s) in Eq. (4) under the influence of F e (x 0; x s), where x 0 = U t. The equation of motion of x s (t) can be written aswhere m and γ are, respectively, the effective mass and damping coefficient of the scanning probe, and F i (x s) > 0 is a random pinning force field. Equation (6) is an extension of the PT model, which laid down the foundation for our understanding of stick-slip instabilities. In the original PT model. the external pinning (or frictional) force field F i (x s) was assumed to be of a sinusoidal form for a single crystalline surface. For many rough surfaces of practical interest, however, F i (x s) > 0 is a random force field. Because disorder has many different forms, modeling a realistic random force field that can be compared directly with the experimental results remains a challenging task. Here we show that because the asperity-induced frictional force acting on a mesoscale scanning probe is a running average of the individual pinning forces resulting from a finite number of asperities at the interface, the resulting force field F i (x s) is Brownian correlated, i.e. where D is a measure of the fluctuation amplitude of F i (x s) (see SI Section III.B for more details). The Brownian correlation is a general feature of the random pinning force field and has been used in the Alessandro–Beatrice–Bertotti–Montorsi (ABBM) model, to describe the avalanche dynamics of domain walls in soft magnets.

Point A corresponds to the canonical example of spurious r(X,Δ), introduced in the last section: i.e. σ Y /σ X ≈ 1 and r(X, Y) ≈ 0, but r(X,Δ) ≈ −0.71 (Fig. 3 A). At Point B, σ Y /σ X ≈ 1 and r(X, Y) is strong, so recovery is approximately constant (Fig. 3 B) and r(X,Δ) ≈ 0, consistent with the view that strong r(X, Y) curtail spurious r(X,Δ). However, the situation is more complex when σ Y /σ X is more skewed.

When σ Y /σ X is large, Y contributes more variance to Y − X (Δ), and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X, Y); this is Regime 1. Points C and D illustrate the convergence (Fig. 3 C and D). By contrast, when σ Y /σ X is small, X contributes more variance to Y − X, and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X, −X): i.e. −1 (Supplementary material, Appendix A, theorem 2); this is Regime 2, where the confound emerges. Point E, near Regime 2, corresponds to data in which all patients recover proportionally (Δ = 70% of lost function; Fig. 2 E). Here, σ Y /σ X is already small enough (0.3) to be dangerous: after randomly shuffling Y, r(X, Y) ≈ 0, but r(X,Δ) is almost unaffected (Point F, and Fig. 3 F). In other words, if even the proportional recovery rule is approximately right, empirical data may enter territory, on the surface in Fig. 2, where over-optimistic r(X,Δ) are likely.

### Epidemic modelling suggests that in specific circumstances masks may become more effective when fewer contacts wear them [^c8fa1656]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Parameters

Unless stated otherwise, the following parameter settings were used. Simulations were performed for N = 10 5 nodes and averaged over 20 independent iterations. The parameters were chosen such that k = 20, α = 0.02, γ = 0.1, q = 0.99, q r (0) = q s (0) = 1, η = 1, and ϵ = 0.1. For the initial condition we randomly choose ten nodes and set their X i (t = 0) = I; for all the others we set X i (t = 0) = S. The model halts once the outbreak has ended, i.e. X i (t) ≠ I for all i.

### State-level tracking of COVID-19 in the United States [^3372339c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Model specifics

The true number of infected individuals, i, is modelled using a discrete renewal process. We specify a generation distribution g with density g (τ) as:Given the generation distribution, the number of infections i t, m on a given day t, and state m, is given by the following discrete convolution function:where the generation distribution is discretised byfor s = 2, 3. and. The population of state m is denoted by N m. We include the adjustment factor S t, m to account for the number of susceptible individuals left in the population.

Both deaths and cases are observed in our model. We define daily deaths, D t, m, for days t ∈ {1,…, n } and states m ∈ {1,…, M }. These daily deaths are modelled using a positive real-valued functionthat represents the expected number of deaths attributed to COVID-19. The daily deaths D t, m are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with mean d t, m and variance, where ψ 1 follows a positive half normal distribution, i.e. Here, denotes a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. We say that X follows a positive half normal distributionif X ~ ∣ Y ∣, where.

We link our observed deaths mechanistically to transmission as in Flaxman et al. We use a previously estimated COVID-19 infection fatality ratio (IFR, probability of death given infection) together with a distribution of times from infection to death π. Details of this calculation can be found in. From the above, every region has a specific mean infection fatality ratio i f r m (see Supplementary Note 13). To incorporate the uncertainty inherent in this estimate we allow the i f r m for every state to have additional noise around the mean. Specifically we assumeWe believe a large-scale contact survey similar to polymodhas not been collated for the USA, so we assume the contact patterns are similar to those in the UK. We conducted a sensitivity analysis, shown in Supplementary Note 13, and found that the IFR calculated using the contact matrices of other European countries lay within the posterior of.

### Spin dephasing under nonlinear gradients: implications for imaging and field mapping [^eaf2803c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This work examines the prototypical MR echo that would be expected for a voxel of spins evolving in a strong nonlinear field, specifically focusing on the quadratic z(2) - ½(x(2) + y(2)) field. Dephasing under nonlinear gradients is increasingly relevant given the growing interest in nonlinear imaging, and here, we report several notable differences from the linear case. Most notably, in addition to signal loss, intravoxel dephasing under gradients creating a wide and asymmetric frequency distribution across the voxel can cause skewed and nonlinear phase evolution. After presenting the qualitative and analytical origins of this difference, we experimentally demonstrate that neglecting these dynamics can lead to significant errors in sequences that assume phase evolution is proportional to voxel frequency, such as those used for field mapping. Finally, simplifying approximations to the signal equations are presented, which not only provide more intuitive forms of the exact expression but also result in simple rules to predict key features of the nonlinear evolution.

### Testing predictions of a neural process model of visual attention in infancy across competitive and non-competitive contexts [^34dee195]. Infancy (2022). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Reaction times to shift to the peripheral target

The top panels of Figure 4 show the reaction time results. The most apparent finding is the striking difference in reaction times between the non‐competitive and competitive conditions, with RTs drastically slowed during the competitive trials. A mixed‐design ANOVA confirmed this observation, revealing a significant main effect of competition, F (1,78) = 196.618, p < .001, = .716, which was qualified by a significant age by competition interaction, F (2,78) = 3.643, p = .031, = .085. As can be seen in Figure 5, older infants showed faster reaction times than 5‐month‐olds in the non‐competitive conditions, but slower reaction times than 5‐month‐olds in the competitive conditions.

### Development of a core outcome set for lateral elbow tendinopathy (COS-LET) using best available evidence and an international consensus process [^621fa135]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The PRTEE should be used in all future studies related to LET — especially for the disability domain. Time off work, pain-free grip strength and a Numerical Rating Scale measuring pain on gripping should also be used until future studies recommend alternative, more robust, measures of participation in life activities, physical function capacity and pain on activity/loading. A COS-LET Tool, containing these recommended measures, has been composed (see online supplemental file 4). Further work is required to (a) validate the interim measures for use in research involving persons with LET and (b) develop/validate suitable measures of the patient rating of condition, quality of life and psychological factors domains.

### X chromosome-inactivation patterns of 1, 005 phenotypically unaffected females [^2d21444c]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

X-chromosome inactivation is widely believed to be random in early female development and to result in a mosaic distribution of cells, approximately half with the paternally derived X chromosome inactive and half with the maternally derived X chromosome inactive. Significant departures from such a random pattern are hallmarks of a variety of clinical states, including being carriers for severe X-linked diseases or X-chromosome cytogenetic abnormalities. To evaluate the significance of skewed patterns of X inactivation, we examined patterns of X inactivation in a population of > 1,000 phenotypically unaffected females. The data demonstrate that only a very small proportion of unaffected females show significantly skewed inactivation, especially during the neonatal period. By comparison with this data set, the degree of skewed inactivation in a given individual can now be quantified and evaluated for its potential clinical significance.

### Development of a core outcome set for lateral elbow tendinopathy (COS-LET) using best available evidence and an international consensus process [^69a2fd81]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pain-free grip strength was recommended as an interim measure for physical function capacity domain, but it was not included in the final COS-LET due to limited validation in LET populations. With clear stakeholder approval, further validation work should be prioritised.

Measuring the pain on activity/loading domain was the source of a lengthy discussion, because the two options with sufficient psychometric evidence failed to reach consensus. Discussion then moved to rating pain on gripping as an interim measure. Gripping was raised as a common pain provoking activity in the patient focus groups. It had been voted in survey 1 to be in the COS-LET by patients and clinicians/researchers, but due to a lack of research it was not voted in survey 2. In the meeting, concerns were raised about standardising the gripping task — as this would be difficult across sexes and different work/sport contexts. We resolved to recommend using a Numerical Rating Scale to record pain during gripping in the interim and to prioritise its validation.

### Laser technology: source of coherent kiloelectronvolt X-rays [^cc45c2c9]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Generating X-rays that have the properties of laser light has been a long-standing goal for experimental science. Here we describe the emission of highly collimated, spatially coherent X-rays, at a wavelength of about 1 nanometre and at photon energies extending to 1.3 kiloelectronvolts, from atoms that have been ionized by a 5-femtosecond laser pulse. This means that a laboratory source of laser-like, kiloelectronvolt X-rays, which will operate on timescales relevant to many chemical, biological and materials problems, is now within reach.

### Differential spatial computations in ventral and lateral face-selective regions are scaffolded by structural connections [^5e6b9b8a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To quantify differences in VFC across face-selective regions, we calculated the average pRF density as a function of eccentricity for the contralateral visual field of each ROI. Ventral face-selective regions displayed high pRF density close to the fovea that decreased sharply beyond ~10°, while pRF density in lateral face-selective regions decreased more moderately with increasing eccentricity (Fig. 4B). We summarized the relationship between pRF density and eccentricity by fitting both generalized logistic and linear functions for each participant's pRF density curve per ROI as the ventral regions appear to be best approximated by a logistic function but the lateral face-selective regions by a linear function (see "Methods" section). Irrespective of the model-fitting approach, we find significant differences in the fitted parameters between ventral and lateral face-selective regions. For the linear model, we examined the slope of the line as negative slopes indicate higher pRF density near the fovea than the periphery, and slopes close to 0 indicate similar pRF densities across eccentricities. Results reveal (i) significant differences between the average slopes of ventral and lateral face-selective regions (paired t-tests; right: t (24) = −9.8, p = 7.4 × 10 −10, d = 2.00; left: t (22) = −8.2, p = 3.7 × 10 −8, d = 1.75), whereby slopes for ventral face-selective ROIs were more negative than for lateral face-selective ROIs and (ii) significant differences between the average slopes of individual face-selective ROIs (right: F (4,85) = 47.6, p < 2.2 × 10 −16, η p 2 = 0.69; left: F (4,84) = 26.9, p = 2.3 × 10 −14, η p 2 = 0.56, 1-way repeated measures LMM ANOVAs on the slopes with factor ROI). Specifically, slopes in lateral face-selective regions — pSTS-faces and mSTS-faces — were significantly closer to zero than any of the ventral face-selective regions (all t s > 4.1, p s ≤ .0008, post-hoc Tukey tests, Supplementary Table 3). In addition, bilateral pFus-faces and right mFus-faces had significantly more negative slopes than IOG-faces (all t s < −3.3, p s ≤ .012, Supplementary Table 3), indicating that the former ROIs have a larger foveal bias than the latter. Similarly, the parameters for both the inflection point and the lower asymptote of the fitted logistic function were significantly different between ventral and lateral regions in both hemispheres, such that ventral face-selective regions had smaller valued lower asymptotes (paired t -tests; right: t (24) = −4.6, p = 0.00011, d = .94; left: t (22) = −4.2, p = .00041, d = .89) and inflection points (paired t-tests; right: t (24) = −4.0, p = 0.00055, d = .81; left: t (22) = −2.3, p = 0.034, d = .48) than lateral face-selective regions.

### Development of a core outcome set for lateral elbow tendinopathy (COS-LET) using best available evidence and an international consensus process [^f580e8eb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background and objectives

Pain arising from the tendons on the lateral side of the elbow is common in adults, particularly in middle age. Historically, it has been known by various names such as lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow, but the current accepted description is lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET). It is acknowledged that there is substantial heterogeneity of outcome measure instrument use in elbow research and specifically for LET. With no clear consensus on which instruments most accurately represent a patient's LET-related health status, comparison of effectiveness research and evidence synthesis/meta-analysis has been hampered.

In 2019, an international group of experts in the field of tendinopathy (International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium Consensus (ICON) Group), comprising researchers, healthcare professionals and patients, published a consensus document defining the nine health-related core domains of tendinopathy. That group recommended researchers and clinicians measure outcomes for specific regional tendinopathies against these domains.

The aim of this project was to develop a core outcome set (COS) for LET that maps to the nine domains. A COS is a minimal set of outcome measures to be used in future research and clinical practice involving people with LET. It enables meta-analysis of findings from different studies using a consistent set of measures. To be included in a COS, measures need to be both practical to perform (based on cost, patient burden and availability) and of high quality (valid, responsive, reliable, interpretable and of acceptable burden for patients and investigators). The result will be a minimum set of outcome measurement instruments to be used in future LET research that allows direct comparison between different studies across the nine domains.

Scope

This COS relates to all adults diagnosed with LET and applies to interventional research (including surgical and non-surgical) and longitudinal assessment. The COS will only apply to the English language.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^ee7134ad]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Trap arrays and control potentials

Our surface ion trap chip is fabricated in similar manner to that described in ref.and consists of two equilateral triangular trap arrays with side length of ≃40 and ≃80 μm, respectively (Fig. 1a, b), both with a distance of ≃40 μm between the ions and the nearest electrode surface. The shapes of radio-frequency (RF) electrodes of the arrays are optimized by a linear-programming algorithm that yields electrode shapes with low fragmentation, and requires only a single RF-voltage source for operation. To design different and even non-periodic arrays for dedicated trap distances, we can apply the same algorithm to yield globally optimal electrode shapes. Resulting electrode shapes may look significantly different, but will have comparable complexity, spatial extent and the same number of control electrodes per trap site. Therefore, we expect that different arrays will not require different fabrication techniques (Methods). The two arrays are spaced by ≃5 mm on the chip, and only one of them is operated at a given time. Although we achieve similar results in both arrays, the following discussion is focussed on the 80 μm array.

Three-dimensional confinement of 25 Mg + ions is provided by a potential φ RF oscillating at Ω RF from a single RF electrode driven at Ω RF /(2 π) = 48.3 MHz with an approximate peak voltage U RF = 20 V. Setting the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the array and in the surface plane of the chip, the RF potential features three distinct trap sites at T0 ≃(−46,0,37) μm,… Owing to the electrode symmetry under rotations of ± 2 π /3 around the z -axis, it is often sufficient to consider T0 only, as all our findings apply to T1 and T2 after an appropriate rotation. Further, the RF potential exhibits another trap site at ≃(0,0,81) μm (above the centre of the array); this 'ancillary' trap is used for loading as well as for re-capturing ions that escaped from the other trap sites. We approximate the RF confinement at position r by a pseudopotential, cp. ref. where Q denotes the charge and m the mass of the ion, and E RF (r) is the field amplitude produced by the electrode. Calculations of trapping potentials are based on ref.and utilizing the software package. Equipotential lines of φ ps are shown in Fig. 1c–e.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^8e3b5e57]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The ever-expanding arsenal of treatment regimes for tendinopathy can be overwhelming to the treating healthcare professional. New treatments continuously emerge and so do research studies that aim to assess their effectiveness. The most powerful tool that evidence-based medicine has to offer remains systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which constitute the highest level of evidence and are therefore often used to inform guidelines and guide clinical practice.

Unlike a narrative review, which is purely a summary of a proportion of (or all) the available studies on a given topic without assessing the quality of the included evidence, an SR is expected to include all the relevant evidence which is comprehensively and thoroughly appraised and presented with qualitative or quantitative syntheses and accompanying strengths of evidence. For reliable, clinically relevant conclusions to be reached, the potential limitations of the included studies need to be considered. What determines the 'quality' of a study remains poorly defined but should relate to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis and presentation are appropriate to answer its research question. Generally, study quality assessment includes a combined assessment of its internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalisability/applicability) and precision (freedom from random error)(online supplemental figure 1). The Cochrane group, which produce some of the highest quality SRs, recommend emphasising the internal validity when assessing the quality of a study, reflected by the risk-of-bias assessment (RoB) tool they have produced. However, external validity and precision should not be overlooked.

Assessing the strength of evidence (also known as 'certainty', 'quality', 'level' or 'grade' of evidence) is closely interlinked with RoB assessment and is a process which is commonly overlooked by many SRs. Together with a meticulous methodology and comprehensive RoB assessment, this is what distinguishes a SR from other types of review articles. Assigning a strength of evidence to a finding is as important as the finding itself. Strength of evidence should accompany every assessed outcome measure within an SR for every assessed follow-up time period. A result with a low strength of evidence differs substantially from that with a high level of evidence in terms of its applicability to clinical practice; further research is likely to change the former but not the latter. Equally, the strength of evidence can be high in an outcome measure and low in another, and high for a certain follow-up but period and low for another.

5.1	Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure

Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients treated with ALYFTREK [Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases of serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury and liver failure have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease who were taking a fixed-dose combination drug containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA), which contains the same or similar active ingredients as ALYFTREK. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating ALYFTREK. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing ELX, TEZ and/or IVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt ALYFTREK in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include:

Significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g. ALT or AST > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST > 3× ULN with bilirubin > 2× ULN)
Clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites)

Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume ALYFTREK treatment with close monitoring.

ALYFTREK should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). ALYFTREK is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Probing intermediates of the induction period prior to nucleation and growth of semiconductor quantum dots [^79dbdd79]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

When the Cd and Te precursors were mixed at 130 °C and kept at this temperature, interestingly, fragments of Cd x Te y consisting of Cd and Te isotopic peaks were detected from the 130 °C samples with different reaction times (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs 5−6). Five groups of fragments were observed; the relatively dominant peaks of each of the five groups are labelled with star symbols at m / z 929, 1,041, 1,169, 1,316 and 1,428. From the Cd and Te isotopic patterns and peak positions (Supplementary Fig. 7), we were able to match the experimental mass fragments with calculated weights of Cd x Te y. These five fragments are thus assigned to Cd 6 Te 2, Cd 7 Te 2, Cd 7 Te 3, Cd 6 Te 5 and Cd 7 Te 5, respectively. Closer examination reveals that from left to right, the fragments consisting of Cd x Te y isotopes are attributed to Cd 7 Te 1, Cd 6 Te 2 and Cd 5 Te 3 (Fig. 3b), Cd 8 Te 1, Cd 7 Te 2, and Cd 6 Te 3 (Fig. 3c), Cd 7 Te 3 and Cd 5 Te 5 (Fig. 3d), Cd 7 Te 4, Cd 6 Te 5, and Cd 5 Te 6 (Fig. 3e), and Cd 7 Te 5 and Cd 6 Te 6 (Fig. 3f). These positively charged fragments, which were stripped off from the intermediate by electrospray ionization, have a general formula of Cd x Te y, with x + y = 8 (b), 9 (c), 10 (d), 11 (e) and 12 (f). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be performed in the future to elaborate the probable skeleton of the Cd x Te y fragments. Two candidate skeletons of the Cd 6 Te 2 and Cd 7 Te 2 fragments are suggested in Fig. 3g, h, respectively. With the formation of Cd — Te covalent bonds, Intermediate 2 formed in the 130 °C/30 min sample resulted in the formation of MSC-371 in the OTA and toluene mixture (Supplementary Fig. 4). Again, Intermediate 2 with the formation of Cd — Te covalent bonds is optically invisible in toluene and becomes optically visible in the OTA and toluene mixture via the expression of itself as MSCs.

### Persistent tennis elbow symptoms have little prognostic value: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^47de1d20]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tennis elbow is a common painful enthesopathy of the lateral elbow that limits upper limb function and frequently results in lost time at work. Surgeons often recommend surgery if symptoms persist despite nonsurgical management, but operations for tennis elbow are inconsistent in their efficacy, and what we know about those operations often derives from observational studies that assume the condition does not continue to improve over time. This assumption is largely untested, and it may not be true; meta-analyzing results from the control arms of tennis elbow studies can help us to evaluate this premise, but to our knowledge, this has not been done.

Questions/Purposes

The aims of this systematic review were to describe the course of (1) global improvement, (2) pain, and (3) disability in participants who received no active treatment (placebo or no treatment) in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tennis elbow. We also assessed (4) whether the duration of symptoms or placebo effect is associated with differences in symptom trajectories.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to August 12, 2019, for trials including participants with tennis elbow and a placebo or a no-treatment arm and a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. There were no language restrictions or exclusion criteria. We extracted global improvement, pain, and disability outcomes. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the risk of bias of included trials. To estimate the typical course of tennis elbow without active treatment, we pooled global improvement (the proportion of participants who reported feeling much better or completely recovered), mean pain, and mean disability using baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up data. We transformed pain and disability data from the original papers so that at each timepoint the relevant outcome was expressed as change relative to baseline to account for different baseline values. We used meta-regression to assess whether the placebo effect or duration of symptoms before enrollment was associated with differences in symptom trajectories. We included 24 trials with 1085 participants who received no active treatment.

Results

The number of patients who were not improved decreased exponentially over time. The half-life of global improvement was between 2.5 and 3 months (that is, every 2.5 to 3 months, 50% of the remaining symptomatic patients reported complete recovery or greatly improved symptoms). At 1 year, 89% (189 of 213; 95% CI 80% to 97%) of patients experienced global improvement. The mean pain and disability followed a similar pattern, halving every 3 to 4 months. Eighty-eight percent of pain (95% CI 70% to 100%) and 85% of disability (95% CI 60% to 100%) had resolved by 1 year. The mean duration of symptoms before trial enrollment was not associated with differences in symptom trajectories. The trajectories of the no-treatment and placebo arms were similar, indicating that the placebo effect of the studied active treatments likely is negligible.

Conclusion

Based on the placebo or no-treatment control arms of randomized trials, about 90% of people with untreated tennis elbow achieve symptom resolution at 1 year. The probability of resolution appears to remain constant throughout the first year of follow-up and does not depend on previous symptom duration, undermining the rationale that surgery is appropriate if symptoms persist beyond a certain point of time. We recommend that clinicians inform people who are frustrated with persisting symptoms that this is not a cause for apprehension, given that spontaneous improvement is about as likely during the subsequent few months as it was early after the symptoms first appeared. Because of the high likelihood of spontaneous recovery, any active intervention needs to be justified by high levels of early efficacy and little or no risk to outperform watchful waiting.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

3.3 In vivo brain acquisitions

Selected time‐point images with and without in‐plane motion correction are shown in Supporting Information Figure S5, for 2 subjects (1 and 2). Blurring and ghosting artifacts (in addition to misregistration) are visible when no motion correction is used; conversely, both these effects are minimized with the proposed MC‐MRF approach. T 1, T 2, and M 0 maps are shown for 4 representative subjects in Figures 6 and 7. Results without motion correction have ghosting and blurring artifacts, obscuring several brain structures. Motion correction improves parametric maps to a similar quality of the case without motion. The estimated in‐plane motion amplitudes for rotation, left‐right translation, and anterior‐posterior translation in the format [minimum, average, maximum] were R = [5.6, 11.1, 18.3]°, T x = [5.2, 9.3, 19.4] mm, and T y = [0.4, 1.1, 1.8] mm, respectively. The corresponding estimated amplitudes for the through‐plane experiments were R = [3.1, 9.3 22.1]°, T x = [8.7, 17.1, 32.2] mm, and T y = [0.6, 1.8, 4.4] mm, respectively. Subject 1 had the minimum estimated motion amplitudes, whereas subject 4 had the maximum estimated motion amplitudes. The estimated in‐plane motion plots in Supporting Information Figure S6 capture the continuous cyclical motion performed by the subjects in Figures 6 and 7.

### Sodium fluoride f-18 (sodium fluoride F 18) [^71c0b65f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

11.1 Chemical Characteristics

Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical, containing no-carrier-added, radioactive fluoride F18 that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with PET imaging. It is administered by intravenous injection. The active ingredient, sodium fluoride F18, has the molecular formula Na[18F] with a molecular weight of 40.99, and has the following chemical structure:

Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is provided as a ready-to-use, isotonic, sterile, pyrogen-free, preservative-free, clear and colorless solution. Each mL of the solution contains between 370 MBq and 7,400 MBq (10 mCi to 200 mCi) sodium fluoride F18, at the EOS reference time, in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride. The pH of the solution is between 4.5 and 8. The solution is presented in XX mL multiple- dose glass vials with variable total volume and total radioactivity in each vial.

11.2 Physical Characteristics

Fluoride F18 decays by positron (β+) emission and has a half-life of 109.7 minutes. Ninety-seven percent of the decay results in emission of a positron with a maximum energy of 633 keV and 3% of the decay results in electron capture with subsequent emission of characteristic X-rays of oxygen. The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons, resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron (Table 2). Fluorine F18 atom decays to stable18O-oxygen.

The specific gamma ray constant for fluoride F18 is 5.7 R/hr/mCi (1.35 x 10-6Gy/hr/kBq) at 1 cm. The half-value layer (HVL) for the 511 keV photons is 4.1 mm lead (Pb). A range of values for the attenuation of radiation results from the interposition of various thickness of Pb. The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide is shown in Table 3. For example, the interposition of an 8.3 mm thickness of Pb with a coefficient of attenuation of 0.25 will decrease the external radiation by 75%.

Table 4 lists the fraction of radioactivity remaining at selected time intervals from the calibration time. This information may be used to correct for physical decay of the radionuclide.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^ec006ee8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

### A framework for motion correction of background suppressed arterial spin labeling perfusion images acquired with simultaneous multi-slice EPI [^62b9268e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

From the M 0 images, 7 time series of 60 dynamic images each were generated, and 6 different types of motion (translation in the x‐, y‐, and z‐direction and rotation around the x‐, y‐ and z‐axes) were applied to 6 of them. As illustrated in Figure 2, each type of motion has a 4‐step pattern in a single time series: ± 1.4 and ± 2.8 fractional pixel translation (± 4.2 and ± 8.4 mm) in the x‐ and y‐direction, ± 0.6 and ± 1.2 fractional slice shift (± 4.2 and ± 8.4 mm) in the z‐direction, and ± 3 and ± 6° rotation around the x‐, y‐, and z‐axes. One time series was untouched (no‐motion data set). By using the T 1 map, the pixel‐wise signal attenuation as a result of 2 BGS inversion pulses (TI = 1860 and 3150 ms) was calculated, in which different PLDs for the multi‐slice acquisition were incorporated by assuming an interval of 30 ms between 2 subsequent excitation pulses; SMS acquisition with factor 3 was assumed and the following standard Bloch‐equation was used for calculating the evolution of the longitudinal magnetization

Figure 2
Motion applied to the simulated data set: ± 1.4 and 2.8 fractional pixel translation (± 4.2 and 8.4 mm) in the x‐ and y‐direction, ± 0.6 and 1.2 fractional slice shift (± 4.2 and 8.4 mm) in z‐direction, and ± 3 and 6° rotation around the x‐, y‐, and z‐axes

where M z (t) is the longitudinal magnetization at time point t, M 0 and T 1 are pixel‐wise values from the M 0 image and T 1 map, respectively. Afterward, perfusion‐like signal changes were incorporated to the even dynamic numbers to represent the labeled images. Perfusion‐like signal was only added to the left side of the brain, thereby keeping the right side without perfusion, in which all signal intensity that would appear after the post‐processing will be a measure of the artefactual signal as a result of applied post‐processing without any influence of the underlying perfusion pattern. Using these data sets, 2 studies were carried out.

### Amphetamine (dyanavel XR) [^4d150a5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

DYANAVEL XR contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

DYANAVEL XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. DYANAVEL XR can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including DYANAVEL XR, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

DYANAVEL XR may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including DYANAVEL XR include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

DYANAVEL XR may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### Differential spatial computations in ventral and lateral face-selective regions are scaffolded by structural connections [^f4e422e2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We found direct white matter connections between each face-selective and place-selective region and EVC in all participants where we could localize the region (Fig. 6A, representative subjects; all subjects, Supplementary Fig. 6). Qualitatively, fWMT between face-selective regions and EVC were largely consistent across participants, although the proportion of tracts varied substantially by region (Fig. 6B). IOG-faces had the highest percentage of its tracts connecting to EVC (right: mean ± SE = 37.7 ± 4.2%, left: 39.6 ± 6.4%), followed by pFus-faces (right: 13.2 ± 1.7%, left: 14.7 ± 2.8%). mSTS-faces had the lowest percentage, with less than 3% of all mSTS-faces tracts connecting to EVC (right: 2.0 ± 0.5%; left: 2.3 ± 0.8%). Due to both the low number of left mSTS-faces ROIs and the low percentage of fibers connecting to EVC, we excluded left hemisphere mSTS-faces from subsequent analyses. However, in both hemispheres, ventral mFus-faces and lateral pSTS-faces had similar percentages of tracts to EVC (right mFus-faces: 9.5 ± 1.6%, left mFus-faces: 8.4 ± 0.9%; right pSTS-faces: 10.8 ± 1.7%, left pSTS-faces: 9.0 ± 1.6%), suggesting that differences in fWMT to EVC do not stem from differences in our ability to identify tracts across ventral and lateral streams. In addition, despite their adjacent locations, ventral regions mFus-faces and CoS-places have different percentages of connections to EVC. Specifically, CoS-places (right: 22.0 ± 2.9%; left: 17.4 ± 3.1%) has twice the percentage of connections to EVC as mFus-faces. These data further underscore that factors other than anatomical location determine the percentage of tracts between functional ROIs and EVC.

### Differential spatial computations in ventral and lateral face-selective regions are scaffolded by structural connections [^27e99d12]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To test the significance of endpoint distributions in EVC between streams, we ran a 2-way repeated-measures LMM ANOVA on the proportion of tract endpoints in EVC with factors of eccentricity band and stream. We found a significant eccentricity band × stream interaction in both hemispheres (right: F (3,264) = 7.9, p = 4.5 × 10 −5, η p 2 = 0.08; left: F (3200) = 19.5, p = 3.8 × 10 −11, η p 2 = 0.23). As with the proportion of pRF centers, post-hoc Tukey's tests establish that stream differences in both hemispheres are driven by a significantly higher proportion of tract endpoints in the most central eccentricity band (0–5°) in ventral vs. lateral face-selective regions (proportion higher in ventral than lateral, right: 0.12 ± 0.03, t (264) = 3.8, p = .0002, d = 0.23; left: 0.20 ± 0.04, t (200) = 5.0 p = 1.3 × 10 −6, d = 0.35), as well as a significantly lower proportion of centers for ventral vs. lateral regions in the most peripheral eccentricity band (proportion lower in ventral than lateral, 20–40°, right: 0.09 ± 0.03, t (264) = −2.8, p = .0056, d = 0.17; left: 0.16 ± 0.04, t (200) = −4.0, p = .0001, d = 0.29). To control for any effects of ROI size, we repeated this analysis with 5 mm disk ROIs, created at the center of each functionally defined region (Supplementary Fig. 7). As in the main analysis, a 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA on the proportion of fiber endpoints in EVC confirms significant eccentricity band × stream interactions in both hemispheres (right: F (3256) = 8.7, p = 1.65 × 10 −5, η p 2 = 0.09; left: F (3,200) = 17.3, p = 5.248 × 10 −10, η p 2 = 0.21).

### Arterial flow patterns in healthy transitioning near-term neonates [^1b657a94]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Table 4
Peripheral haemodynamic variables

The SMA showed the highest blood flow and largest variation with mean 16.1 mL/kg/min (SD 9.7, table 4), compared with brain with 5.8 mL/kg/min (SD 3.7) and kidney with 6.9 mL/kg/min (SD 9.4). SMA also had the highest Vmax with 70.6 cm/s (table 4). There were no significant changes to organ flow over time for any organ. Vmax of ACA significantly increased from 30.0 to 30.5 to 36.2 cm/s, in contrast to RA Vmax with a trend to decrease, and SMA Vmax remaining constant (table 4). Because PI and RI have been taken as a measure of resistance and because resistance is the reciprocal of conductance, we plotted relative conductance for the three organs (figure 3C), and 1/PI versus its respective conductance for ACA, SMA and RA (figure 3D–F). The claimed measure of conductance with 1/PI did not correlate with the organ flow. Each slope was essentially zero and R 2 ~0, indicating that the variance in organ conductance explained none of the variance in 1/PI. PI (and RI) are not measures of resistance.

Neither the aortic nor the pulmonic Vmax changed significantly over time; however, both respective central outputs (LVO and RVO) decreased significantly (table 3). PDA flow (if any) decreased significantly from being present in 20/21 infants during Time 1 and 2 to 7/19 infants at Time 3 (table 5). The most common PDA flow pattern was small left-to-right flow over the first two time points with closure at Time 3 in 6/21 (table 5). Two of the initial bidirectional PDA were large, nine additional bidirectional measurements were moderate and four left-to-right PDA were moderate. No infant had a bidirectional PDA flow at Time 3 and 7/19 infants had a small residual left-to-right PDA shunt at Time 3. Mild TR was noted in 5/21 at Time 1 and in 3/19 (different babies) at Time 3.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Eluryng) [^15078a27]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

How should I use EluRyng?

Read the Instructions for Use at the end of this Patient Information that comes with your EluRyng for information about the right way to use EluRyng.
Use EluRyng exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.
EluRyng is used in a 4-week cycle.
Insert 1 EluRyng in the vagina and keep it in place for 3 weeks (21 days).
Remove the EluRyng for a 1-week break (7 days). During the 1-week break (7 days), you will usually have your menstrual period.
For example, if you insert your EluRyng on a Monday at 8:00 am, you should remove it on the Monday 3 weeks later at 8:00 am.
After your 1-week (7 days) break, you should insert a new EluRyng on the next Monday at 8:00 am.
While using EluRyng, you should not use certain female barrier contraceptive methods such as a vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom as your back-up method of birth control because EluRyng may interfere with the correct placement and position of a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom.
Ring breakage has occurred when also using a vaginal product such as a lubricant or treatment for infection (see "What should I do if my EluRyng comes out of my vagina?"). Use of spermicides or vaginal yeast products will not make EluRyng less effective at preventing pregnancy.
Use of tampons will not make EluRyng less effective or stop EluRyng from working.
If EluRyng has been left inside your vagina for more than 4 weeks (28 days), you may not be protected from pregnancy and you should see your healthcare provider to be sure you are not pregnant. Until you know the results of your pregnancy test, you should use an extra method of birth control, such as male condoms with spermicide, until the new EluRyng has been in place for 7 days in a row.
Do not use more than 1 EluRyng at a time. Too much hormonal birth control medicine in your body may cause nausea, vomiting, or vaginal bleeding.

Conclusions

At end of the trial, both arms were almost pain-free, but the drop in pain in the treated arm was greater than in the control arm. This allows several different conclusions to be drawn on efficacy of platelet lysate in chronic refractory epicondylitis:

1) It is effective, since drop in pain was steeper in the treated arm
2) It is not effective, and improvement was due to the natural course of lateral epicondylitis
3) It is effective, and the parallel improvement in the untreated arm could have been mediated by the improvement in the treated arm, by allowing a more equal distribution of workload
4) Both arms benefited from participation into a clinical trial
5) More studies are needed.

### Effect of PET-CT misalignment on the quantitative accuracy of cardiacO-water PET [^6cc0edfc]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Global stress MBF ranged between 1.0 and 4.2 mL/g/min for all patients. For 5 patients, the results from 20 mm left-lateral misalignment (X + 20) were excluded since the resulting artifacts in PTF made the myocardial wall impossible to segment. Washout-based MBF was only to a minor extent affected by misalignments but larger effects were seen in uptake-based MBFt. In any of the three coronary regions, 5 misalignments showed a significant difference for MBF and 9 misalignments for MBFt. On the global level and across all misalignments, average absolute deviation for MBF was 1.7% ± 1.4% and for MBFt 5.4% ± 3.2%. ICC between misaligned and original images were excellent for MBF (≥ .98) and good for MBFt (≥ .87). Largest deviation for MBF was − 4.8% ± 5.8% (LCX, X + 20) and for MBFt − 19.3% ± 9.6% (LCX, X + 20). In Figure 1, polar plots are showing the effect of 20 mm left-lateral misalignment (X + 20) on MBF and MBFt for one patient. Linear regression and Bland–Altman analysis of one of the worst misalignments, 20 mm right-lateral misalignment (X − 20), are shown in Figure 2. Figures 3, 4 are scatter dot plots showing the relative deviations from the values based on correctly aligned PET and CT for MBF and MBFt, and corresponding relative deviations and ICC are shown in Tables 1, 2. Inter- and intra-observer agreement were excellent with ICC ≥ .95 for all parameters (Table 3).

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 400 mg [^da19f65b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.3	Peripheral Neuropathy

Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy.

### Can a prolonged healing pressure injury be benefited by using an AI mattress? A case study [^56ba29a8]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Using the AI device to detect bony prominences and to redistribute the pressure Panel (A), (B), (C) are pressure of lower extremities in different positions, flat, left, and right postures, respectively. The white dotted lines (square)were bony prominences Panel(D), (E) and (F) are pressure of lower extremities in different positions, flat, left, and right postures, respectively, after the pressure was redistributed The pressure in white squares decreased once the pressure was redistributed by the AI device

The case used the AI mattress for 4 weeks. Figure 4 shows that repositioning by the nursing home staff occurred every 3.10 ± 0.25 h. In total, the time lying on the bed increased from 5.79 ± 2.95 h per day in the first week to 9.89 ± 2.21 h in the 4th week (Fig. 5). Regarding the total time spent on the bed in different positions, the time spent supine or sitting up at 30° was the highest (8.89 ± 2.36 h/day), followed by the left side (8.57 ± 1.79 h/day) and right side (6.50 ± 0.78 h/day). Due to the use of the AI device, no new PIs developed, and the size of the original PI decreased. Interestingly, left-sided pressure in the scapula and hip was significantly higher than right-sided pressure (p < .05) during both day and night (Table 1). Photographs of the PI wounds were taken and measured weekly. The size of the wound was 2 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm 3 at the start of using the AI mattress. Four weeks later, the size had reduced to 2 × 1 × 1.2 cm 3 (stage 2), and the score of the PUSH was down to 6(Fig. 1).

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^f717477b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for aortic valve flow quantification — acquisition is prescribed perpendicular to the aortic root above the aortic valve, magnitude and phase images are used to contour the aortic wall and encode velocity, and a flow-time curve is generated by integrating velocity and area across the cardiac cycle; the illustrated dataset shows Forward: 138 mL, Reverse: 70 mL, and RF: 51%, with the caption noting the reverse (regurgitant) volume is 70 mL and the RF is 70 mL/138 mL or 51%.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^cfa4010d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 Colon Cancer — Primary tumor sidedness and EGFR inhibitors: In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), response to cetuximab or panitumumab differs by primary tumor location; in one analysis there were no responses in right-sided tumors versus a response rate of 41% in left-sided tumors with median PFS 2.3 versus 6.6 months (HR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.09–7.53; P < .0001). In CALGB/SWOG 80405, right-sided RAS wild-type primaries had longer OS with bevacizumab than cetuximab (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.93–1.99; P = 0.10), whereas left-sided primaries had longer OS with cetuximab than bevacizumab (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99; P = 0.04), with OS 39.3 vs. 32.6 months for left-sided and 13.6 vs. 29.2 months for right-sided. These and other data suggest that cetuximab and panitumumab confer little if any benefit to patients with mCRC if the primary tumor originated on the right side. For first-line treatment, only patients whose primary tumors originated on the left side of the colon (splenic flexure to rectum) should be offered cetuximab or panitumumab in the first-line treatment of metastatic disease; in subsequent lines, all patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors can be considered for panitumumab or cetuximab if neither was previously given.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: multiple myeloma, version 1.2025 [^d46a09cf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Daratumumab — phase I/II outcomes and NCCN option: In a phase I/II study, patients who had received more than three lines of therapy including an IMiD and a PI or were double refractory to PI and IMiD were randomized to two different doses of daratumumab (8 mg/kg vs. 16 mg/kg); among 106 patients who received 16 mg/kg, the ORR was 29.2% in 31 patients (3 sCR, 10 VGPR, and 18 PR), the median duration of response was 7.4 months, median TTP was 3.7 months, and the estimated 1-year OS rate was 65%. Adverse events reported were fatigue (39.6%), anemia (33.0%), nausea (29.2%), and thrombocytopenia (25.5%); grade 1 and 2 infusion-related reactions were seen in 42.5% of patients, mainly during first infusion, and no patients discontinued the study due to infusion-related reactions. Based on the above phase II results and FDA approval, the panel has added daratumumab as an option for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a PI and an IMiD or who are double refractory to a PI and IMiD.

### Chest X-ray findings and temporal lung changes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^f86f54a4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

During the study period, three patients (23%) progressed rapidly over an average period of 4 days with increase in the total chest x-ray severity score on average from 1 to 7. Only one elderly female patient (80 years) passed away at day 18 of onset of symptoms (Fig. 1). Nine patients (69%) showed improvement in the chest x-ray findings with almost complete resolution of the abnormalities (Fig. 2). The chest x-ray findings in one patient remained stable.
