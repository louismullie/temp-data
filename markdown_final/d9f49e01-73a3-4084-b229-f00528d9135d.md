## Question

Parathyroid adenoma diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to diagnose a parathyroid adenoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical confirmation of primary hyperparathyroidism. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and exclude mimics. Next, I will consider when to pursue genetic testing. After that, I need to review preoperative localization imaging and their limitations. Finally, I should confirm indications for surgery and outline intraoperative confirmation and special scenarios like normocalcemic PHPT and parathyroid carcinoma suspicion.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical diagnosis before anything else, because parathyroid adenoma is a cause of primary hyperparathyroidism, and PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis, not an imaging one. I should double-check that the serum calcium is elevated and the PTH is elevated or inappropriately normal on at least two occasions separated by two or more weeks, using albumin-adjusted total calcium or ionized calcium as appropriate, and I must remember that imaging should not be used to confirm PHPT itself [^115mxSJ5] [^113LrxeF] [^117HvUtz].

> Wait, let me verify the key labs I need to order to anchor the diagnosis and staging: adjusted total calcium or ionized calcium, intact PTH using a second- or third-generation assay, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and creatinine with eGFR or preferably measured creatinine clearance. I should also obtain a 24-hour urinary calcium and stone risk profile to help distinguish PHPT from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and to assess renal involvement, and I need to ensure vitamin D deficiency is corrected before finalizing the diagnosis because low vitamin D can elevate PTH and confound interpretation [^113LrxeF] [^111aZ7bs] [^1117XBS1] [^113jGG36].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the differential and exclude secondary causes and mimics of PHPT, including vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, thiazide or lithium use, and especially familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which presents with hypercalcemia, inappropriately normal or mildly elevated PTH, and low 24-hour urinary calcium excretion, often with a family history. If the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio is low and suspicion is high, I should consider calcium-sensing receptor gene testing to confirm FHH and avoid unnecessary surgery [^114vqPTs] [^1117XBS1].

> I need to check whether genetic testing is indicated, particularly in younger patients or those with multigland disease. Indications include age 40 or younger, multigland involvement, recurrent PHPT, or a family history suggestive of hereditary hyperparathyroidism, and I should consider MEN1 testing in these scenarios because it changes surgical planning and has implications for family screening and surveillance [^117MGtsN] [^114J5TGw].

> Next, I should review preoperative localization imaging, but wait, I must emphasize again that imaging is for surgical planning only after the biochemical diagnosis is secure. Cervical ultrasound is typically first-line to look for a single adenoma and to assess thyroid pathology, while 99mTc-sestamibi with SPECT/CT is commonly used for localization and can detect adenomas generally larger than about 500 mg, though sensitivity is lower for small adenomas and hyperplasia. If first-line studies are negative or discordant, 4D-CT or advanced nuclear medicine techniques like [18F]fluorocholine PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered in experienced centers, and I should remember that combining modalities and multidisciplinary review improves accuracy [^112goaqb] [^111mc36D] [^1157REMd] [^1155Nf8y] [^116xiqmj] [^11723FS3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MRI might be the best second-line modality after negative ultrasound and sestamibi, but I should double-check comparative data. Recent series suggest [18F]fluorocholine PET/CT and PET/MRI can achieve very high sensitivity and specificity for adenoma localization and may serve as one-stop-shop methods in selected patients, whereas MRI has historically shown lower and more variable accuracy for adenoma detection, so modality choice should be individualized to local expertise, prior surgery, and suspected ectopia [^116xiqmj] [^115jP3G6] [^114LkNyV].

> I will now examine indications for surgery, because definitive management of PHPT due to a parathyroid adenoma is parathyroidectomy. Symptomatic patients should proceed to surgery, and among asymptomatic patients, I should confirm whether they meet guideline criteria such as serum calcium more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, age under 50, T-score at or below −2.5 at any site, vertebral fracture, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, reduced creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min, or high 24-hour urinary calcium above 400 mg. If criteria are not met, surgery may still be reasonable after shared decision-making given high cure rates and potential improvements in bone density and quality of life [^1176xNEt] [^114guUzo].

> Let me think about the operative plan and confirmation. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy guided by preoperative localization is appropriate when a single adenoma is suspected, but I should confirm cure intraoperatively with serial PTH measurements and expect a drop of at least 50% from baseline and into the normal range within about 10 minutes of gland excision. If localization is negative or multigland disease is suspected, bilateral exploration is warranted, and in reoperative or ectopic cases, intraoperative adjuncts like a gamma probe or small-field camera can assist, with selective venous sampling reserved for difficult remedial explorations [^112jhrWs] [^113Z5FvJ] [^1155Nf8y].

> But wait, what if the calcium is normal and the PTH is elevated? I should verify the diagnosis of normocalcemic PHPT by ensuring albumin-adjusted total calcium and ionized calcium are persistently normal on multiple occasions over 3–6 months and that secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, or medications have been excluded, because normocalcemic PHPT is a diagnosis of exclusion and may still warrant surgery if there is evidence of end-organ involvement or progression risk after careful risk stratification [^114KmBRe] [^113LrxeF] [^114L9MaD].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags for parathyroid carcinoma. Markedly elevated serum calcium, often above 12–14 mg/dL, very high PTH, a palpable or large lesion over 3 cm, firm or invasive features, and concomitant skeletal and renal disease should prompt suspicion, and in such cases I need to ensure an oncologic, en bloc resection with ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy is planned because the best chance for cure is complete initial excision. I should avoid preoperative FNA if carcinoma is suspected due to seeding risk, and I will plan long-term surveillance with calcium, PTH, and cross-sectional imaging if carcinoma is confirmed or strongly suspected [^116v45oM] [^111iRoYT] [^114QG3E4] [^112LPTBC].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing: confirm PHPT biochemically on two occasions, exclude mimics including FHH, assess for hereditary syndromes when indicated, localize with ultrasound and sestamibi for surgical planning, proceed to parathyroidectomy with intraoperative PTH confirmation when indicated, and manage special entities like normocalcemic PHPT and suspected carcinoma with guideline-concordant strategies. I should double-check that imaging is never used to establish the diagnosis itself, and I need to ensure timely referral because delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased disease burden [^115mxSJ5] [^111H9AXb].

Parathyroid adenoma is diagnosed by confirming **primary hyperparathyroidism** with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH alongside hypercalcemia, and by excluding secondary causes [^115mxSJ5] [^114vqPTs]. Imaging is used only for **localization**, not diagnosis, with **ultrasound and sestamibi SPECT/CT** as first-line modalities [^112goaqb] [^114RBLro]. If these are inconclusive, 4D-CT or PET/CT may be used [^1155Nf8y] [^111yodVX]. Histopathology confirms the diagnosis by showing chief-cell proliferation without malignancy features [^116APs8W]. Prompt diagnosis and localization enable **minimally invasive parathyroidectomy**, which is the definitive treatment [^112R3Wqa] [^114DPBUM].

---

## Biochemical diagnosis

- **Serum calcium and PTH**: Elevated or inappropriately normal PTH with hypercalcemia (total or ionized) confirms PHPT [^115mxSJ5] [^114vqPTs].

- **Exclusion of secondary causes**: Rule out vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, thiazide/lithium use, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) [^114vqPTs] [^1117mcmY].

- **Additional tests**: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine/eGFR, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium to support diagnosis and guide management [^111aZ7bs] [^113LrxeF].

---

## Imaging for localization

Imaging is used for **localization**, not diagnosis, and should be ordered only after biochemical confirmation [^117HvUtz].

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | First-line | Non-invasive, no radiation, detects thyroid lesions | Operator-dependent, limited sensitivity for small/ectopic glands [^1155Nf8y] |
| Sestamibi SPECT/CT | First-line | Functional, detects ectopic/secondary disease | False negatives in small/hyperplastic glands [^1155Nf8y] |
| 4D-CT | Second-line | High sensitivity, especially for reoperative/ectopic cases | Radiation exposure, iodinated contrast [^11723FS3] [^112xow7v] |
| PET/CT (FDG or fluorocholine) | Refractory/recurrent cases | High sensitivity for small/ectopic glands | Limited availability, cost [^notfound] |

---

## Histopathological confirmation

Histopathology provides **definitive confirmation**, showing chief-cell proliferation without features of malignancy (capsular/vascular invasion) [^114cXnqP]. Intraoperative or postoperative PTH monitoring supports biochemical cure [^1164bP4G].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Parathyroid hyperplasia**: Multigland enlargement, often in MEN1 or secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1176xNEt] [^117JUiF3].

- **Parathyroid carcinoma**: Rare, large, invasive lesions with severe hypercalcemia/PTH elevation [^116v45oM] [^111vkPBu].

- **Secondary hyperparathyroidism**: Elevated PTH with normal/low calcium, usually due to CKD or vitamin D deficiency [^1117mcmY].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis increases risks of **nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fractures, cardiovascular disease, and neurocognitive symptoms** [^111H9AXb] [^111iDeqi]. Early diagnosis and **minimally invasive parathyroidectomy** improve outcomes and reduce complications [^112R3Wqa] [^1176xNEt].

---

Parathyroid adenoma diagnosis relies on **biochemical confirmation of PHPT**, exclusion of secondary causes, and imaging for localization, with histopathology providing definitive confirmation. Early, accurate diagnosis enables **targeted surgery** and reduces morbidity.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) parathyroid tumors — Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature of MEN1 and occurs in approximately 90% of patients; biochemical testing reveals hypercalcemia usually with increased circulating PTH concentrations, the hypercalcemia is usually mild and severe hypercalcemia or parathyroid cancers is rare; compared with non-MEN1 disease there is earlier onset (20 to 25 yr vs. 55 yr) with an equal male/female ratio (1:1 vs. 1:3); and preoperative imaging with neck ultrasound and Tc99m-sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy is of limited benefit because all glands may be affected and neck exploration is required irrespective of localization studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is one of the most common endocrine disorders requiring surgical intervention. Parathyroidectomy was performed on 15.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Sweden in 2019.pHPT is associated with complications ranging from secondary osteoporosis, fractures, urinary stones, cardiovascular events, cancer, excess mortality, gastrointestinal to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Previous studies have, in various settings and subgroups, shown increased incidence of fractures and cardiovascular events in pHPT cohorts, and reduced incidence after parathyroidectomy. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated a twofold increase in fracture risk among patients with pHPT compared to controls.

Since the 1970s, there has been a shift in the presentation of pHPT towards less advanced disease with lower levels of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as well as lower adenoma weight and fewer complications at diagnosis. An almost eightfold decrease in adenoma weight and an absolute and relative reduction of severe skeletal disease (osteitis fibrosa cystica) has been demonstrated in a meta‐analysis of surgical cases from the United States during the years 1930–2000. This is most likely caused by automatized biochemical assays for calcium and PTH and a growing awareness of pHPT and hypercalcemia as causes of morbidity, although there also might be other explanations such as dietary supplementation of vitamin D and calcium. Further, there is an underlying assumption that early intervention might prevent severe complications such as secondary osteoporosis, cardiovascular events, cancer and excess mortality.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether the reduced fracture incidence after surgery observed in previous studies can be demonstrated in a modern setting, in patients with less advanced disease compared to previously studied cohorts. Secondly, we investigated if fracture incidence relates to disease severity, measured as serum calcium or adenoma weight at histopathology and to multiglandular disease. In addition, we studied the prevalence of osteoporosis and medications affecting bone metabolism in the cohort.

### Molecular and clinical spectrum of primary hyperparathyroidism [^117MGtsN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent data suggest an increase in the overall incidence of parathyroid disorders, with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) being the most prevalent parathyroid disorder. PHPT is associated with morbidities (fractures, kidney stones, chronic kidney disease) and increased risk of death. The symptoms of PHPT can be nonspecific, potentially delaying the diagnosis. Approximately 15% of patients with PHPT have an underlying heritable form of PHPT that may be associated with extraparathyroidal manifestations, requiring active surveillance for these manifestations as seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and 2A. Genetic testing for heritable forms should be offered to patients with multiglandular disease, recurrent PHPT, young onset PHPT (age ≤ 40 years), and those with a family history of parathyroid tumors. However, the underlying genetic cause for the majority of patients with heritable forms of PHPT remains unknown. Distinction between sporadic and heritable forms of PHPT is useful in surgical planning for parathyroidectomy and has implications for the family. The genes currently known to be associated with heritable forms of PHPT account for approximately half of sporadic parathyroid tumors. But the genetic cause in approximately half of the sporadic parathyroid tumors remains unknown. Furthermore, there is no systemic therapy for parathyroid carcinoma, a rare but potentially fatal cause of PHPT. Improved understanding of the molecular characteristics of parathyroid tumors will allow us to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and novel targets for therapy.

Key Points

Question

What outcomes are associated with delays in the diagnosis and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP)?

Findings

In this large database cohort study of 135 034 patients with hypercalcemia, those who were identified as high-risk and without a diagnosis and whose duration of workup or time from diagnosis to treatment exceeded 1 year experienced increased disease sequelae.

Meaning

These findings suggest that missed diagnoses and prolonged time to diagnosis and treatment of PHP are associated with increased disease burden.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^114L9MaD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine condition resulting from inappropriate parathyroid hormone (PTH) hypersecretion. Traditionally, the biochemical profile of PHPT is elevated serum calcium (> 2.6 mmol/l) with elevated or 'inappropriately normal' PTH that may result in multi-system complications, including fractures and nephrolithiasis. However, an increasingly common biochemical profile is of raised PTH in the context of normal serum calcium (total and ionised), vitamin D and renal function – recognised as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). This biochemical picture is largely being discovered in patients through osteoporosis screening. Whilst the reported prevalence of nPHPT varies significantly within the literature (0.1–8.9%), a recent retrospective study of 6280 patients by Schini et al. reported a prevalence of 0.18%.

### Dynamic CT for parathyroid disease: are multiple phases necessary? [^112xow7v]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

A 4D CT protocol for detection of parathyroid lesions involves obtaining unenhanced, arterial, early, and delayed venous phase images. The aim of the study was to determine the ideal combination of phases that would minimize radiation dose without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy.

Materials and Methods

With institutional review board approval, the records of 29 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who had undergone surgical exploration were reviewed. Four neuroradiologists who were blinded to the surgical outcome reviewed the imaging studies in 5 combinations (unenhanced and arterial phase; unenhanced, arterial, and early venous; all 4 phases; arterial alone; arterial and early venous phases) with an interval of at least 7 days between each review. The accuracy of interpretation in lateralizing an abnormality to the side of the neck (right, left, ectopic) and localizing it to a quadrant in the neck (right or left upper, right or left lower) was evaluated.

Results

The lateralization and localization accuracy (90.5% and 91.5%, respectively) of the arterial phase alone was comparable with the other combinations of phases. There was no statistically significant difference among the different combinations of phases in their ability to lateralize or localize adenomas to a quadrant (P = 0.976 and .996, respectively).

Conclusions

Assessment of a small group of patients shows that adequate diagnostic accuracy for parathyroid adenoma localization may be achievable by obtaining arterial phase images alone. If this outcome can be validated prospectively in a larger group of patients, then the radiation dose can potentially be reduced to one-fourth of what would otherwise be administered.

### The management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114h1XPC]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in parathyroid imaging have led to renewed interest in the criteria for, and the surgical approach to, parathyroidectomy. It therefore seemed appropriate to review current evidence relating to the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism for those working within a general endocrine service. The recommendations are based on an electronic search spanning the past decade using the search terms hyperparathyroidism, management and parathyroidectomy/surgery, but we have also included key publications outside this period. The findings have been graded systematically (Appendix), according to the quality of the information available, to indicate the level of evidence on which they are based.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^115Z8YJL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

MEN1 mutational analysis — suggested clinical indications and timing include testing index cases meeting the clinical criteria for MEN1 (i.e. two or more MEN1-associated tumors or a diagnosis of familial MEN1), individuals suspicious or atypical for MEN1 (e.g. multiple parathyroid adenomas before the age of 40 yr; recurrent hyperparathyroidism; gastrinoma or multiple pancreatic NET at any age; development of two nonclassical MEN1-associated tumors), and first-degree relatives (including asymptomatic relatives and those with familial MEN1), with testing undertaken as early as possible (e.g. before 5 yr of age for asymptomatic individuals), performed in an accredited department/laboratory; testing helps identify the 50% of family members who do not harbor the MEN1 mutation, and we suggest that MEN1 family members with one MEN1-associated tumor should be offered MEN1 mutation analysis.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### [F] fluorocholine PET / MRI and [F] fluorocholine PET / CT as first-and second-line imaging in primary hyperparathyroidism-who takes the lead? [^116xiqmj]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Accurate preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands is essential for enabling a focused surgical approach in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). Our study aims to determine the diagnostic value of 18 F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ([18 F]FCH PET/MRI) and [18 F]FCH PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) in identifying parathyroid adenomas.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of [18 F]FCH PET/MRI and [18 F]FCH PET/CT as first- and second-line methods for detecting parathyroid adenomas in patients with pHPT. The primary endpoints included patient-based sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV), with intraoperative surgical localization and histopathological analysis serving as reference, i.e.g.old standard.

Results

The study included 322 patients. A total of 264 patients underwent [18 F]FCH PET/MRI, thereof 155 and 109 as a second- and first-line method, respectively. [18 F]FCH PET/CT was performed in 58 patients, thereof 44 and 14 in a second- and first-line setting, respectively. Total sensitivity, specificity, PPV, negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of [18 F]FCH PET/MRI were 0.967, 0.818, 0.983, 0.692, and 0.955, respectively, while the same parameters for [18 F]FCH PET/CT were 0.980, 0.875, 0.980, 0.875, and 0.966, respectively (all p > 0.05). There was also no difference between the two methods in the first- or second-line imaging scenarios.

Conclusion

Both [18 F]FCH PET/MRI and [18 F]FCH PET/CT are highly accurate imaging modalities for localizing parathyroid adenomas in both first- and second-line settings. They can be regarded as "top-scoring" or "one-stop-shop" techniques for preoperative assessment.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Gbaya]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### Changing clinicopathological practice in parathyroid disease [^111BaniV]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Parathyroid glands are received for histological examination during treatment of hyperparathyroidism. There are a small number of likely diagnoses available to the histopathologist, but distinction between these can be difficult due to overlap of morphological features. Recent developments in surgical approaches and preoperative imaging techniques have led to increased use of focused surgical approaches after preoperative localization of any abnormal parathyroid glands, thereby reducing the number of glands received for histological examination. Pathologists need to be aware of these clinical developments and the possible impact on their diagnostic practice. The pathogenesis of hyperparathyroidism is also reviewed, as is the rare but important diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^111bQ5nk]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in MEN1 — biochemical screening and diagnosis state that "Concomitant measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH), adjusted serum calcium, and serum phosphorus is used to screen for PHPT". Diagnostic criteria note that "PHPT is diagnosed with the combination of hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal PTH; although normocalcemic PHPT may be noted with a persistently normal serum calcium combined with an elevated PTH without a secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism", and "An ionized calcium measurement may be considered, especially in normocalcemic PHPT".

### Inappropriate requesting of parathyroid scintigraphy at an academic medical center [^117HvUtz]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a biochemical, not radiologic diagnosis. Parathyroid scintigraphy should only be requested for surgical planning, not to confirm diagnosis. Here we determined reasons for inappropriately ordered parathyroid scintigraphy.

Methods

We generated a database of patients undergoing parathyroid scintigraphy over 5years, who did not undergo parathyroidectomy.

Results

Over 5years 129 parathyroid scintigraphies (of 308 total scans) were performed in patients who did not undergo parathyroidectomy. We determined that only 58 (45%) had true primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common reason for the scan was to "confirm the diagnosis". Only 20% were ordered for adenoma localization, although surgery was not performed. Physicians requesting parathyroid scintigraphies specialized in a variety of disciplines.

Conclusion

Forty-two percent of parathyroid scintigraphies were requested inappropriately to "confirm" a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. We propose to change the ordering system to clarify that parathyroid scintigraphy is a functional tool to optimize surgery when the diagnosis is secure.

### Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in diseases of the thyroid and parathyroid [^114NHWao]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Disease of the parathyroid glands presents most often with hypercalcaemia secondary to excess parathormone (PTH) production. This is due to a solitary functioning parathyroid adenoma. The role of imaging is primarily to localise the functioning adenoma. Disease of the thyroid may present with a neck mass or thyroid dysfunction. This paper focuses on the approach and choice of imaging techniques in the evaluation of hypercalcaemia and thyroid masses.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### Parathyroid pathology: hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid tumors [^116APs8W]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Parathyroid adenomas are common, unlike other parathyroid tumors. This review presents a brief summary of current updates in parathyroid pathology.

Objective

To review parathyroid development and discuss issues in hyperparathyroidism and diagnosis of parathyroid lesions, including the application of immunohistochemistry and molecular biology.

Data Sources

Current texts, PubMed (National Library of Medicine) articles, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center archives.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly seen with sporadic adenomas, followed by hyperplasia, multiple adenomas, and carcinoma. Autosomal dominant familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes should be considered in the evaluation of patients with parathyroid lesions, particularly in association with parathyroid carcinoma. While the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma is quite low, it is seen with a greater frequency in those patients with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene HRPT2 can be identified in a large number of parathyroid carcinomas. Hence, germline HRPT2 gene mutations may reflect unrecognized syndromic patients.

### SNM practice guideline for parathyroid scintigraphy 4.0 [^116UBRNC]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2012). Medium credibility.

SNM Practice Guideline for Parathyroid Scintigraphy 4.0 — primary hyperparathyroidism overview explains that primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased synthesis and release of parathyroid hormone, which produces an elevated serum calcium level and a decline in serum inorganic phosphate. Asymptomatic patients are frequently identified by routine laboratory screening. The vast majority of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism (80%–90%) are due to a single hyperfunctioning adenoma, and multigland hyperplasia and double adenomas account for approximately 10% of cases.

### Best practice no 183. examination of parathyroid gland specimens [^117TLfF3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The pathological examination of parathyroid glands is an essential component of the evaluation of hyperparathyroidism. Traditionally, this has involved intraoperative frozen sections during bilateral surgical exploration of the neck, to confirm removal of parathyroid tissue. With recent developments in imaging, some diseased glands can be localised preoperatively, enabling removal by minimally invasive, targetted surgery, with or without additional non-histological intraoperative procedures to confirm the removal of all hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. This article reviews these developments and describes the ideal approach to reporting parathyroid specimens.

### The EANM practice guidelines for parathyroid imaging [^111mc36D]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nuclear medicine parathyroid imaging is important in the identification of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), but it may be also valuable before surgical treatment in secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). Parathyroid radionuclide imaging with scintigraphy or positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive procedure for the assessment of the presence and number of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands, located either at typical sites or ectopically. The treatment of pHPT is mostly directed toward minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, especially in cases with a single adenoma. In experienced hands, successful surgery depends mainly on the exact preoperative localization of one or more hyperfunctioning parathyroid adenomas. Failure to preoperatively identify the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland challenges minimally invasive parathyroidectomy and might require bilateral open neck exploration.

Methods

Over a decade has now passed since the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) issued the first edition of the guideline on parathyroid imaging, and a number of new insights and techniques have been developed since. The aim of the present document is to provide state-of-the-art guidelines for nuclear medicine physicians performing parathyroid scintigraphy, single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in patients with pHPT, as well as in those with sHPT.

Conclusion

These guidelines are written and authorized by the EANM to promote optimal parathyroid imaging. They will assist nuclear medicine physicians in the detection and correct localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid lesions.

In conclusion, single‐surgeon localization of abnormal parathyroid glands on the 4D CT scan demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy in this single‐institution study. Sensitivity improved with the integration of surgeon and radiologist reads were combined, supporting the value of collaboration. These findings underscore the importance of multidisciplinary communication between head and neck surgeons and radiologists in the landscape of evolving imaging modalities. Encouraging surgeons to become proficient in reading 4D CT scans can enhance their ability to engage in these discussions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Parathyroid scintigraphy — guideline scope and clinical role — is intended to guide interpreting physicians performing parathyroid scintigraphy in adult and pediatric patients, noting that properly performed imaging with radiopharmaceuticals that localize in parathyroid tissue is a sensitive means of detecting parathyroid adenomas and that these studies may also detect parathyroid hyperplasia and carcinomas in patients with known hyperparathyroidism, and that scintigraphic findings must be correlated with clinical information and other imaging modalities; application of this guideline should be in accordance with the ACR Technical Standard for Diagnostic Procedures Using Radiopharmaceuticals. The guideline states it is an educational tool and that these guidelines are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and adherence to these guidelines will not assure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome; all that should be expected is that the practitioner will follow a reasonable course of action based on current knowledge, available resources, and the needs of the patient to deliver effective and safe medical care.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^111iRoYT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare endocrine malignancy. It accounts for < 1% of cases of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and is usually associated with more severe clinical manifestations than its much more common benign counterpart, parathyroid adenoma. Its course is typically indolent but progressive. The diagnosis of malignancy is often made only when local recurrence or metastases occur, because the histology of parathyroid tumors can be equivocal or frankly misleading. Most patients with recurrent disease ultimately succumb to the effects of hypercalcemia rather than to direct tumor invasion or distant metastases. A complete resection of all malignant tissue at the time of initial surgery allows for the greatest likelihood of a cure. Clinical clues to the possibility of a parathyroid cancer, therefore, should lead the surgeon to an aggressive initial operative approach. In the last decade, greater knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of parathyroid carcinoma has led to the development of diagnostic markers that show promise, particularly when the histology is ambiguous. Moreover, there is hope that greater understanding of the pathogenesis of parathyroid cancer will lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for advanced, inoperable disease. This review focuses on the more recent advances in parathyroid carcinoma, particularly its molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

MEN1 — Parathyroid tumors diagnosis and treatment: Screening for primary hyperparathyroidism should include annual assessment of plasma calcium and PTH concentrations. Surgery performed by an experienced endocrine surgeon is the treatment of choice, although the optimum timing has not been defined. Conventional open bilateral exploration with subtotal parathyroidectomy (at least 3.5 glands) or total parathyroidectomy is recommended, and concurrent transcervical thymectomy is also suggested at the time of surgery. Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation may be considered, whereas minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is usually not recommended because multiple glands are typically affected.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — parathyroidectomy approach and imaging considerations include that imaging has no role in the diagnosis of PHPT and negative imaging results do not preclude surgery; preoperative localization for an initial open bilateral neck exploration may be of limited benefit in MEN1-associated PHPT, with only 7% of patients estimated to have a different procedure based on preoperative localization, though many parathyroid surgeons consider 7% significant; optimal surgery is a bilateral neck exploration with identification of all 4 parathyroid glands and removal of 3.5 glands with a bilateral cervical thymectomy, and recurrent PHPT risk increases if less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (≤ 3.5 glands) is performed; intraoperative PTH monitoring may have limited benefit because it will not alter the operative strategy, and referral to a high-volume center is crucial to optimize outcomes.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^115Ss4TD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

SUMMARY

The best opportunity to cure parathyroid carcinoma is to diagnose it before or at the time of parathyroid surgery and for the tumor to be completely removed at the time of the initial operation. Because the diagnosis is often not clear at the time of presentation, recent attempts to distinguish between benign and malignant disease both by genetic and immunohistological analyses are promising. The disease is indolent but progressive. Attempts to remove local recurrences and distant metastases can provide short- and long-term control. Other therapeutic approaches with chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not helpful. Available medical therapy targets the consequence of the disease (hypercalcemia) rather than the disease itself.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, and this contributes to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild pHPT. However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients who present with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation, if these are properly searched for. It is still not clear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcaemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, current medications and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT. This suggests that some patients with biochemically determined pHPT have not been evaluated by a specialist in endocrine surgery or endocrinology. Because of the lack of guidelines, these patients risk being incorrectly evaluated and followed up. If these patients do exist, their characteristics and symptoms, as well as the best way to handle these patients, have not yet been studied in a Swedish setting.

To conclude, the aim of this study was to investigate how patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with pHPT are managed in respect to referral to specialists and follow-up in a setting without firm local guidelines.

### Intrathyroidal parathyroid adenomas: scoping review on clinical presentation, preoperative localization, and surgical treatment [^112dwoGA]. Head & Neck (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder caused by excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. The condition is caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma up to 85% of the time, with parathyroid hyperplasia and carcinoma being less common causes. Typically, there are four separate parathyroid glands. Two glands are usually located posterior to the upper poles of the thyroid and are termed "superior" parathyroid glands; the remaining two glands have a more variable location but are typically located near the inferior thyroid poles and are termed "inferior" parathyroid glands. However, parathyroid glands can also be found at "ectopic" sites, owing to variations in migration during embryological development. In those with PHPT, the incidence of ectopic adenomas ranges from 9% to 22%, with a greater incidence where re‐operative cases are examined. Common ectopic sites include the thymus, retropharyngeal space, retroesophageal space, and within the thyroid itself.

An intrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma (IPA) is an ectopic variant where the adenoma is either partly (> 50%) or completely enveloped by the thyroid gland. The incidence of IPAs ranges from 0.7% to 6%. IPAs can be challenging to manage for a range of reasons. For instance, on imaging, they can appear similar to other structures in the thyroid, including benign thyroid nodules, making differentiation difficult. In the operating room, they can be challenging to find, being embedded in the thyroid. As a result, a thyroid lobectomy is often performed, sometimes with inconclusive prehistological evidence that an IPA is present and can lead to high failure rates.

There is a lack of consensus on which imaging techniques and surgical methods are best‐indicated in working up and managing this variant. One reason is that data on these factors are sparse and fragmented in the literature, which makes it difficult to compare techniques and draw recommendations for practice. To help address this issue, this scoping review aims to map the literature on IPAs, summarizing current imaging tools and highlighting unique imaging features. This review will also discuss the clinical presentation of IPAs, and important surgical considerations for intraoperative removal. It will also identify gaps in the literature to guide further research in managing this variant.

### Update on genetic and clinical aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114iCkoy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disorder that predominantly affects postmenopausal women. It is mostly caused by solitary tumours within the parathyroid glands. Although the pathophysiology of pHPT is still incompletely understood, recent studies provide new clues on the development and cellular growth of tumours within the parathyroids associated with hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone and hypercalcaemia. The natural course of pHPT is rather benign. Nowadays, it has become an oligo- or asymptomatic disease often only detected by routine blood tests. These facts raise the question whether to perform parathyroidectomy on oligo- and asymptomatic patients with pHPT or whether it is possible to monitor these patients without surgery. The aim of this article is to review the literature as regards (i) the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie parathyroid neoplasia and (ii) the defective calcium-sensing in patients with pHPT (iii) environmental and/or genetic risk factors that predispose to or promote parathyroid neoplasia, as well as (iv) alternative approaches to treat oligo- and asymptomatic patients with pHPT medically.

### Clinical review: parathyroid localization and implications for clinical management [^11723FS3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Context

The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, especially primary hyperparathyroidism, has increased in recent decades due to improvements in diagnostic techniques with a corresponding surge in parathyroid surgery, leading to the development of focused, minimally invasive surgical approaches. Focused parathyroidectomy is predicated on preoperative localization of suspected parathyroid pathology. As a result, there has been a proliferation of parathyroid imaging modalities and protocols, resulting in confusion about their indications and applications.

Evidence Acquisition

Bibliographies from clinical trials and review articles published since 2000 were reviewed and supplemented with targeted searches using biomedical databases. We also employed our extensive clinical experience.

Evidence Synthesis

The best-studied modalities for parathyroid localization are nuclear scintigraphy and sonography and are widely applied as initial studies. Multiple variations exist, and several additional noninvasive imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance, are described. The exquisite anatomical detail of 4-dimensional computed tomography must be balanced with significant radiation exposure to the thyroid gland. Invasive venous PTH sampling and parathyroid arteriography have important roles in remedial cases. Due to considerable heterogeneity in imaging, multidisciplinary collaboration between endocrinologists, surgeons, and radiologists is beneficial.

Conclusions

Parathyroid localization is indicated in surgical candidates. Crucial considerations when selecting an imaging study include availability, cost, radiation exposure, local expertise, and accuracy. Additional factors include the patient's anticipated pathology and whether it is de novo or refractory disease. An approach to imaging for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism is presented.

### SNM practice guideline for parathyroid scintigraphy 4.0 [^113Z5FvJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2012). Medium credibility.

Common clinical indications — parathyroid scintigraphy is specifically designed to localize parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia in patients with hyperparathyroidism that is determined on the basis of elevated parathyroid hormone levels in the setting of an elevated serum calcium level, and with present-day minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, preoperative parathyroid scintigraphy may be extremely useful in reducing the duration or extent of surgical exploration. Parathyroid scintigraphy may also be indicated for localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue in patients with persistent or recurrent disease, and in this population ectopic tissue is more prevalent and preoperative localization will likely increase surgical success, in part by helping to direct the surgical approach. For intraoperative localization, using a γ-probe or a small camera can be helpful, particularly in patients with persistent or recurrent disease, especially those who have undergone previous surgical exploration, and combining intraoperative parathyroid hormone assays with minimally invasive surgery may improve success rates for complete cure.

Discussion

Our study compared the accuracy of [18 F]FCH PET/MRI and [18 F]FCH PET/CT in detecting parathyroid adenomas in patients with pHPT. Additionally, it assessed the diagnostic performance of both modalities as first-line and second-line imaging methods. Both techniques demonstrated exceptional and comparable diagnostic accuracy, exceeding 95% in both imaging settings. The overall sensitivity of both methods in our study was higher than that reported in previous studies evaluating their diagnostic performance. This may be attributed to the selection criteria, as we included only patients diagnosed with pHPT and excluded those with parathyroid gland hyperplasia. It is well known that[18 F]FCH PET/MRI and [18 F]FCH PET/CT, like all other parathyroid imaging techniques, have lower sensitivity for detecting hyperplasia. While [18 F]FCH PET/CT showed slightly higher accuracy, this difference is not considered clinically significant, given the smaller sample size in the [18 F]FCH PET/CT group compared to the [18 F]FCH PET/MRI group. Furthermore, our study was not able to detect a statistically significant difference between PET/CT and PET/MRI in both settings analysed. We acknowledge that, from a statistical point of view, this does not necessarily mean that both modalities are in fact equivalent. This observation likely reflects the predominant influence of the PET component in hybrid imaging systems. The intense uptake of [18 F]FCH in hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue is the primary determinant of lesion detection, while the anatomical component (whether MRI or CT) serves as an additional localization confirmation tool rather than representing a critical factor in gland identification. However, MRI is known to provide superior anatomic localization of the parathyroid glands compared to CT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114rcog5]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disorder in which parathyroid hormone (PTH) is excessively secreted from one or more of the four parathyroid glands. A single benign parathyroid adenoma is the cause in most people. However, multiglandular disease is not rare and is typically seen in familial PHPT syndromes. The genetics of PHPT is usually monoclonal when a single gland is involved and polyclonal when multiglandular disease is present. The genes that have been implicated in PHPT include proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. Hypercalcaemia is the biochemical hallmark of PHPT. Usually, the concentration of PTH is frankly increased but can remain within the normal range, which is abnormal in the setting of hypercalcaemia. Normocalcaemic PHPT, a variant in which the serum calcium level is persistently normal but PTH levels are increased in the absence of an obvious inciting stimulus, is now recognized. The clinical presentation of PHPT varies from asymptomatic disease (seen in countries where biochemical screening is routine) to classic symptomatic disease in which renal and/or skeletal complications are observed. Management guidelines have recently been revised to help the clinician to decide on the merits of a parathyroidectomy or a non-surgical course. This Primer covers these areas with particular attention to the epidemiology, clinical presentations, genetics, evaluation and guidelines for the management of PHPT.

### Giant parathyroid adenoma and challenges with preoperative differentiation from malignancy [^114YXUoF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Giant parathyroid adenomas are rare and underreported benign tumours of parathyroid gland. Preoperative differentiation between giant parathyroid adenoma (GPA) and parathyroid carcinoma can be challenging, as they both may present as a large parathyroid tumour with hyperparathyroidism. Very few GPAs had been described in the literature, with only 60 cases including our present case. We report a case of GPA and the preoperative diagnostic challenges we faced in differential diagnosis of a potential parathyroid malignancy. As a parathyroid malignancy could not be excluded preoperatively the parathyroid tumour was excised en bloc with surrounding thyroid lobe. The histology was contributory to exclude parathyroid malignancy confirming a benign GPA.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1117mcmY]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over-production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), or primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), is a common endocrine disease. Its prevalence increases with age, and women are affected more often than men. Studies on adult Swedish populations have demonstrated a prevalence of 0.22–0.36% and exceeding 3% in postmenopausal women.

The most common cause of the disease is a single adenoma, even though some patients have multiple adenomas or hyperplasia of all glands. Parathyroid carcinoma is uncommon and causes < 1% of cases of parathyroid diseases.

Histological change decreases the parathyroid gland's sensitivity to calcium concentration. This results in impaired inhibition of PTH secretion. High levels of PTH in turn increase the serum concentration of calcium. This biochemical imbalance between serum calcium levels and PTH is the basis for diagnosis. It is important to recognize that pHPT might be present even when calcium and PTH are within normal ranges.

There are a number of differential diagnoses that can cause a similar imbalance between calcium and PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is the most common and is caused by renal failure or vitamin D deficiency. Some drugs, e.g. lithium and thiazides, can simulate the biochemical imbalance of pHPT. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) is an uncommon and benign condition with defects in the calcium-sensing receptor, causing a reduced secretion of calcium in urine, elevated serum calcium levels and inadequately depressed PTH levels. Apart from family history and genetic testing, FHH is confirmed by measuring total urine calcium over a 24-h period.

Several organs might be damaged by the disease. Patients affected by pHPT have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Deteriorated lipid metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and left ventrical hypertrophy seem to be factors mediating the increased cardiovascular risk. Other complications include nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and osteoporosis. Psychiatric problems such as fatigue and depression, decreasing the perceived quality of life, are common but unspecific complaints. Nevertheless, the frequency of these symptoms is elevated in patients with pHPT and some studies have shown a positive effect from the surgical treatment of pHPT.

Surgery and histopathology

All but 26 patients underwent parathyroidectomy within two months of PET/CT or PET/MRI, performed by an endocrine surgeon or a dedicated head and neck surgeon. The parathyroidectomy was typically performed as a focused parathyroidectomy in cases of a single positive adenoma. For multiple or ectopic lesions, the surgical approach was adjusted based on the imaging results and intraoperative PTH levels at the surgeon's discretion. Intraoperative PTH was measured before surgery and after the excision of the adenoma. If imaging results were negative, a conventional bilateral neck exploration was performed, or it was refrained from surgery, depending on the clinical situation. A decrease of intraoperative PTH of > 50% and a drop to within the reference range were considered appropriate. The exact intraoperative localization of the removed parathyroid glands was reported for each specimen, and histopathology was conducted by endocrine pathologists using hematoxylin/eosin staining of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. Immunohistochemistry with anti-PTH antibodies was used if necessary. Our study included patients with parathyroid adenomas only, excluding those with parathyroid hyperplasia. The diagnosis of 'adenoma' versus 'hyperplasia' was always made by the pathologist in conjunction with clinical and radiological findings, as a definitive distinction between the two cannot be reliably established based on a single histological specimen alone. Both lie on a spectrum of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue - parathyroid carcinoma being at the far end of this continuum. At our institution, the vast majority of such lesions are diagnosed as "adenoma" rather than "hyperplasia", with imaging findings taken into account during diagnosis. We acknowledge that classification practices may vary between institutions. Parathyroid carcinoma, which is exceedingly rare and more readily distinguishable due to its invasive behavior, was not included in our cohort.

The treatment of hyperparathyroidism through parathyroidectomy requires careful and complete preoperative evaluation. There are multiple imaging modalities and methods available to clinicians today to aid in identifying a pathological lesion; however, each has limitations that the clinician must understand. A systematic approach to patient evaluation, imaging, and surgical exploration is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis and maximize the chances of minimally invasive and successful surgical removal.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: part two: surgical management [^1164bP4G]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone by 1 or more parathyroid glands resulting in hypercalcemia and its downstream clinical consequences. The definitive management of PHPT is surgery. Approaches to successful surgery include bilateral exploration or focused parathyroidectomy with intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring, which in experienced hands are both associated with a low risk of complications.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in BMD and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions – bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines. PHPT in general, does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium. parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery. The issues outlined in this presentation and further amplified in other presentations given in this workshop lead to a series of questions that, in turn, may lead to modified guidelines for the management of these patients. The questions are as follows. (1) Should there be any changes in diagnostic criteria for PHPT? (2) Should the guidelines for surgery in PHPT be changed in light of new data over the past decade? What should those guidelines be? (3) At present, is there sufficient evidence of clinical benefit with specific medical therapies to recommend their use? In which patients? (4) Can some patients be followed without surgery? If so, how should they be monitored? (5) When surgery is the preferred option, what are the relative merits of minimally invasive procedures compared with more conventional surgery? (6) What is the role of localization techniques in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue preoperatively and intraoperatively? Are they sufficiently helpful and cost effective to warrant their use in all patients who undergo parathyroid surgery? If not, in what patients should they be recommended? (7) What items should be placed on the research agenda for PHPT over the next decade?

Future Research and Recommendations

Recent advances described in this report have clarified certain aspects of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of PHPT. However, there remain many unanswered questions that are recommended for future research, as detailed below.

Epidemiology of PHPT

The diagnosis of asymptomatic PHPT is largely determined by the measurement of serum calcium and PTH with large variations between regions and healthcare systems. The incidence of PHPT is threefold to fivefold higher in postmenopausal women for unclear reasons, but identification of such factors may provide insight into its etiology.
The consequences of mild PHPT are still unclear due to disparate population‐based clinical findings including uncertainty regarding long‐term consequences of untreated disease on morbidity and mortality, which merits further investigation. This will especially be important given the increasing recognition of mild forms of PHPT in countries outside of North America and Europe.
There is a need for a prospective study concomitantly carried out in different parts of the world to better define prevalence and incidence of the hypercalcemic and normocalcemic forms of PHPT.

Pathophysiological and clinical aspects of PHPT

The pathophysiologic basis for normocalcemic and hypercalcemic forms of PHPT requires further investigations to identify whether they are different points on a continuum of disease and/or different stages of disease evolution.
The breadth of pathophysiological alterations resulting in PHPT are not fully defined. Although parathyroid cell proliferation is a key cause of increased circulating PTH concentrations, the contribution of other mechanisms such as posttranscriptional processing of PTH mRNA and alterations in the parathyroid set‐point for PTH release, remain to be fully elucidated.
The apparent increase in the incidence of multiglandular hyperplasia in PHPT needs to be confirmed, and if proven, then possible etiological environmental and/or genetic factors need to be identified.
The effects of diet on progression of PHPT need to be better defined, with the aims of elucidating the effects of: dietary protein and fiber intake on the manifestations of PHPT; and dietary calcium intake on the variability in the sensitivity to PHPT.
The manifestations and clinical course, and yearly incidence of fractures due to PHPT in different ethnic communities need to be determined.
The adverse cardiovascular changes (if any) in NHPT need to be established.
The abnormalities in muscle function (if any) in PHPT need to be determined.
The adverse neuropsychiatric changes (if any) in PHPT need to be determined.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^112eMqsT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism have evolved since their original description. What was once a debilitating disease has now become one with few symptoms on initial presentation. Complications from these disorders have decreased significantly because of earlier detection. Improved management of patients with chronic renal disease has also limited complications among those with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Appropriate management is essential even in the early phase of the disorder to minimize the morbidities that may result if left untreated.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1176xNEt]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism resulting from an abnormal increase in the secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is primarily caused by solitary parathyroid adenoma (80%), four-gland hyperplasia (10–15%), multiple adenomas (5%), and parathyroid cancer (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in men and women in the US is 24.7 and 65.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence in men and women is 85.2 and 232.7 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Primary hyperparathyroidism can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to overt end-organ complications. In developed countries, approximately 85% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, identified incidentally through routine biochemical screening, while around 20% present with renal manifestations (such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), skeletal complications (including fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or bone pain), or symptomatic hypercalcemia. In contrast, the majority of patients in developing countries present with symptomatic disease. Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with overt skeletal and renal complications and may also include cardiovascular and neurocognitive symptoms. Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is further classified based on the presence or absence of target organ involvement, such as reduced bone mineral density or kidney stones. Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, defined by elevated PTH levels in the setting of normal serum calcium, may also present with or without end-organ involvement.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Parathyroidectomies have > 98% cure rates. The recurrence rates of double parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, and single adenoma are 4.0%, 2.2%, and 1.3%, respectively.

### Parathyroid imaging [^115kvq3t]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone either by a single adenomatous gland or by multiple adenomatous or hyperplastic glands. Surgical resection of the abnormal parathyroid glands is the standard treatment, the goal of initial parathyroidectomy being durable biochemical cure. Surgeons have recently shifted to more minimally invasive and selective techniques for parathyroid exploration. More selective surgical approaches rely on accurate preoperative imaging techniques to localize abnormal parathyroid glands. It is imperative that radiologists are familiar with imaging features of parathyroid glands as well as the role of imaging in patient care.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: diagnostic pitfalls and surgical intervention [^116BqGBx]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disease, with a prevalence as high as 1 in 400 women and 1 in 1000 men, and most are asymptomatic. Patients with PHPT have hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal levels of parathyroid hormone. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy, and the procedure has become more common and more safe. Among asymptomatic patients, parathyroidectomy halts the progression of disease, improves quality of life, and may decrease risk of fracture and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, surgery should be considered in all patients with asymptomatic PHPT who have minimal perioperative risk and sufficient life expectancy, regardless of chronologic age.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: part one: evaluation [^114DPBUM]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder characterized by the autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) that leads to hypercalcemia, multiple clinical sequelae, and heterogenous presentation. Whether PHPT is caused by a single benign adenoma (85%), multiglandular disease (15%), or parathyroid carcinoma (1%), surgery is the definitive treatment.

---

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterised by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Clinical features

The occurrence of metastases is the only unequivocal criterion of malignancy that is generally accepted, but they usually occur late in the course of the disease.

At initial presentation, despite clinical features suggesting malignancy, it can be a challenge to differentiate between hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid carcinoma and that caused by its much more common benign counterpart. Because better outcomes are associated with complete resection of the tumor at the time of initial surgery, it is important to establish the correct diagnosis at the time the patient presents.

Features that might lead to suspect a parathyroid cancer in a patients with PHPT are listed here and in Table 2.

Table 2
Clinical Features Useful in the Differential Diagnosis Between Benign and Malignant Primary Hyperparathyroidism *

Male sex: there is no sex preference, whereas the female:male ratio in PHPT favors women by a ratio of 3–4:1
Relatively young age: the average age of a patient with parathyroid cancer is 50 yr, about 10 yr younger than the usual patient with benign PHPT.
Markedly elevated serum calcium and PTH: Serum calcium levels are within 1 mg/dl above the upper normal limit in most patients with parathyroid adenomas and > 14–15 mg/dl in most patients with parathyroid carcinoma. PTH levels are markedly elevated in patients with parathyroid carcinoma and only slightly elevated in those with adenomas.
Bone and renal involvement: the combination of both renal and bone manifestations at the time of presentation suggests the possibility of parathyroid carcinoma. In benign PHPT, overt bone disease is unusual, and concomitant skeletal and renal involvement is uncommon.
Size and appearance of the parathyroid lesion: parathyroid carcinomas are usually > 3 cm and may be palpable. The tissue is hard and gray-white and adherent to adjacent structures. Parathyroid adenomas are smaller, dark brown, and firm but not hard.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Patients in whom the localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

### Intrathyroidal parathyroid adenomas: scoping review on clinical presentation, preoperative localization, and surgical treatment [^111Eq2w5]. Head & Neck (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The aim of this review is to map the current literature on intrathyroid parathyroid adenomas, focusing on areas of clinical importance (e.g. imaging, surgical considerations) and highlighting gaps for further research. Due to the varied nature of the categories of information collected (Table 1), a scoping review was deemed best suited for this approach.

4.1 Clinical presentation

Studies that reported clinical symptoms for IPAs tended to focus on the type of symptom without commenting on the severity of each symptom. Due to delays in diagnosing ectopic parathyroid adenomas, patients with these variants can present with progressive symptoms of hypercalcemia, such as severe bone disease. Future studies should consider noting the extent of PHPT features in those with IPAs (e.g. recording the frequency of kidney stones, as opposed to the presence of this feature alone).

4.2 Localization techniques

Current imaging modalities available to localize IPAs range from ultrasound to selective venous sampling. This review also introduces emerging techniques including autofluorescence. Imaging features of IPAs, particularly on ultrasound, along with common differentials, are highlighted in Table 3.

Despite a systematic literature search, data on imaging features of IPAs, especially using modalities such as 4D‐CT, 11 C‐Met PET/CT, SVS, and MRI are sparse. Further studies using larger sample sizes will be required to determine unique features and to discern sensitivities and specificities. This will be useful in informing the order of imaging tests to accurately localize IPAs. Due to the rarity of this variant, multicenter studies combining IPA cohorts might be required to achieve this goal.

Many studies using MRI and CT report very low accuracies. However, this is difficult to interpret due to small sample sizes. Additionally, these modalities are often reserved for difficult cases where first‐line imaging with ultrasound +/− sestamibi is inconclusive, introducing a selection bias. In practice, imaging results from CT/ MRI are often interpreted in conjunction with results from techniques such as ultrasound. When used in combination, as is often the case in real‐world practice, they have a higher accuracy in detecting IPAs.

Due to small sample sizes that make it difficult to interpret reported sensitivities and specificities, future studies should also consider reporting imaging features of IPAs and comparing it to co‐existing pathology (e.g. thyroid nodules).

### Case report of a cystic parathyroidal adenoma with rapid growth induced by cinacalcet [^116JCh9o]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition of disease resulting from either hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid tissue. In our tertiary care center, we often see patients with parathyroid adenomas that are hard to localize, needing a comprehensive diagnostic approach. Cystic parathyroidal adenomas are a much rarer entity of this disease but have been described several times before. Also, giant volumes are reported and iPTH measurement in cystic fluid was found to be a useful method to confirm diagnosis.

Cinacalcet is a drug approved for the treatment of primary, secondary and malignant hyperparathyroidism. It decreases the release of parathormone through increasing sensitivity for calcium by allosteric modulation of the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid cells.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to parathyroid imaging, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- identification of abnormal parathyroid tissue is enhanced with SPECT in combination with CT and is particularly valuable in repeat surgical cases

- ultrasound and (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy continue to be useful localization tools, however, they can miss small adenomas and hyperplasia

- additional imaging or localization tools for patients failing surgery or suspected of having an ectopic parathyroid gland include CT, MRI, C-methionine PET/CT, parathyroid scintigraphy; obtain selective venous sampling only when required for remedial exploration.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism: historical and contemporary perspectives [^1117XBS1]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently diagnosed endocrine condition most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Our understanding of the epidemiology and management of PHPT have evolved in the past few decades. Asymptomatic PHPT has been the most common presentation in developed countries since the advent of routine biochemical screening. Symptomatic disease is now also decreasing in developing nations. Normocalcemic PHPT is a newer phenotype that can be diagnosed in the setting of elevated PTH concentrations with persistently normal serum calcium, however, evaluation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism is critical as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Genetic testing can be helpful in patients younger than 30 years of age and/or patients with intermediate or equivocal ranges of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (between 0.01 and 0.02) to differentiate PHPT from FHH and to evaluate for other genetic etiologies that may affect management. Surgery is the recommended treatment modality for symptomatic PHPT, and patients with asymptomatic PHPT meeting recommended criteria should also be considered for parathyroidectomy. "Asymptomatic" patients should be screened for the presence of nephrolithiasis and/or vertebral fracture, since many will be reclassified as having symptomatic disease with further investigation. For poor surgical candidates or patients not meeting criteria for surgery, medical therapy includes cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: effects on bone health [^114hAtxo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the most common cause of chronic hypercalcemia. With the advent of routine calcium screening, the classic presentation of renal and osseous symptoms has been largely replaced with mild, asymptomatic disease. In hypercalcemia caused by PHPT, serum parathyroid hormone levels are either high, or inappropriately normal. A single-gland adenoma is responsible for 80% of PHPT cases. Less frequent causes include 4-gland hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. Diminished bone mineral density and nephrolithiasis are the major current clinical sequelae. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for PHPT, and in experienced hands, cure rates approach 98%.

### Normal PTH levels in primary hyperparathyroidism: still the same disease? [^116L3aqH]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies have suggested that primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with only normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is a milder, less symptomatic form of pHPT. This study investigates symptoms, laboratory values, imaging, and outcomes of sporadic pHPT patients with normal PTH values.

Methods

We reviewed our prospectively collected database of 861 patients with sporadic pHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between December 1999 and June 2010. Patients with only normal PTH values for 6 months before surgery were compared to a randomized control group of sporadic pHPT patients with elevated PTH, matched 1:2 for age and gender.

Results

Fifty-eight (7%) patients had only normal PTH values within 6 months of surgery. The mean PTH was 55.1 pg/ml in the normal PTH group and 151.3 pg/ml in the control group (n = 116). There was no difference in preoperative calcium values, subjective symptoms, bone health, or the frequency of single-gland disease (SGD; 88% vs. 91%) between the two groups, but the normal PTH group had higher preoperative vitamin D values (30.8 vs. 21.4 ng/ml; P < 0.001), smaller adenomas (405 vs. 978 mg, P < 0.001), and more frequently underwent bilateral neck exploration (57% vs. 49%). There was a trend toward lower sensitivity of preoperative imaging in the normal PTH group.

Conclusions

Patients with pHPT and either elevated or normal PTH levels present with similar symptoms and calcium levels. The majority of patients with normal PTH have SGD, although adenomas are smaller. This may explain why patients with normal PTH values have less sensitive imaging and more frequently require four-gland exploration.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: a current perspective [^113wbRCh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) is one of the most common of all endocrine disorders. Eighty percent to 85% of cases are due to parathyroid adenomas while hyperplasia and carcinoma account for 10% to 15% and less than 1%, of cases, respectively. The past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of parathyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia. Additionally, imaging studies and the development of the intraoperative assay for parathyroid hormone have transformed the diagnosis and management of patients with these disorders.

Objective

To review the pathology of parathyroid lesions associated with P-HPT, their molecular and genetic bases, including heritable hyperparathyroidism syndromes, and their clinical diagnosis and management.

Data Sources

Review of pertinent epidemiology, pathology, radiology, and surgery literature on the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of P-HPT.

Conclusions

Although heritable causes of P-HPT including multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 and 2A and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome account for a minority of cases of P-HPT, advances in the characterization of the affected genes have provided insights into the genetic basis of sporadic parathyroid neoplasms. Alterations in cyclin D1 and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11q in adenomas and hyperplasias have provided support for clonality of these lesions. Parafibromin, the protein product of the HRPT2 gene responsible for hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, has been implicated in the development of sporadic parathyroid carcinomas and loss of immunohistochemical expression of this protein has been suggested to be of value in making the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma. Sestamibi scanning and ultrasound have revolutionized the planning of surgical approaches and the intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay has become the standard in guiding completion or extension of surgery.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed. The conclusions were then circulated to the participating professional societies.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) DNA sequence testing can be useful in familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; 4) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 5) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; and 6) the estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of kidney function in PHPT: an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min.1.73 m2 should be a benchmark for decisions about surgery in established asymptomatic PHPT.

### SNM practice guideline for parathyroid scintigraphy 4.0 [^113mbtPk]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2012). Medium credibility.

Parathyroid scintigraphy — documentation and reporting should include the indication, the procedure with dosage and route of radiopharmaceuticals and, if more than 1 radiopharmaceutical is used, the order and timing of administration, the timing of image acquisition, and whether imaging is planar or SPECT (or SPECT/CT). For planar imaging, projections and region imaged should be listed; for SPECT, the timing after injection and region imaged should be listed; and for CT, list kVp, mA, pitch, beam width, and scan length. Reports should also indicate which images demonstrated lesions, the location of findings, that a more precise localization may be possible with SPECT and SPECT/CT, any study limitations or confounding factors, and whether the patient underwent previous thyroidectomy. Interpretation wording should reflect diagnostic certainty, with example phrases "findings are most consistent with parathyroid adenoma" and "findings may represent an atypical scintigraphic appearance of parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia".

### Atypical parathyroid adenomas: challenging lesions in the differential diagnosis of endocrine tumors [^116pbiLR]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Atypical parathyroid adenomas represent a group of intermediate form of parathyroid neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential which show some atypical histological features that represent a challenge for the differential diagnosis with parathyroid carcinomas. They may occur as sporadic or as a part of hereditary syndromes. The molecular signature of these neoplasms is still unknown and the germline CDC73 mutations appears to be the most common anomaly in this setting suggesting that these cases might represent variants of the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. The identification of markers predicting the outcome is of great importance to guide an adequate postoperative monitoring and, the same time, relieve of the anxiety of relatively strict monitoring patients not at risk. This review will summarize the current knowledge of the clinical, biochemical, molecular and histological profile of atypical parathyroid adenomas.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114cXnqP]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with parathyroid carcinoma, AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to establish the histologic diagnosis of parathyroid cancer based on the identification of unequivocal angioinvasion and consider assisting it with biomarkers.

### The EANM practice guidelines for parathyroid imaging [^114fSTWM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Another issue is discussed in a recent article regarding the lack of specific criteria for the diagnosis of minimally invasive parathyroid carcinoma. It appears to be less aggressive compared with "classic" parathyroid carcinoma and authors suggest the importance of differentiating it from parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid carcinoma.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^117RqHLn]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with parathyroid carcinoma, AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to suspect parathyroid cancer in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with markedly elevated PTH and severe hypercalcemia.
