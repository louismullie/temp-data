## Question

GFR 103 meaning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this value is measured or estimated and why that matters. Then, I should verify the units and indexing to body surface area. Next, I will compare 103 to population reference ranges and CKD GFR categories. After that, I need to consider age, sex, and population-specific adjustments. Finally, I should review limitations of estimation and outline practical next steps, including when to confirm with cystatin C or measured GFR.

> Let me first confirm the basics: GFR stands for glomerular filtration rate, and a value of 103 is almost certainly reported in mL/min/1.73 m², which indexes kidney function to a standard body surface area of 1.73 m² to allow fair comparisons across individuals of different sizes. I should double-check that the lab report indeed uses this unit, because misinterpretation can occur if non-indexed units are used inadvertently [^1168yqgH] [^116g7Jhc].

> Now, I need to check whether this 103 is a measured GFR (mGFR) or an estimated GFR (eGFR). Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most routine results are eGFR derived from serum creatinine using CKD-EPI or similar equations, and eGFR has inherent uncertainty compared with mGFR, especially at higher GFR levels. If accuracy is critical for decisions, confirmatory testing with cystatin C or measured GFR is advised [^117KYqnD] [^1158bsBB] [^117PWaEL].

> Next, I should review how 103 fits into CKD GFR categories. By KDIGO, GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² is category G1 ("normal or high"), and 60–89 is G2 ("mildly decreased"). So 103 falls squarely in G1, and in the absence of markers of kidney damage such as albuminuria, this does not meet criteria for chronic kidney disease. Wait, let me verify the damage component — yes, CKD requires either GFR < 60 for at least 3 months or evidence of kidney damage, so 103 alone is not CKD [^114KtcHN] [^115J1FKD] [^112d2rcg].

> I will now examine population context. In healthy adults, measured GFR commonly averages around 100–110 mL/min/1.73 m², with a typical 2.5–97.5 percentile range roughly 76–137. For example, in a West African cohort the mean mGFR was 103 with 2.5th–97.5th percentiles of 76–137, and in a Brazilian cohort the mean was about 106 with a range of 67–153. So 103 sits at or near the population mean, suggesting normal excretory kidney function in this context [^114NM3To] [^113dvMQu] [^115ruxUN].

> But wait, what if the patient is very young or older? I need to ensure I account for age. GFR physiologically declines with age, and a value of 103 may be average for someone in their 30s–50s yet above average for someone older and below average for someone in their 20s. Equations that model GFR often include age terms, and some incorporate a quadratic age effect to better fit the senescent decline, so I should interpret 103 in light of the patient's age and trajectory rather than a fixed cutoff [^115zwMt3] [^113dvMQu].

> Hold on, I should verify sex and population-specific considerations. After adjusting for body size, mean GFR differences between men and women are modest in many cohorts, though muscle mass and assay characteristics can influence creatinine-based eGFR. In some populations, such as lean African adults, standard equations may overestimate GFR unless race coefficients are omitted, reinforcing the need to consider the equation used and the patient's phenotype when interpreting 103 [^115ruxUN] [^113X3GpT] [^113Twakv].

> I need to check for potential estimation error. At higher GFR levels, eGFR is less precise, with about 10% of estimates deviating by more than 30% from mGFR; non-GFR determinants of creatinine (diet, muscle mass, tubular secretion) and analytical variability contribute. If the clinical stakes are high — such as dosing narrow-therapeutic-index drugs, evaluating kidney donors, or resolving discordant results — confirmatory cystatin C–based eGFR or measured GFR should be considered [^113HUxMh] [^112x7Nwn] [^1158bsBB].

> Let me consider next steps. If this 103 is an initial eGFRcr and there is no albuminuria or other kidney damage marker, no immediate action is required beyond routine care. If there are risk factors or discordant clinical findings, I should confirm with eGFRcr-cys or mGFR. If the value is already mGFR, then 103 is a direct, reliable index of filtration and again indicates normal function absent damage markers. I should also document the equation used and, if relevant, the absence of albuminuria to avoid misclassification [^117KYqnD] [^116g7Jhc] [^115J1FKD].

> In summary, a GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² generally indicates normal glomerular filtration rate and, by itself, does not indicate chronic kidney disease. Interpretation should be contextualized by whether the value is measured or estimated, the patient's age and population, and the presence or absence of kidney damage markers, with confirmatory testing reserved for situations where greater accuracy will change management [^114KtcHN] [^117PWaEL] [^1158bsBB].

A GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² means the kidneys are filtering blood at a **normal rate** for a healthy adult, indicating no kidney dysfunction [^115J1FKD]. This value falls within the **normal range** (≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) and, in the absence of other kidney damage markers, does not meet criteria for chronic kidney disease [^112d2rcg]. GFR naturally declines with age, so 103 is typical for younger adults and may be above average in older individuals [^115zwMt3]. No specific action is needed, but routine monitoring is reasonable if risk factors are present [^1151FXzp].

---

## Clinical significance of GFR 103

- **Normal kidney function**: A GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates normal kidney function, meaning the kidneys are effectively filtering waste products and excess fluids from the blood [^115J1FKD].

- **Absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: According to KDIGO guidelines, CKD is diagnosed when GFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for at least three months or when there is evidence of kidney damage (such as albuminuria) [^115vbyon]. Therefore, a GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m², in the absence of other kidney damage markers, does not indicate CKD [^115J1FKD].

- **Age-related considerations**: GFR typically declines with age, so a value of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² may be considered above average for older adults, while it is within the normal range for younger individuals [^115zwMt3].

---

## Factors influencing GFR values

Several factors can influence **GFR values**, including:

| **Factor** | **Effect on gfr** |
|-|-|
| Age | GFR naturally declines with age [^115zwMt3] |
| Sex | Males generally have slightly higher GFR than females [^notfound] |
| Body size | Larger individuals may have higher GFR |
| Hydration status | Dehydration can temporarily lower GFR |
| Medications | Certain drugs can affect GFR measurements [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **No immediate intervention required**: A GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² does not require any immediate medical intervention or lifestyle changes.

- **Routine monitoring**: Regular monitoring of kidney function is recommended, especially for individuals with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease [^1151FXzp].

- **Healthy lifestyle**: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including adequate hydration, balanced diet, and regular exercise, supports optimal kidney function.

---

## Limitations of GFR measurement

It is important to note that **GFR is often estimated** using equations based on serum creatinine levels, age, sex, and other factors, which may introduce some variability [^117AShmo]. Measured GFR (mGFR) using exogenous markers is more accurate but is not routinely performed due to logistical constraints [^111AS4ZM].

---

A GFR of 103 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates **normal kidney function** and does not suggest kidney disease. Regular monitoring and a healthy lifestyle are advisable to maintain optimal kidney health.

### Measured (and estimated) glomerular filtration rate: reference values in west Africa [^114NM3To]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Establishment of normal reference values for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is mandatory in nephrology. However, no data are available for measured GFR (mGFR) in Africa.

Methods

GFR was measured in 237 healthy adult subjects (103 women and 134 men, mean age 34 ± 10years) by iohexol plasma clearance.

Results

The mean mGFR was 103 ± 17mL/min/1.73 m² and the median value was 103mL/min/1.73 m² (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles are 76 and 137mL/min/1.73 m², respectively). No significant difference in mGFR results was observed in patients < 40years of age, whereas a significant decline in mGFR was observed after 40years of age. There was no significant difference between mGFR in men and women.

Conclusions

Normal GFR values and descriptions of percentiles are now available for West Africa. As in Caucasians, no significant difference was observed between men and women. Moreover, the same age-associated decline in mGFR is also observed after 40years of age, as in Caucasians.

All methods used to measure and estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are associated with systematic or random error, which leads to differences in measured GFR (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR) from "true GFR". In this issue of Kidney International, Rowe et al. evaluate time-to-time variability using repeated assessments of mGFR and eGFR within a short time frame. They show that biological variability is larger for mGFR than eGFR, and the magnitude of reference change values when interpreting changes in mGFR and eGFR.

To assess the potential relation between GFR and gender, the 123 male subjects were compared to the 162 female participants. Men and women were matched by age (40 ± 14 vs. 41 ± 13 years, P = 0.66); BMI (25 ± 3 vs. 25 ± 4 kg/m², P = 0.13), and ethnicity (93% vs. 94% white, P = 0.81), respectively. As expected, BSA was greater in men (1.9 ± 0.16 vs. 1.7 ± 0.15 m², P < 0.001). After adjusting for BSA, the mean GFR was similar in men and women (108 ± 18 vs.104 ± 18 mL/min/1.73 m² respectively, P = 0.13). The inverse correlation observed between GFR and age was similar for men and women (r = −0.45 and −0.33 respectively, P = 0.243). Simple linear regression analysis confirmed that gender did not influence GFR (r² = −0.002; P = 0.47). Accordingly, multiple linear regression was performed with GFR as the dependent variable, and age and gender simultaneously as independent variables, yielding an r 2 of 0.15, P < 0.001 for age only. On comparison between the 93 women and 72 men aged < 45 years, there was no significant difference between GFRs (111 ± 18 vs. 113 ± 18 respectively, P = 0.51). Comparison between the 69 women and 51 men aged > 45 years, however, showed a trend toward lower GFRs in the female group (96 ± 14 vs. 101 ± 16, P = 0.08).

### Refining GFR estimation: a quest for the unobservable truth? [^115D3Jas]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is central to evaluating kidney health, remains challenging. Measured GFR is not widely available and lacks standardization. Estimated GFR can be highly inaccurate for some patients and has limited applicability to many patient populations, such as those who are acutely ill. Recent metabolomic advances show promise for identifying new filtration markers that might enhance GFR estimation. Improving GFR assessment will require refinement in both GFR measurement and estimation methods.

Results

Two hundred and eighty-five healthy adults, 162 (57%) women, 266 (93%) white, 19 (7%) black, aged 41 ± 13 years (range, 19–70 years), BMI 25 ± 3 kg/m 2, were evaluated (Table 1). Overall, the GFR measured by 51 Cr-EDTA clearance (51 Cr-GFR) was 106 ± 18 mL/min/1.73 m² (range, 67 to 153 mL/min/1.73 m²), with a Gaussian distribution.

*Self-reported.

There was a significant inverse correlation between age and GFR (r = −0.33, P < 0.001). Simple linear regression analysis confirmed the influence of age on GFR (r 2 = 0.11, P < 0.001). After stratifying data by age decades, we found that GFR starts to decline significantly after 45 years of age (Figure 1). We compared the slope of the GFR regression equation (y = a + b×x) in subjects younger than 45 (GFR = 103.4 + 0.26 × age) vs. older than 45 years of age (GFR = 136.4–0.72 × age). The slope of younger subjects was not different from zero (one sample t test, P = 0.169), whereas the slope of the older group was consistent with a significant decrease in GFR (P = 0.003). Reference GFR values (mean ± 2 SD) were calculated, ranging from 76 to 148 mL/min/1.73 m² for individuals aged < 45 years and 68 to 128 mL/min/1.73 m² for subjects older than 45 years. These values are depicted in Figure 2.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis and screening — KDIGO recognizes that the threshold glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² (GFR categories G3a–G5) for > 3 months to indicate a diagnosis of CKD is well below the average in young adult men and women, and it notes an average age-associated GFR decline with risk of adverse outcomes for a given GFR that may be comparatively lower in individuals aged > 65 years without albuminuria or other markers of kidney damage than in younger people. Prevention and screening for CKD should be a health care priority, mostly by healthcare providers in primary care and other specialties, and screening efforts should include assessments of GFR (estimated or in certain situations measured) and albuminuria; we strongly support efforts aimed at early detection and treatment among people at high risk, including those with hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The CGA classification of CKD is based on cause, level of kidney function determined by GFR, and degree of albuminuria, and higher specific stages or categories characterized by GFR and albuminuria independently portend greater relative risk (RR) for adverse outcomes.

### Reporting the eGFR and its implication for CKD diagnosis [^1164PVLh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The process of diagnosing chronic kidney disease using the estimated GFR involves several pitfalls. The estimated GFR laboratory report should be requested only by practitioners who are familiar with how to interpret the result. Until a more reliable method is available to estimate the GFR, the current chronic kidney disease classification should be revised by reducing the central role of the GFR cutoff levels.

### Determining the glomerular filtration rate-an overview [^114UEkAB]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Correct determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as an indicator of kidney function bears great importance because clinical decision-making depends on it at many occasions. During the last years, a huge body of literature has been published on estimation and measurement of GFR. The increasing pace with which novel estimation formulae, current and newer biomarkers, assay standardization procedures as well as invasive measurement methods of GFR were published, has been overwhelming for many clinicians. This concise review summarizes central issues in determining kidney function by listing some of the most important publications. It explains fundamental principles in GFR estimation and measurement, the influence of clinical characteristics on endogenous biomarkers, and obstacles in biomarker assessment. Thus, it is thought to be a guide for clinicians through the confusing jungle of GFR determination.

Selection of GFR estimating equations — use of validated eGFR: We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum filtration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum filtration markers alone (1D). Practice Point 1.2.4.1 advises to use the same equation within geographical regions (as defined locally [e.g., continent, country, and region] and as large as possible), noting that within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. The recommendation places a high value on using an estimating equation validated in the population of interest, and the key points are to use an equation validated and most suited to the population of interest; there is potential for harm if people get different eGFR values when receiving care in different settings, and there is benefit to clinical care, research, and public health with the use of validated equations such that decisions, research findings, and public policy are informed by accurate estimates of CKD.

Selection of GFR estimating equations — We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum filtration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum filtration markers alone (1D). Use the same equation within geographical regions (as defined locally [e.g., continent, country, and region] and as large as possible); within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. This recommendation recognizes that there are now a number of validated GFR estimating equations available and places a high value on the use of an estimating equation for GFR that has been validated in the population of interest and which has been shown to be most accurate in comparison with mGFR. There is potential for harm if people get different eGFR values when receiving care in different settings, and using the same equation within the same geographical region can eliminate the source of variation that is related to the specific parameters of the GFR estimating equation. There is benefit to clinical care, research, and public health with the use of validated equations such that decisions, research findings, and public policy are informed by accurate estimates of CKD. Certainty of evidence: This recommendation is based on Work Group consensus regarding good clinical practice to use a GFR estimating equation validated in the population of interest.

### Cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: does it apply to all patients? [^115xffvU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Bubble size is proportional to number of patients. T2D, type 2 diabetes

Renal health at baseline is also an important consideration when assessing the relevance of CVOT results in clinical practice. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; measured as mL/min/1.73 m 2 of body surface area) for most CVOTs was > 70, and 85.2 for DECLARE‐TIMI 58. Only CREDENCE 36 and CARMELINA 40 had a mean eGFR of < 60; these two trials were designed to assess the impact of canagliflozin and linagliptin, respectively, specifically in patients with reduced renal health. However, study comparisons should take into account patient distribution as well as mean values; differences include variation in eGFR categories across the SGLT2 inhibitors trials, including no patients with an eGFR of < 45 in DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (Table 1).

TABLE 1

As expected, the baseline risk of CV outcomes is the key driver of absolute event rates in the different CVOTs. The placebo arm event rates for all outcomes were notably lower in the CV‐renal healthy DECLARE‐TIMI 58 population compared with those in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME and CANVAS (Table 2). However, the baseline risk profile also seems to influence the observed relative risk, with the highest relative risk reductions reported in the SGLT2 inhibitor trials with the highest proportion of patients at high CV risk. 11, 33

KDIGO 2024 CKD — estimated GFR versus measured GFR characteristics — The table contrasts estimated GFR using serum creatinine and/or cystatin C with measured GFR: estimated approaches are "Inexpensive and easy to implement", "Widely available and may also be used at point of care, easily repeatable", yet are "Not sufficiently accurate and precise for all clinical situations", "Lags behind changes in GFR", and are "Subject to non-GFR determinant confounding". Measured GFR is "More expensive, more time-consuming, and invasive", with "Methods to measure that do not require urine collections are available (i.e., plasma clearance)" but "Most protocols require repeat blood samples potentially over a long duration", and although "Microsampling tests by fingerprick enable point-of-care testing. Testing has been described, but not routinely performed", measured GFR is "Accurate for GFR in all situations and across the GFR range. Requires individualized protocols", is "Able to identify early changes in GFR", and is "Less influenced by non-GFR determinants".

Table 13 — Criteria for a validated GFR estimating equation include being developed using rigorous measured GFR (mGFR) methods; ideally using comparable measurements for all individuals in the development populations, using assays for filtration markers traceable to reference materials with acceptable accuracy and imprecision, and having a sufficient sample size for the population; study populations should include a wide range of clinical characteristics and GFR, where possible representative of the clinical populations in which equations are to be applied, including representative samples of general population and people with kidney disease; accuracy should be evaluated against mGFR in separate populations from that in which the equation was developed (external validation) with thresholds for performance compared with other equations; and equations should be implementable by clinical laboratories, meaning they can be reported without other variables not readily available.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate: is it good enough? And is it time to move on? [^114tXwSF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue.

Recent Findings

Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein) against some external metric of kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior, which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard'.
Summary

Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of diminishing returns.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Special considerations for GFR estimation note uncertainty and tailored approaches. It is unclear how best to estimate GFR in people who are transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary, where a person's gender identity is different from their sex assigned at birth. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is associated with an increase in SCr concentration, with less certainty for the impact of estrogen; gender-affirming testosterone therapy is associated with an increase in serum cystatin C and gender-affirming estrogen therapy, and antiandrogen therapy is associated with a decrease in serum cystatin C, and the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy, if any, on true GFR is unknown. In keeping with guidance from the American Association of Clinical Chemistry and the National Kidney Foundation, evaluation of eGFR should use a shared decision-making approach with the person with CKD, taking into account muscle mass, sex hormone milieu, sex assigned at birth, and gender identity, and the new EKFC cystatin equations do not include a variable for sex. Pediatric considerations state there are currently insufficient externally validated data to assess if combining creatinine and cystatin improves the performance of pediatric eGFR equations.

### Lower estimated GFR and higher albuminuria are associated with adverse kidney outcomes. A collaborative meta-analysis of general and high-risk population cohorts [^1142Ntcx]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Both a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria are known risk factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To determine their joint contribution to ESRD and other kidney outcomes, we performed a meta-analysis of nine general population cohorts with 845,125 participants and an additional eight cohorts with 173,892 patients, the latter selected because of their high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the general population, the risk for ESRD was unrelated to eGFR at values between 75 and 105 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) but increased exponentially at lower levels. Hazard ratios for eGFRs averaging 60, 45, and 15 were 4, 29, and 454, respectively, compared with an eGFR of 95, after adjustment for albuminuria and cardiovascular risk factors. Log albuminuria was linearly associated with log ESRD risk without thresholds. Adjusted hazard ratios at albumin-to-creatinine ratios of 30, 300, and 1000 mg/g were 5, 13, and 28, respectively, compared with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 5. Albuminuria and eGFR were associated with ESRD, without evidence for multiplicative interaction. Similar associations were found for acute kidney injury and progressive CKD. In high-risk cohorts, the findings were generally comparable. Thus, lower eGFR and higher albuminuria are risk factors for ESRD, acute kidney injury and progressive CKD in both general and high-risk populations, independent of each other and of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Measurement and estimation of GFR for use in clinical practice: core curriculum 2021 [^111NHckj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is fundamental to clinical practice, public health, and research. The kidney has several critical functions; GFR is used as an overall assessment of these kidney functions. GFR is used to diagnose, stage, and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD); ascertain the prognosis for chronic kidney disease-related events and mortality; and determine drug dosages. GFR is the rate at which the glomerulus filters plasma to produce an ultrafiltrate and can be assessed from clearance or serum levels of filtration markers. Clearance measurements using exogenous filtration markers are difficult to perform in routine clinical practice, so GFR is more commonly estimated through equations based on serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers, most commonly creatinine. These GFR estimates are reasonably accurate, but optimal care for patients may require a confirmatory test for a more accurate GFR assessment. Confirmatory tests currently available include cystatin C-based equations, urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers, or urinary clearance of creatinine. Appreciation of the concept of GFR and methods for optimal assessment in routine practice or special circumstances, and their strengths and limitations, are critical in making judicious use of the available tools.

Evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Practice Point 1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and because treatments for CKD provide benefits in reducing risk for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD progression, strategies that promote early detection of CKD should improve kidney and non–kidney-related outcomes. Knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD, and initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria. Interviews with people who have CKD have provided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if they received a diagnosis of CKD, and if a familial form of kidney disease is suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person may allow detection in other family members.

### The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO controversies conference report [^114cAf7s]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

### Chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation pronouncedly underestimates glomerular filtration rate in type 2 diabetes [^112bmwnr]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the performance of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in type 2 diabetic patients with GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This was a cross-sectional study including 105 type 2 diabetic patients. GFR was measured by 51 Cr-EDTA method and estimated by the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations. Serum creatinine was measured by the traceable Jaffe method. Bland-Altman plots were used. Bias, accuracy (P30), and precision were evaluated.

RESULTS

The mean age of patients was 57 ± 8 years; 53 (50%) were men and 90 (86%) were white. Forty-six (44%) patients had microalbuminuria, and 14 (13%) had macroalbuminuria. 51 Cr-EDTA GFR was 103 ± 23, CKD-EPI GFR was 83 ± 15, and MDRD-GFR was 78 ± 17 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P < 0.001). Accuracy (95% CI) was 67% (58–74) for CKD-EPI and 64% (56–75) for MDRD. Precision was 21 and 22, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS

The CKD-EPI and MDRD equations pronouncedly underestimated GFR in type 2 diabetic patients.

RESULTS

This cross-sectional study included 105 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Their mean age was 57 ± 8 years (42–86); 53 (50%) were men, and 90 (86%) were white. Forty-six (44%) had microalbuminuria, and 14 (13%) had macroalbuminuria. Plasma glucose was 148 ± 28 mg/dL, and A1C was 8.3 ± 0.3%.

51 Cr-EDTA GFR was 103 ± 23, CKD-EPI GFR was 83 ± 15, and MDRD GFR was 78 ± 17 mL/min/1.73 m² (P < 0.001). According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes GFR classification, 75% of the patients in our study were stage 1 (GFR > 90 mL/min), and 25% were stage 2 (GFR = 60–89 mL/min) as measured by 51 Cr-EDTA GFR. Misclassification to stage 3a (GFR = 45–59 mL/min) occurred in 7.6 and 9.5% of the cases using the CKD-EPI and MDRD equations, respectively.

Figure 1 shows the plots of measured and estimated GFR values. The CKD-EPI and MDRD equations systematically underestimated measured GFR. Bias was 20 and 24 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for CKD-EPI and MDRD, respectively (P = 0.26). Bias was significantly greater in subjects with GFR above versus below the median value (30 vs. 9 for CKD-EPI and 34 vs. 14 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for MDRD [P < 0.001 for each pair of comparisons]). Accuracy P30 (95% CI) was 67% (58–74) for CKD-EPI and 64% (56–75) for MDRD. Precision was 21 and 22, respectively.

### Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate: current status and future directions [^117PWaEL]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the assessment of kidney function in medical practice, research and public health. Measured GFR (mGFR) remains the reference standard, but the past 20 years have seen major advances in estimated GFR (eGFR). Both eGFR and mGFR are associated with error compared with true GFR. eGFR is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines, regulatory agencies and public health agencies for the initial evaluation of GFR, with measured GFR (mGFR) typically considered an important confirmatory test, depending on how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for application to the clinical, research or public health setting. Our approach is to use initial and confirmatory tests as needed to develop a final assessment of true GFR. We suggest that GFR evaluation might be improved by more complete implementation of current recommendations and by further research to improve the accuracy of mGFR and eGFR.

### What should European nephrology do with the new CKD-EPI equation? [^111zy4Yi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

ARGUMENTS FAVORING AND OPPOSING CHANGING THE CKD-EPI EQUATION

Given the presently available data, the question is now what European nephrology should do with the new 2021 CKD-EPI equation — should it be adopted or ignored?

There are compelling arguments to adopt it. We suggest that nephrology use the same language, definitions and equations across the globe. In 2019 KDIGO organized a Consensus Conference to make sure that we use uniform nomenclature to describe kidney function and disease. This helps effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community, and is instrumental to raise public awareness of the importance of CKD. We would also favor that nephrology across the globe uses the same equations to estimate GFR. It would be awkward if a different equation were to be used in the USA from that used in Europe. This would impact the prevalence of CKD differentially. When intervention trials are designed, the inclusion and exclusion criteria with respect to kidney function may become different in the USA versus Europe. These are all issues that should be avoided.

There are also convincing arguments against changing the CKD-EPI equation that is currently used in Europe. The first is that nearly all European countries do not use the race coefficient for the 2009 CKD-EPI equation. There is therefore no sense of urgency to change to the official race-free 2021 CKD-EPI equation. Another important reason is that the new equation does not perform better, but worse. Because GFR is overestimated in the larger part of the population, the overall CKD prevalence figures would decrease overnight. Also, the composition of the CKD population would change, since especially patients whom we previously thought of as high-risk patients are affected, i.e. males, elderly individuals, and subjects with a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Would this imply that epidemiological studies that showed that especially these subjects are at risk of developing CKD and its complications might have to be redone? In addition, how should the abrupt changes in eGFR induced by adopting a new equation be explained to patients, general practitioners and other medical specialists? On an individual level, the substantial reclassification to higher eGFR categories may also have unwanted implications for medication initiation, discontinuation and dosing, and financial coverage, and may lead to later nephrologist referral, planning for dialysis and evaluation for kidney transplantation.

### Impact of reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate: it's not just about us [^1161qxp8]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

The reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a key component of a public-health strategy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Jain and colleagues show that eGFR reporting in Ontario increased referrals to nephrologists by 23 consults per year, equivalent to 2.9 additional consults per 100,000 population. In our view, a complete assessment requires a broader perspective. Most patients with CKD do not require referral to a nephrologist. Improving outcomes requires coordinated efforts of all physicians.

### Impact of age on glomerular filtration estimates [^115zwMt3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular filtration decreases progressively with age in adults. Predictive equation should have proper modelling to adequately account for normal senescence.

Methods

Corrected 24-h creatinine clearances (CCLs) were measured in a cohort of 773 outpatients from 18 to 90 years old. Multiple linear regression was used to model the effect of age on glomerular filtration. Comparisons were made with the simplified MDRD and the MAYO equations. Impact of the derived equation was tested in a second cohort of 7551 patients with normal serum creatinine.

Results

While all equations show declining function with age, our results suggest that the GFR reduction is progressive after the age of 30 and continue to decline steadily after the age of 60. This leads to a convex curve in the multiple regression analysis that is best fitted by an equation including the quadratic term (age²). In contrast, the MDRD equation produces a faster decrease in early adulthood and a flatter curve after the age of 60 while the MAYO equation produces a more linear effect. MDRD results in the normal range are lower than those estimated by the MAYO equation. These equations, as applied on an independent cohort of 7551 normal outpatients from 18 to 102 years, produce different profile of evolution of GFR with age.

Conclusions

Inclusion of a quadratic term for age in the formula estimating GFR results in better modelling of the natural decline of renal function associated with ageing. Furthermore, as GFR steadily declines after the age of 30, a single cut-off value of GFR normality for all ages leads to underdiagnosis of young adults and over diagnosis of elderly individuals. Guidelines should take into account the observed reduction of kidney function with age in normal population for optimal evaluation of eGFR.

- of anticancer drugs whose dose is dependent on kidney function in specific clinical situations involving, but not limited to, patients with extremes of body size or muscle mass, amputees, persons with paraplegia or conditions of skeletal muscle.
2.2 eGFR CKD-EPI adjusted to an individual's body surface area (BSA) is not routinely advised to guide dosing of anticancer drugs over standardised eGFR CKD-EPI, except for carboplatin. Anticancer drug dosing based on weight descriptors (e.g. BSA, weight) may impact the performance of BSA-adjusted eGFR CKD-EPI to guide dosing, especially, as body size/composition will be accounted for twice in dose calculation.
2.3 BSA-adjusted eGFR CKD-EPI is a suitable alternative to directly measured GFR for use in the Calvert formula when dosing carboplatin, especially where eGFR CKD-EPI 45–125 mL/min/1.73 m², treatment intent is non-curative and the patient is neither an amputee, paraplegic or has conditions of skeletal muscle and is without extremes of body size or muscle mass. Directly measured GFR is the preferred kidney function value in other clinical situations.
2.4 When dosing anticancer drugs in the presence of reduced kidney function, carefully consider:

- Patient factors — clinical condition (e.g. hydration status, performance status), comorbidities (e.g. liver dysfunction), genetic polymorphisms (if applicable), factors influencing kidney function (e.g. presence of a single or horseshoe kidney, kidney transplant, dialysis) and attitude/beliefs towards treatment.
- Treatment factors — treatment protocol (e.g. intent of treatment, appropriate alternative treatment protocols with similar efficacy and without drugs dependent on kidney function for dosing), risk of adverse events (e.g. tumour lysis syndrome), anticancer drug properties (e.g. pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, formulation, availability of therapeutic drug monitoring), and concomitant drugs (especially with nephrotoxic potential).
- Other — accessibility to directly measured GFR, and the evidence and strength behind dose recommendations

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111gSNZi]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — eGFR uncertainty and laboratory measurement quality — eGFR is an imperfect estimate of measured GFR (mGFR), with the report stating, "At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% of mGFR". Uncertainty can be mitigated because "Optimization of laboratory measurements of creatinine and cystatin C can help to reduce the uncertainty inherent in GFR estimation", and laboratories must address "accuracy… imprecision… and specificity". Performance targets align to biologic variation since "Analytical variability that is less than half the within-person biological variability is generally considered desirable", and use of international reference standards for creatinine and cystatin C "help to ensure the accuracy of results".

Initial assessment with serum creatinine (SCr) — the guideline practice point states: "Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for the initial assessment of GFR". Evidence context notes that "There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of assessment of GFR", yet "For most clinical circumstances, estimating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging and monitoring the progression of CKD", and that "professional societies throughout the world have recommended that GFR estimates should be used in association with SCr reporting". The page cautions that "Sources of error in GFR estimation from SCr concentration include non–steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinine assays", and that "GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levels than at lower levels".

Operational and quality considerations for measured GFR: "All nephrologists ideally should therefore have access to at least 1 method to measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous markers". To ensure accuracy, "these clearance methods should be performed using standard operating procedures. External quality assessment (EQA) should be used for assays of the exogenous markers". Harmonization efforts are ongoing: the "European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) together with the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine is currently harmonizing mGFR protocols for iohexol plasma clearance to deliver standardized operating procedures for GFR measurements in the near future".

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^112NYCZ1]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium study design

The Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium studyincludes data from general population cohorts, cohorts at high risk of cardiovascular events, and cohorts with chronic kidney disease. These cohorts are described in appendices 1–3 on bmj.com. Eligible cohorts contained at least 1000 participants (except chronic kidney disease cohorts), outcomes of either mortality or end stage renal disease with a minimum of 50 events, and baseline information on estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Measures of albuminuria included the albumin-creatinine ratio (the preferred measure), protein-creatinine ratio, and qualitative measures using dipstick proteinuria. Adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were included.

Study covariates

The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration was used to estimate glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m². In general population and high risk cohorts, estimated glomerular filtration rate was categorised as < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–59, 60–74, 75–89, 90–104, or ≥ 105 mL/min/1.73 m², according to current clinical guidelines. Albuminuria was categorised as "negative", "high normal", "mild", or "heavy" depending on whether urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or urinary dipstick tests were available (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio < 10, 10–29, 30–299, ≥ 300 mg/g; dipstick proteinuria negative, trace, 1+, 2+ or more). These categories were adapted for chronic kidney disease cohorts to reflect the lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (categories < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–74, ≥ 75 mL/min/1.73 m²) and higher levels of albuminuria or proteinuria (albumin-creatinine ratio < 30, 30–299, 300–999, ≥ 1000 mg/g; protein-creatinine ratio < 50, 50–499, 500–1,499, ≥ 1,500 mg/g). To derive urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or protein-creatinine ratio in mg/mmol from the mg/g cut-off values, we divided them by 8.84. For ease of reading, we have omitted units for estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in the remainder of this manuscript.

Evaluation framework and when to add tests — an algorithm is described starting with creatinine-based eGFR and then deciding on supportive testing: "Figure 11 depicts an algorithm for evaluation of GFR from initial test using eGFRcr, followed by decisions for when to perform supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR". Clinicians are advised that "Healthcare providers should consider both potential sources of error in eGFR as well as whether the clinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR", and when needs exceed estimating equations, "mGFR should be performed". This judgment "would ideally be performed every time a GFR testing result is received".

### Assessment of GFR by four methods in adults in ashanti, Ghana: the need for an eGFR equation for lean African populations [^113X3GpT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background. Equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) have not been validated in Sub-Saharan African populations, and data on GFR are few.

Methods. GFR by creatinine clearance (Ccr) using 24-hour urine collections and estimated GFR (eGFR) using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4)[creatinine calibrated to isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) standard], Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and Cockcroft–Gault equations were obtained in Ghanaians aged 40–75. The population comprised 1013 inhabitants in 12 villages; 944 provided a serum creatinine and two 24-hour urines. The mean weight was 54.4 kg; mean body mass index was 21.1 kg/m².

Results. Mean GFR by Ccr was 84.1 ml/min/1.73 m²; 86.8% of participants had a GFR of ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m². Mean MDRD-4 eGFR was 102.3 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (difference v s. Ccr, 18.2: 95% CI: 16.8–19.5); when the factor for black race was omitted, the value (mean 84.6 ml/min/1.73 m 2) was close to Ccr. Mean CKD-EPI eGFR was 103.1 ml/min/1.73 m², and 89.4 ml/min/1.73 m² when the factor for race was omitted. The Cockcroft–Gault equation underestimated GFR compared with Ccr by 9.4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (CI: 8.3–10.6); particularly in older age groups. GFR by Ccr, and eGFR by MDRD-4, CKD-EPI and Cockcroft–Gault showed falls with age: MDRD-4 5.5, Ccr 7.7, CKD-EPI 8.8 and Cockcroft–Gault 11.0 ml/min/1.73 m²/10 years. The percentage of individuals identified with CKD stages 3–5 depended on the method used: MDRD-4 1.6% (7.2% without factor for black race; CKD-EPI 1.7% (4.7% without factor for black race), Ccr 13.2% and Cockcroft–Gault 21.0%.

Conclusions. Mean eGFR by both MDRD-4 and CKD-EPI was considerably higher than GFR by Ccr and Cockcroft–Gault, a difference that may be attributable to leanness. MDRD-4 appeared to underestimate the fall in GFR with age compared with the three other measurements; the fall with CKD-EPI without the adjustment for race was the closest to that of Ccr. An equation tailored specifically to the needs of the lean populations of Africa is urgently needed. For the present, the CKD-EPI equation without the adjustment for black race appears to be the most useful.

A graft transplanted between genetically nonidentical individuals; synonymous with transplant. 1 The 2009 CKD-EPI equation was a new glomerular filtration rate estimating equation, improving upon the MDRD equation. CKD-EPI stands for Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, a research group focused on developing glomerular filtration rate estimating equations. The 2009 CKD EPI equation is as follows: Scr is serum creatinine Min is the minimum of SCR/k and 1 Max is the maximum of SCR/k and 1 k = 0. 7 for females or
0. 9 for males α = -0. 241 for females or -0. 302 for males The 2021 CKD-EPI formula is a new estimate of glomerular filtration rate that does not include race. CKD-EPI stands for Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, a research group focused on developing glomerular filtration rate estimating equations. The 2021 CKD EPI equation is as follows: Male: 142 min-0. 302 max-1. 209
0. 9938Age. Female: 142 min-0. 241 max-1. 209
0. 9938Age * 1. 012 Scr is serum creatinine The metabolism of food in the body produces acids and bases of varying levels based on diet. The difference between the acids and bases is called the dietary acid load or formally, net endogenous acid production and must be buffered or excreted by the body through respiration or urination in order to maintain an acid-base balance. An equation used to estimate glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine and variables including age, gender, and race. Estimating equations are used to identify the stage of chronic kidney disease because serum creatinine levels alone cannot accurately reflect kidney function. MDRD equation: GFR = 175 × -1. 154 × -0. 203 × ×.

### What should European nephrology do with the new CKD-EPI equation? [^112CJws8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

To avoid the incorrect use of race as a biological construct and the resulting negative effect on health equity, the novel 2021 CKD-EPI equation was designed not to include a race coefficient. At present European nephrology in general uses the 2009 CKD-EPI equation to estimate kidney function for all subjects, without the Black race coefficient that this equation originally offered. From an ethical point of view changing from the 2009 to the 2021 CKD-EPI equation is therefore not felt to be an improvement. Since the 2021 CKD-EPI equation also seems to estimate GFR less accurately than the 2009 CKD-EPI equation, by overestimating GFR in the larger part of the European population, there is no strong evidence to adopt the new equation. European nephrology would do better to await novel developments to improve GFR estimation, such as adding anthropometrics to estimation equations, fundamentally changing these GFR equations or using/adding analytes other than creatinine as alternative filtration markers. When a significant improvement in accuracy and bias is achieved and validated independently, efforts should be made to reach global consensus before novel equations are implemented to replace the current ones.

GFR estimation for CKD staging in adults at risk — Recommendation 1.2.1.2 states: "In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimated from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B)". The rationale notes that "this recommendation puts a high value on data suggesting that the most accurate method of estimating GFR is by using 2 biomarkers (cystatin C and creatinine)", that "estimating equations using both creatinine and cystatin C afford greater accuracy in comparison with either filtration marker alone", and that "The recommendation places a lower value on the resource utilization and cost associated with the assessment of eGFRcr-cys".

Errors often arise from "non-GFR determinants of either creatinine or cystatin C"; for creatinine these include "generation by diet and muscle mass, tubular secretion, and extrarenal elimination", while for cystatin C they are "thought to be higher adiposity, smoking, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess, and chronic inflammation (as indicated by insulin resistance, higher levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, or lower levels of serum albumin)".

Chronic kidney disease — standardized estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting outlines laboratory practices for equation selection, documentation, units, and demographic inputs. The guideline states, "Laboratories should only use GFR estimating equations that have been sufficiently validated… and that are appropriate for the creatinine and cystatin C assays in use", ensure end-to-end reporting is "subject to regular EQA", and that reports "should indicate the filtration marker" with documentation of "which equation was used". For consistency, "a standardized approach in relation to reporting units of GFR, creatinine, and cystatin C should be implemented", and "Input age may be rounded to whole numbers or as a fractional year because the influence on eGFR is small". Regarding body size, "mGFR is commonly adjusted for body surface area (BSA), with a population average BSA value of 1.73 m2 being used", and "eGFR values derived using most equations are already adjusted for BSA". In electronic medical records (EMRs), "eGFR is mostly computed using the information recorded in the sex variable", and when sex/gender data are missing or nonbinary, "eGFR values cannot be computed and will be displayed as a missing value"; in such cases, "Laboratories should add a comment" directing users to online calculators and "The comment may also include a suggestion to use cystatin C… where there is an option for computing eGFR without the use of sex".

### The public health dimension of chronic kidney disease: what we have learnt over the past decade [^112kje8q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Much progress has been made in chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemiology in the last decade to establish CKD as a condition that is common, harmful and treatable. The introduction of the new equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the publication of international reference standards for creatinine and cystatin measurement paved the way for improved global estimates of CKD prevalence. The addition of albuminuria categories to the staging of CKD paved the way for research linking albuminuria and GFR to a wide range of renal and cardiovascular adverse outcomes. The advent of genome-wide association studies ushered in insights into genetic polymorphisms underpinning some types of CKD. Finally, a number of new randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have informed evidence-based guidelines for the treatment and prevention of CKD. In this review, we discuss the lessons learnt from epidemiological investigations of the staging, etiology, prevalence and prognosis of CKD between 2007 and 2016.

KDIGO 2024 — selection and implementation of GFR estimating equations note that using validated eGFR equations improves the accuracy assessment of true GFR but remains imperfect, and no single equation performs consistently across all populations; each region should have a mechanism for review and selection of equations for adoption by laboratories, which for most countries might be through the national kidney society with laboratory physician organizations or regional laboratory groups as has occurred in the United States and Europe; these continental and/or national decisions are likely to minimize small-area decisions that lead to variation in eGFR and uncertainty to people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and healthcare providers; if region-specific evaluation is not possible or in the interim, we advise using equations developed in populations most similar to the available populations, for example it may be reasonable to use CKD-EPI in countries within Central or South America and to use the EKFC equations using the Q-values, the median SCr concentration, in African countries based on a cohort developed in 2 African countries.

Despite limitations, "the Cockcroft-Gault equation continues to be one of the most commonly used eGFR methods for these people". In a comparative evaluation "against mGFR determined by plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA in 1200 people with solid tumors" the "eGFRcr (CKD-EPI) and the eGFRcr-cys (CKD-EPI) predicted mGFR with greater accuracy than Cockcroft-Gault". The text adds, "We advise that the same approach to GFR evaluation described in Section 1.2 be adopted in oncology practice and clinical trials", and that "BSA-adjusted eGFR may be indicated for selected specific situations like carboplatin dosing".

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^117B7E3v]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for more effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community. Despite this need for clarity, the nomenclature for describing kidney function and disease lacks uniformity. In June 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened a Consensus Conference with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in the English language to describe kidney function and disease, and of developing a glossary that could be used in scientific publications. Guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centered, precise, and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines. Conference attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations: (i) to use "kidney" rather than "renal" or "nephro-" when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use "kidney failure" with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment, rather than "end-stage kidney disease"; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), rather than alternative descriptions, to define and classify severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify severity of CKD; and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rather than "abnormal" or "reduced" kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function. A proposed 5-part glossary contains specific items for which there was general agreement. Conference attendees acknowledged limitations of the recommendations and glossary, but they considered standardization of scientific nomenclature to be essential for improving communication.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1134hRPd]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Risk assessment in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Monitoring should include to assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD, and to assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. Thresholds that exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation are a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing among those initiating hemodynamically active therapies, and for albuminuria monitoring a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test.

GFR assessment implementation standards using creatinine and cystatin C specify to report estimated GFR (eGFR) with validated equations, to report eGFR rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m² in adults using the units ml/min per 1.73 m², and that reported eGFR levels < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² should be flagged as being low. When reporting filtration markers, round serum creatinine (SCr) to the nearest whole number in μmol/l and to the nearest 100th of a whole number in mg/dl, and round serum cystatin C to the nearest 100th of a whole number in mg/l. Measure filtration markers using a specific, precise assay with coefficient of variation (CV) < 2.3% for creatinine and < 2.0% for cystatin C and with calibration traceable to international reference materials and desirable bias ≤ 3.7% for creatinine and ≤ 3.2% for cystatin C compared with reference methodology. Use an enzymatic method to assay creatinine, where possible, separate serum/plasma from red blood cells by centrifugation within 12 hours of venipuncture, and when cystatin C is measured, measure creatinine on the same sample to enable calculation of eGFRcr-cys.

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease-executive summary and glossary from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^115enW1f]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

A primary obligation of medical journals is the responsible, professional, and expeditious delivery of knowledge from researchers and practitioners to the wider community. The task of journal editors, therefore, rests not merely in selecting what to publish, but in large measure judging how it might best be communicated. The challenge of improving the descriptions of kidney function and disease in medical publishing was the impetus for a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference held in June 2019. The conference goals included standardizing and refining kidney-related nomenclature used in English language scientific articles and developing a glossary that could be used by journals.

While a glossary of kidney-related nomenclature is most applicable to kidney subspecialty journals, the interdependency of the kidney with other organ systems makes this glossary broadly relevant. For instance, accelerated atherosclerosis was quickly recognized as a complication in patients with kidney failure treated by maintenance haemodialysis, and guidelines have called attention to kidney disease as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease for > 20 years. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated the worldwide prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 2017 to be ∼697.5 million people (9.1% of the population), with 1.2 million deaths due to kidney failure, and an additional 1.4 million deaths due to cardiovascular disease (4.6% of total mortality). An earlier report concluded that, in 2013, 'Compared with metabolic risk factors, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranked below high systolic blood pressure, high body mass index, and high fasting plasma glucose, and similarly with high total cholesterol'.

KDIGO CKD nomenclature — chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria categories are specified as follows: CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for a minimum of 3 months with implications for health, and is classified based on Cause, GFR category (G1–G5), and Albuminuria category (A1–A3), abbreviated as CGA. GFR categories: G1 Normal or high ≥ 90; G2 Mildly decreased 60–89; G3a Mildly to moderately decreased 45–59; G3b Moderately to severely decreased 30–44; G4 Severely decreased 15–29; G5 Kidney failure < 15. Albuminuria categories: A1 Normal to mildly increased < 30 mg/g < 3 mg/mmol; A2 Moderately increased 30–300 mg/g 3–30 mg/mmol; A3 Severely increased > 300 mg/g > 30 mg/mmol. The color legend for prognosis indicates Green: low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no CKD); Yellow: moderately increased risk; Orange: high risk; Red: very high risk.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations in adults — MDRD Study and CKD-EPI — are summarized with key coefficients and conversion factors. For MDRD, "the coefficient of −1.154 for the exponent of Scr indicates that estimated GFR is 1.154% lower for each 1% higher Scr". For CKD-EPI, "the corresponding sex coefficients for the CKD-EPI Scr and Scr-Scys equations would be 0.75 and 0.83 for Scr values ≥ 0.9 mg/dL, respectively". A unit conversion is provided: "Conversion factor for Scr in mg/dL to mmol/L, ×88.4". Abbreviations on-page define terms: "GFR, glomerular filtration rate; Scr, serum creatinine (in mg/dL); Scys, serum cystatin C (in mg/dL)".

KDIGO 2024 — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation states to use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR, with creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr) as the initial test; if eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then, if available, cystatin C should be measured and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated, and if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers.

### Limitations of analyses based on achieved blood pressure: lessons from the African American study of kidney disease and hypertension trial [^113M6A6y]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) guidelines that set target BP levels often rely on analyses of achieved BP from hypertension treatment trials. The objective of this article was to compare the results of analyses of achieved BP to intention-to-treat analyses on renal disease progression. Participants (n = 1094) in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial were randomly assigned to either usual BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg or lower BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of ≤ 92 mm Hg. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by > 50% or > 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome. In contrast, the achieved BP analyses showed that each 10-mm Hg increment in mean follow-up achieved mean arterial pressure was associated with a 0.35 mL/min per 1.73 m² (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.62 mL/min per 1.73 m²; P = 0.01) faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline and a 17% (95% CI: 5% to 32%; P = 0.006) increased risk of the clinical composite outcome. Analyses based on achieved BP lead to markedly different inferences than traditional intention-to-treat analyses, attributed in part to confounding of achieved BP with comorbidities, disease severity, and adherence. Clinicians and policy makers should exercise caution when making treatment recommendations based on analyses relating outcomes to achieved BP.

Table 9 — Comparison of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by serum creatinine (SCr) and/or cystatin C versus measured GFR — eGFR is inexpensive and easy to implement and is widely available and may also be used at point of care, easily repeatable, but is not sufficiently accurate and precise for all clinical situations, lags behind changes in GFR, and is subject to non-GFR determinant confounding; measured GFR is more expensive, more time-consuming, and invasive, only available in certain centers, accurate for GFR in all situations and across the GFR range and requires individualized protocols, able to identify early changes in GFR, and less influenced by non-GFR determinants.

### Kidney disease, race, and GFR estimation [^1112owL2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of GFR is central to clinical practice, research, and public health. Current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend measurement of serum creatinine to estimate GFR as the initial step in GFR evaluation. Serum creatinine is influenced by creatinine metabolism as well as GFR; hence, all equations to estimate GFR from serum creatinine include surrogates for muscle mass, such as age, sex, race, height, or weight. The guideline-recommended equation in adults (the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation) includes a term for race (specified as black versus nonblack), which improves the accuracy of GFR estimation by accounting for differences in non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine by race in the study populations used to develop the equation. In that study, blacks had a 16% higher average measured GFR compared with nonblacks with the same age, sex, and serum creatinine. The reasons for this difference are only partly understood, and the use of race in GFR estimation has limitations. Some have proposed eliminating the race coefficient, but this would induce a systematic underestimation of measured GFR in blacks, with potential unintended consequences at the individual and population levels. We propose a more cautious approach that maintains and improves accuracy of GFR estimates and avoids disadvantaging any racial group. We suggest full disclosure of use of race in GFR estimation, accommodation of those who decline to identify their race, and shared decision making between health care providers and patients. We also suggest mindful use of cystatin C as a confirmatory test as well as clearance measurements. It would be preferable to avoid specification of race in GFR estimation if there was a superior, evidence-based substitute. The goal of future research should be to develop more accurate methods for GFR estimation that do not require use of race or other demographic characteristics.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the study population

The mean age was 45.3 years, similarly between men and women (p = 0.267), Table 1. Alcohol (68.9 vs. 37.8%), tobacco use (12.7 vs. 0.4%), and systolic blood pressure (137 vs. 128 mmHg) were higher in men compared to women (all p < 0.001). However, compared with men, women were more likely to have a history of hypertension (15.5 vs. 9.4%, p = 0.041), to have high body mass index (BMI, 28.6 vs. 25.8 kg/m8, p < 0.001)), and to be overweight or obese (68.2 vs. 53.6%, p = 0.001), Table 1. We observed a higher prevalence of CKD risk factors including hypertension (38.6%), overweight and obesity (60.4%), and longstanding use of herbal (57.8%) and street (29.6%) medicines in the study sample. As expected, serum creatinine was higher in men than women (p < 0.001) but women had a significantly higher mean estimated creatinine clearance by the CKD-EPI equation (103.5 vs. 95.5 ml/min, p = 0.005). Furthermore, estimated creatinine clearance was highest with CKD-EPI equation and lowest with the MDRD equation.

### EGFR conundrum: is this the "truth" or simply another "label"? [^1122EuFD]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Accurate assessment of true kidney function allows early identification, management, and prognostication of persons at risk of having kidney disease. Estimation of glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine-based equations is frequently used in clinical practice. The majority of these equations are developed in white populations, with very few that are specific to patients of Chinese ethnic backgrounds. This new study has developed a novel estimated glomerular filtration rate equation in a multicenter, multiethnic Chinese population.

Values and preferences, resource use, and implementation — Using validated eGFR equations improves the accuracy of assessment of true GFR but remains imperfect, and no single equation performs consistently across all populations; the Work Group judged that people with CKD and their healthcare providers would want GFR estimated using the equation providing the greatest accuracy in the population of their geographical region, and there are several valid equations that can reasonably be used in local settings. Each region should have a mechanism for review and selection of equations for implementation by laboratories, and decisions at this level by continental or national organizations are likely to minimize the likelihood that decisions for equation use will be made within small geographical areas governed by local decisions, leading to greater variation in eGFR and uncertainty by people with CKD and healthcare providers. There are likely to be tradeoffs between optimal accuracy in local regions versus uniformity; equations optimized for a specific region can help to ensure that the GFR thresholds for disease definition, classification, and risk estimation have the same implications across regions; however, it would lead to barriers to implementation, as it will not be possible for all regions to conduct a sufficiently large and representative study to evaluate these equations and develop modifications. If not possible, or in the interim, we advise using equations that were developed in populations most similar to the available populations. Resource use includes initial costs such as human resource costs and education for providers, which incurs both direct and indirect costs.
