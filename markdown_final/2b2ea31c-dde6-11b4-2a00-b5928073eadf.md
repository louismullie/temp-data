## Question

Which antibiotics need modifications in obese people

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics need dose modifications in obesity and how to adjust them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles that change in obesity. Then, I should verify which antibiotic classes consistently require modification and which do not. Next, I will examine class-specific evidence and guidelines, including aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and others. After that, I should consider special populations like pediatrics and pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight uncertainties where therapeutic drug monitoring or individualized decisions are warranted.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacokinetic issues in obesity. Obesity increases volume of distribution for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs due to greater adipose and lean mass, and it alters clearance, often increasing glomerular filtration and creatinine clearance, which can lead to augmented renal clearance and underexposure if not accounted for; protein binding may also be altered, and hepatic metabolism can be variable, though the clinical impact on antibiotics is less well defined [^117GZAbp] [^113HezKq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify which classes consistently require modification. The strongest evidence supports dose adjustments for aminoglycosides and glycopeptides, where obesity meaningfully changes distribution and clearance and underdosing is common if standard weight descriptors are used; in contrast, β-lactams generally show modest PK changes and do not mandate routine dose changes, though underexposure can occur in select contexts, and fluoroquinolones mostly do not require adjustment except for ciprofloxacin in some guidance [^117GZAbp] [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj].

> I will now examine aminoglycosides. I need to ensure I use the correct weight descriptor. Dosing should be based on adjusted body weight (ABW = IBW + 0.4 × excess weight) rather than total body weight to avoid overdosing, and once-daily regimens may be inappropriate in severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²); therapeutic drug monitoring is essential given the narrow therapeutic index and obesity-related PK variability [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj] [^116C4SFg] [^11536ixM].

> Next, I should review vancomycin. Wait, let me verify the loading and maintenance strategy. For serious infections, a loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg using actual body weight with a cap of 3,000 mg is recommended, followed by weight-based maintenance dosing with early and frequent AUC-guided monitoring; empiric total daily doses in obesity generally should not exceed 4,500 mg, and AUC targets of 400–600 are preferred over trough-only monitoring to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk [^112q8VKw] [^112q8VKw] [^115GrgBk] [^111vUNEN].

> Let me consider β-lactams carefully. I initially thought routine dose increases were broadly indicated, but wait, I should double-check the consensus. The most authoritative review concludes obesity produces only modest PK changes and does not support routine dose adjustments; however, underexposure can occur in critically ill patients or those with augmented renal clearance, and prolonged or extended infusion can improve pharmacodynamic target attainment in select scenarios, particularly for pathogens with higher MICs or in severe infections; case reports and small studies show increased Vd and altered clearance in morbid obesity, so if response is suboptimal, consider higher doses, more frequent administration, or extended infusion with PK/PD targets in mind [^117GZAbp] [^113xoNGZ] [^114o31JT] [^116aAFRj].

> I should confirm fluoroquinolone guidance. For ciprofloxacin, some public health guidance recommends dosing at the upper end of the range in obesity, whereas levofloxacin and moxifloxacin generally do not require adjustment; given limited and heterogeneous data, I need to ensure clinical judgment and MIC considerations guide dosing, and I should avoid extrapolating beyond the specific agents studied [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj] [^112yWaqK].

> Now, let me review other agents. Linezolid exposure appears comparable in obesity, so standard dosing is acceptable, though continuous infusion may be considered in severe pneumonia to optimize tissue concentrations; clindamycin PK normalized to total body weight is similar in obesity, so no routine adjustment is needed; daptomycin is dosed on actual body weight; for prophylactic cefazolin, evidence is mixed, but recent modeling and reviews suggest standard 2 g with redosing at 4 hours is sufficient for most obese patients, with some guidelines recommending 3 g if weight exceeds 120 kg, so I should individualize based on procedure, duration, and local protocols [^114a8ZWk] [^114Gpebb] [^1123rhtK] [^117Esg2n] [^111UUn3B] [^111ZuNB9].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or pregnant. I need to check pediatric specifics. For obese children, aminoglycosides can follow the same ABW principle, while vancomycin may require higher mg/kg doses in younger children and therapeutic monitoring is prudent; for adult obesity in pregnancy, obstetric guidance supports increased cefazolin prophylaxis doses in morbid obesity, reflecting altered tissue distribution and surgical site infection risk [^114B3UwN] [^111ZuNB9] [^1142g3Xj].

> Next, I should review practical implementation. I need to ensure loading doses are considered for hydrophilic agents in severe infection, that renal function is reassessed frequently because ARC is common in obesity and critical illness, and that TDM is used when available, especially for vancomycin and aminoglycosides; when using β-lactams in severe infections or with resistant pathogens, extended infusion can mitigate PK variability, though outcome data in obesity are limited and decisions should be individualized [^114Gpebb] [^113HezKq] [^113xoNGZ] [^114o31JT].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge uncertainties. Much of the obesity-specific PK literature is limited by small samples, heterogeneity, and lack of clinical outcome endpoints; the 2025 Lancet Infectious Diseases systematic review concludes that only aminoglycosides and glycopeptides have sufficient evidence to mandate obesity-specific dosing, while β-lactam adjustments remain contextual rather than universal, reinforcing the need for TDM and PK/PD target-guided strategies when response is suboptimal [^117GZAbp].

> In summary, I need to ensure my recommendations are precise: antibiotics that consistently require modification in obesity are aminoglycosides, using adjusted body weight with TDM, and vancomycin, using actual body weight for loading with AUC-guided monitoring; β-lactams generally do not require routine changes but may need higher doses, altered intervals, or extended infusion in critically ill patients or those with augmented renal clearance; ciprofloxacin may warrant upper-range dosing in some guidance, whereas levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, linezolid, and clindamycin typically do not; for prophylactic cefazolin, standard 2 g with 4-hour redosing is usually sufficient, though some guidelines advise 3 g if weight exceeds 120 kg, and all adjustments should be reassessed with clinical response and organ function in mind [^117GZAbp] [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj] [^114jPWFw] [^112q8VKw] [^115GrgBk] [^113xoNGZ] [^111ZuNB9].

---

In obesity, **aminoglycosides and vancomycin** require dose adjustments due to altered pharmacokinetics: use adjusted body weight (ABW = IBW + 0.4 × excess weight) for aminoglycosides [^116LgEU5] and base vancomycin on actual body weight with loading doses of 20–25 mg/kg (max 3 g) [^114jPWFw] and early AUC-guided monitoring [^115GrgBk]. β-lactams generally do not need routine adjustment [^117GZAbp], but **prolonged infusion** can improve target attainment in severe obesity or critical illness [^113xoNGZ] [^114o31JT]. Fluoroquinolones and clindamycin typically do not require adjustment, though ciprofloxacin may be dosed at the upper range in obesity [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj]. Always consider renal function, illness severity, and therapeutic drug monitoring to individualize dosing [^114Gpebb].

## Pharmacokinetic considerations in obesity

Obesity alters antibiotic pharmacokinetics via **increased volume of distribution (Vd)** — especially for hydrophilic drugs — and **altered clearance** from augmented renal function or hepatic changes [^117GZAbp] [^113HezKq]. These changes can cause underdosing or overdosing if not addressed [^116v99tV].

## Antibiotics requiring dose modification

Key characteristics of antibiotics requiring dose modification in obesity:

| **Aspect** | **Aminoglycosides** | **Vancomycin** |
|-|-|-|
| Rationale | Hydrophilic with narrow therapeutic index; obesity increases Vd and clearance, risking underdosing with total body weight (TBW) and toxicity with TBW [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj]. | Hydrophilic with complex PK in obesity; clearance and Vd are altered, necessitating weight-based dosing and monitoring [^114jPWFw] [^111vUNEN]. |
| Dosing strategy | Use adjusted body weight (ABW = IBW + 0.4 × excess weight) for initial dosing; monitor peak and trough to guide adjustments [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj] [^116C4SFg]. | Load 20–25 mg/kg actual body weight (max 3 g) [^114jPWFw]; use AUC-guided monitoring (target AUC/MIC 400–600) and adjust maintenance to keep AUC in range [^115GrgBk] [^111vUNEN]. |
| Clinical evidence | ABW improves target attainment and reduces toxicity compared with TBW or ideal body weight (IBW) [^116LgEU5] [^1141cA7N]. | AUC-guided dosing improves outcomes and reduces nephrotoxicity; loading doses are critical in obesity [^114jPWFw] [^111vUNEN]. |

---

## Antibiotics not requiring routine dose modification

Several antibiotics have **minimal PK changes in obesity** and generally do not require routine adjustment:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| β-lactams | - Cefazolin <br/> - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Meropenem | - Modest PK changes; no routine adjustment needed [^117GZAbp] <br/> - Prolonged infusion can improve target attainment in severe obesity or critical illness [^113xoNGZ] [^114o31JT] |
| Fluoroquinolones | - Levofloxacin <br/> - Moxifloxacin | - PK is relatively unchanged; no routine adjustment needed [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj] |
| Clindamycin | Clindamycin | - PK normalized to TBW is similar in obesity; no adjustment needed [^111hy6bx] [^1123rhtK] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal function**: Obesity increases GFR; use Cockcroft-Gault with ABW for aminoglycosides and vancomycin, and adjust for renal impairment as indicated [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj].
- **Critical illness**: Augmented renal clearance and fluid shifts increase underdosing risk; consider higher doses, prolonged infusion, and TDM for β-lactams and vancomycin [^114Gpebb] [^113HezKq].
- **Surgical prophylaxis**: Standard cefazolin 2 g suffices for most; some guidelines suggest 3 g if weight > 120 kg, but evidence is mixed and procedure-specific [^116NYi8E] [^111UUn3B] [^111ZuNB9].

---

## Clinical outcomes of inappropriate dosing

Inappropriate dosing in obesity leads to **increased treatment failure**, resistance, and toxicity. Underdosing is common in ED and ICU settings and correlates with worse outcomes [^116v99tV] [^115gweC9].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Aminoglycosides**: Dose by ABW; monitor peak/trough and adjust [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj].
- **Vancomycin**: Load 20–25 mg/kg (max 3 g); use AUC-guided monitoring and adjust maintenance [^114jPWFw] [^115GrgBk].
- **Β-lactams**: Use standard dosing; consider prolonged infusion and TDM in severe obesity or critical illness [^117GZAbp] [^113xoNGZ].
- **Fluoroquinolones and clindamycin**: Use standard dosing; no routine adjustment needed [^116LgEU5] [^1142g3Xj] [^111hy6bx].

---

In obesity, **aminoglycosides and vancomycin** require weight-based adjustments and monitoring, whereas β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin generally do not. Individualize dosing using renal function, illness severity, and TDM to optimize outcomes [^117GZAbp].

### The pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in patients with obesity: a systematic review and consensus guidelines for dose adjustments [^117GZAbp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Obesity can cause physiological changes resulting in antibiotic pharmacokinetic alterations and suboptimal drug exposures. This systematic review aimed to summarise the available evidence on this topic and provide guidance for dose adjustment of antibiotics in adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²). We searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases to find relevant studies published between database inception and Dec 30, 2023. We initially identified 6113 studies, which became 4654 studies after duplicate removal, and 128 studies were included in the final review. β-lactam antibiotics were most commonly studied (57 studies), followed by the group of glycopeptides, lipoglycopeptides, and oxazolidinones (45 studies). The certainty of evidence was low or very low for all antibiotics and a meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of study populations and methods. Obesity modestly alters the pharmacokinetics of β-lactam antibiotics, but evidence does not support routine dose adjustments. For aminoglycosides and glycopeptides, the impact of obesity on pharmacokinetics is evident and weight-based dosing is recommended. Data are sparse for other antibiotic classes and research needs are described. In the absence of robust pharmacokinetic data, therapeutic drug monitoring can be used to guide individualised dosing.

### Antibiotic therapy of pneumonia in the obese patient: dosing and delivery [^116BXVtV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity has been shown to be associated with antibiotic underdosing and treatment failure. This article reviews the recent literature on antibiotic dosing in obese patients with pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Obesity is associated with several alterations in antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including increases in the antibiotic volume of distribution and clearance. These alterations necessitate changes in the dosing of certain antibiotics. However, data on antibiotic dosing for pneumonia in obese patients are limited and come mainly from observational studies. Additionally, dosing recommendations are often extrapolated from healthy obese volunteers and from the studies of antibiotics given for other indications.

Summary

Recognizing obesity-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations is important in treating obese patients with pneumonia. Studies that evaluate such alterations and assess the impact of antibiotic dosing and delivery on the clinical outcomes of this patient population are needed.

### Antimicrobial dosing in specific populations and novel clinical methodologies: obesity [^112NfZ2k]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Obesity and its related comorbidities can negatively influence the outcomes of certain infectious diseases. Specific dosing recommendations are often lacking in the product label for patients with obesity that leads to unclear guidance in practice. Higher rates of therapeutic failure have been reported with some fixed dose antibiotics and pragmatic approaches to dose modification are limited for orally administered agents. For i.v. antimicrobials dosed on weight, alternate body size descriptors (ABSDs) have been used to reduce the risk of overdosing. These ABSDs are mathematical transformations of height and weight that represent fat-free weight and follow the same principles as body surface area (BSA)-based dosing of cancer chemotherapy. However, ABSDs are rarely studied in pivotal phase III studies and so can risk the underdosing of antimicrobials in patients with obesity when incorrectly applied in the real-world setting. Specific case examples are presented to highlight these risks. Although general principles may be considered by clinicians, a universal approach to dose modification in obesity is unlikely. Studies that can better distinguish human body phenotypes may help reduce our reliance on height and weight to define dosing. Simple and complex technologies exist to quantify individual body composition that could improve upon our current approach. Early evidence suggests that body composition parameters repurposed from medical imaging data may improve upon height and weight as covariates of drug clearance and distribution. Clinical trials that can integrate human body phenotyping may help us identify new approaches to optimal dose selection of antimicrobials in patients with obesity.

CONCLUSION

Obese patients with pneumonia may be incorrectly dosed when obesity-related pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics alterations are not recognized. Recommendations for dosing in the obese patient are antibiotic group specific but are generally based on limited evidence. Further studies on the effect of antibiotic dosing in obese patients with pneumonia on patient-centered outcomes are greatly needed.

### Dosing of antibiotics in obesity [^111ymh38]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity is becoming a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The management of infections is problematic due to both an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as a lack of information about dosing of antibiotics in the obese population. Recommendations in this patient group are severely lacking, so clinicians need to consider pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters and the relative risks of overdosing and underdosing.

Recent Findings

Since 2011, articles on a number of antibiotics have been published, including cefazolin/cephazolin, cefepime, cefoxitin, clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, daptomycin, ertapenem, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, moxifloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.

Summary

Obesity causes a number of changes, including an increase in volume of distribution and changes in hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Several antibiotics have sufficient data to be able to make recommendations, whereas other antibiotics may need to make use of doses at the upper end of the recommended range, or utilize other dose modifications based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in an attempt to reach adequate levels and achieve similar efficacy.

### Antibiotic dosing in obesity: a BIG challenge [^116tgnVA]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

When almost 60% of the world's population is predicted to be overweight by 2030, dosing regimens that are developed and tested in non-obese patients will be inappropriate for the future use of drugs. Specifically, should we no longer accept the "one-size-fits-all" mentality of antibiotic dosing and accept that individuals may in fact need to be dosed… individually? Almost all clinicians use antibiotics daily. Most use guidelines as dosing rules rather than a guide. Particularly in critical illness where dramatic changes in antibiotic concentrations can occur with similar doses, accepting guidelines as dosing rules is likely to be flawed.

Antibiotic pharmacokinetics are different in the critically ill compared with other patient groups. Firstly, there are changes to the volume of distribution (Vd). Particularly in patients with sepsis, fluid shifts from the intravascular space to the interstitium lowers the intravascular concentrations of hydrophilic antimicrobials. Furthermore, given a decrease in plasma albumin concentration is seen in approximately 40% of the critically ill, antimicrobials may further extravasate, additionally increasing Vd. Furthermore, drug clearance may be altered in those with renal impairment (hydrophilic drugs) or hepatic impairment (largely lipophilic drugs). Moreover, there is increasing evidence of enhanced renal elimination of renally cleared drugs (augmented renal clearance) in the critically ill.

In the obese, there can be a significant change in the Vd of both hydrophilic and lipophilic antimicrobials consequential to increases in both adipose and lean muscle mass. The degree to which Vd is altered is generally regarded to be a function of the lipophillicity of the drug, although hydrophilic antimicrobials also have Vd alterations secondary to an increased volume of lean muscle, the significance of which is debated.

Additionally, the precise effect obesity has on antimicrobial clearance is unclear, with literature scarce. In healthy obese patients renal flow is augmented compared with non-obese. The exact mechanism is debated, though "obesity-related glomerulopathy", a collective term for glomerulomegaly, with or without focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, along with increased renal plasma flow and associated increased glomerular filtration rate is likely to be the cause. As patients age and obesity-related nephropathies develop, however, renal function can be reduced. Subsequently, obese patients may develop reduced drug clearance compared with age-matched comparators, especially those critically ill with augmented renal clearance.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^117Esg2n]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial dosage adjustments in obese patients — For aminoglycosides, base dosage on adjusted body weight (ideal body weight plus 40% of the excess weight above ideal weight). For β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and for cephalosporins, use dosages at the higher end of treatment ranges, or use standard dosages with therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill obese patients. For fluoroquinolones, use dosages at the higher end of treatment ranges, or base dosage on adjusted body weight (ideal body weight plus 45% of the excess over ideal body weight). For clindamycin, use higher dosages up to 4.8 g/d in patients with a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2. For vancomycin, base dosage on actual body weight, with limitation of the total dose to 4 g/d. For linezolid, dosage adjustment for obesity is not currently recommended. For daptomycin, base dosage on total body weight.

### Anti-infective dosing for obese adult patients: a focus on newer drugs to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^112ZjdfU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Obesity is recognized to be a risk factor for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) that are associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Several new antimicrobial agents have been introduced to treat MRSA-related ABSSSI and are dosed with and without regard to weight. This review seeks to explain the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) rationale for initial and maintenance dosage selection of these newer agents in obese adults.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed using the key words obese or obesity, pharmacokinetics, and the name of each MRSA active drug evaluated in this review. Major themes were identified through a review of this literature. A synopsis of key findings from population PK studies (including reference sources) and independent studies of the PK properties of each new MRSA active agent used to treat ABSSIs were reviewed to derive practical dosing considerations.

Findings

Clinical trials of ABSSSIs have increasingly incorporated individuals across a wide body size spectrum. This inclusion of obese adults has been reflected in population PK analyses that have permitted the evaluation of weight and other body size descriptors. In general, the volume of distribution is higher in obese patients, suggesting the need for higher initial (loading) doses if PK bioequivalence is desired. Less certainty exists with selection of a higher maintenance dose, especially for antimicrobial agents with time-dependent PK-PD properties. Selection of higher maintenance doses through alternate scaling approaches in obese patients can be justified on an individual clinical basis.

Implications

Maintenance dose modification of several MRSA-targeted anti-infective agents is unlikely to be necessary in obese patients and should be capped if dosed on total weight or this higher dose justified with therapeutic drug monitoring.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Data regarding the dosing of antibiotics in obese patients with pneumonia are limited. With the exception of aminoglycosides and vancomycin, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of most other antibiotics have not been extensively investigated in the obese population. The role of antibiotic loading doses and therapeutic drug monitoring for antibiotics other than vancomycin and aminoglycosides need further investigation. The correlation between plasma antibiotic concentrations and lung tissue levels in obese patients is lacking and warrants further study. Further studies on the effect of dosing of antibiotics in obese patients with pneumonia on patient-centered outcomes, including recovery, relapse, and mortality, are needed.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^111kuVEa]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obesity, defined by the World Health Organization as a body mass index (BMI) greater or equal to 30 kg/m², is a worldwide uncontrolled epidemic: in 2005 it was estimated that 400 million adults were obese, whereas it is projected that more than 700 million will be obese in 2015. Obesity is a risk factor for more frequent and longer hospital stays, and for more post-operative and hospital-related infections. Optimal management of these infections requires early administration of appropriate antibiotics. Both the choice of the antibiotic and the administration of an appropriate dose (according to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles) are important factors to improve the outcome of severe infections.

Recommended daily doses of antibiotics are based on PK studies performed essentially in non-obese patients. However, the PK of hydrophilic antibiotics that are essentially eliminated by renal clearance, like β-lactams, may be altered in obese patients. Indeed, the volume of distribution (VD) may be increased because of greater lean body mass and more adipose tissue, and renal clearance may be either increased because of greater kidney mass and global filtration or decreased because of chronic hypertensive or diabetic nephropathy.

Lower β-lactam serum concentrations in obese than in non-obese patients have been reported in sparse case reports and limited case series. However, we previously showed that in critically ill patients, inadequate serum concentrations of broad-spectrum β-lactams were mainly due to sepsis alone, rather than to obesity. In a recent study, Sturm et al. also showed that obese, critically ill patients do not need higher dosage regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) than non-obese individuals. The question remains: is obesity responsible for significant PK changes of β-lactams in infected, but not critically ill patients? The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of standard β-lactam dosage regimens in infected, obese but not critically ill patients and to identify risk factors associated with inadequate drug concentrations.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^1127So5z]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, more than 600 million people are living with obesity, and this number is continuing to rise. Obesity increases the likelihood of developing diabetes, coronary heart disease and many other chronic illnesses, and individuals with obesity are more likely to require surgical procedures at earlier stages of life. Furthermore, patients with obesity who undergo surgery are at greater risk of developing intra- and post-surgical complications, such as venous thromboembolism, delayed wound healing and surgical site infection (SSI). SSI can be of particular concern, as it reduces survival rates, increases disease-related morbidity, increases duration of hospital stay and increases the likelihood of hospital re-admissions. Combined, these factors result in significant costs to the healthcare system. To minimise the risk of SSI, it is standard procedure to administer intravenous prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery from clean-contaminated surgery and beyond.

Patients with obesity have significant physiological changes such as altered renal function and body volume and composition, which in turn can alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of many drugs. This can potentially reduce the efficacy of a standard dose for non-obese individuals. As such, dose adjustments are often warranted in this patient population. Cefazolin, a hydrophilic beta-lactam antibiotic, is widely used in SSI prophylaxis. A standard dose of cefazolin is 2 g given as an intravenous bolus within 15–60 min prior to surgery. Studies have aimed to determine whether this dose is efficacious in patients with obesity, or whether practice guidelines should be updated to include a higher recommended dose for this group of patients. These studies fall into two broad categories: clinical outcome studies and pharmacokinetic studies. Outcome studies assess the incidence of SSI, usually 30 days following surgery, aiming to ascertain whether a standard 2-g dose of cefazolin was sufficient in preventing SSI in patients with obesity. Pharmacokinetic studies measure the cefazolin concentrations in plasma and/or body tissues before and during surgery. These drug tissue concentrations are compared with a pre-determined target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to assess adequacy of dosing.

Although many clinical and experimental studies have been conducted to examine whether patients with obesity need higher cefazolin dosing, no systematic review has combined both outcome and pharmacokinetic studies to draw a rigorous conclusion. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to gather and critically evaluate the current data surrounding prophylactic cefazolin dosing in patients with obesity, informing evidence-based clinical practice.

Aminoglycosides

Aminoglycoside dosing is based on weight and kidney function, with subsequent dosage modifications guided by therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing on ideal body weight (IBW) tends to underdose obese patients, whereas dosing on TBW tends to overdose them. Adjusted body weight (ABW) is usually recommended for aminoglycosides dosing (Table 1). One study evaluated ABW for weight-based dosing in 31 morbidly obese patients who received gentamicin or tobramycin 5–7 mg/kg every 24 h. Serum drug concentration was therapeutic in 71%, supratherapeutic in 13%, and subtherapeutic in 16%. The only variable that correlated with supratherapeutic levels was older age (P = 0.04). Another study demonstrated that estimated lean body weight (LBW) (Table 1) was better than TBW and IBW to predict aminoglycoside Vd, and showed an improved prediction of aminoglycoside clearance using equations that estimate GFR rather than CL cr (Table 1). Even when aminoglycosides achieve therapeutic lung concentrations, they might be inactivated by local conditions in the infected areas of the lung, including local hypoxia, cellular debris, and tissue acidosis, thus decreasing their effectiveness in pneumonia. In conclusion, aminoglycosides should be used in combination regimens for pneumonia treatment. Loading dose should be based on ABW or LBW, with subsequent dose and interval based on estimated GFR and drug level.

Vancomycin

Studies in obese patients demonstrated higher vancomycin clearance in young adult morbidly obese patients that necessitates higher doses to have adequate trough concentration. Vancomycin loading below the recommended dose was thought to contribute to delay in the achievement of therapeutic drug concentrations in one trial for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend the following antibiotic regimens for healthcare-associated or community-acquired MRSA pneumonia: intravenous vancomycin (15–20 mg/kg of TBW every 8–12 h, not to exceed 2 g per dose for patients with normal kidney function) or linezolid (600 mg orally/intravenously twice daily), or clindamycin (600 mg orally/intravenously three times daily) for susceptible strains. The guidelines also suggest vancomycin loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg of TBW in seriously ill patients and recommend serum trough concentration measurements prior to the fourth or fifth dose and having vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 μg/ml. Individual doses of 1.5 g or greater should be infused over at least 1.5–2 h.

Surgical Infection Society revised IAI guidelines — antimicrobial dosing in adult patients: Use standard dosages for lower-risk patients who are not severely obese and who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade 1-B). Consider use of higher dosages in selected higher-risk patients (Grade 2-B). Use adjusted dosages based on outcome data, pharmacokinetic parameters, and therapeutic drug monitoring, where applicable, in patients with significant renal impairment (Grade 2-B), and use adjusted dosages of selected, hepatically eliminated or metabolized agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). Consider use of adjusted dosages based on outcome data and pharmacokinetic parameters in obese patients (Grade 2-B). Do not use prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotic agents routinely in all patients, but consider these approaches as options in critically ill patients and those at risk for infection with resistant gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-B).

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^116NYi8E]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- Perioperative dosing recommendations for cefazolin, used as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections, are currently inconsistent for obese patients.
- Pharmacokinetic data for cefazolin from plasma and interstitial space fluid (ISF) of adipose tissue obtained by microdialysis for obese and nonobese surgical patients receiving prophylactic cefazolin were analysed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.
- In the context of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, administration of 2 g cefazolin i.v. with redosing at 4 h was the most suitable dosing regimen for both obese and nonobese patients such that no dose adjustment is necessary.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) pose a significant risk to patient safety. However, the incidence of SSIs can be reduced by use of appropriate perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of SSI is higher in obese than in nonobese patients. Obesity is associated with atypical anthropometric values and pathophysiological alterations that can influence drug pharmacokinetics. These alterations include changes in body composition, tissue distribution, and renal and hepatic drug elimination. Consequently, standard dosing regimens of antibiotics might not provide optimal drug exposure in obese patients, potentially compromising the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, highlighting the need for identifying optimal prophylactic dosing regimens for obese patients.

### Antibiotic dosing in obesity: a BIG challenge [^1151gPuR]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The abovementioned changes to both Vd and clearance become especially important in those patients that are "super obese". Significantly higher loading doses are likely to be necessary to accommodate the increased Vd, whilst comparatively lower maintenance doses may be required to avoid drug toxicities in those with reduced clearance. Clearly, when combining the effects of being critically ill and obese, it is difficult to accurately predict the pharmacokinetics of any given antimicrobial. Ultimately, the assumption of linear correlations between lean or total body weight, Vd and drug clearance is problematic and prospective pharmacokinetic trials in critically ill obese patients should be performed to define robust dosing guidelines.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic whose clinical response is dependent on the 24-h area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio. It is generally accepted that a target AUC:MIC ratio > 400 is optimal. Despite being hydrophilic, vancomycin has a wide Vd in critically ill patients (> 1.0 L/kg) and > 90% is renally cleared. As such, taking into account the abovementioned pharmacokinetic alterations in both the obese and the critically ill, dosing can be challenging.

Recent literature comparing vancomycin dosing requirements administered by continuous infusion in obese versus non-obese patients has presented two interesting findings. Firstly, the daily weight-based vancomycin dose was significantly lower for obese compared with non-obese patients when administered by continuous infusion whilst achieving target concentrations. This is unsurprising given clearance is the primary determinant of maintaining steady state concentrations after initial loading is complete. Furthermore, no significant difference in non-weight normalized vancomycin clearance between obese and non-obese patients with preserved renal function was found with minimal correlation to total body weight. This implies that measures of renal function rather than measures of weight are most important for maintenance dosing. These data are similar to recent findings in non-obese critically ill populations, although there are ultimately many ill-defined variables that preclude direct extrapolation of non-obese data.

RISK FACTORS FOR DOSING CHANGES IN OBESE PATIENTS

Obesity results in several alterations that affect antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These alterations are summarized in Fig. 1 and discussed below.

FIGURE 1
Mechanisms by which obesity alters antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Absorption

Studies have shown that delayed gastric emptying may occur in obese people, which may result in lower antibiotic absorption and plasma concentration. As a result of higher consumption of fatty meals, absorption might be higher for lipophilic antibiotics.

Distribution

The volume of distribution (Vd) is a theoretical volume in which a drug amount uniformly distributes to produce the desired plasma concentration. It is calculated by dividing the antibiotic dose by its plasma concentration. A high Vd indicates that the drug extensively distributes to tissues and a low Vd indicates that the drug is concentrated in the plasma. Vd is affected by the medication properties including lipophilicity, hydrophilicity, plasma protein binding, and molecular weight. Lipophilic medications are generally associated with higher Vd, whereas hydrophilic medications are associated with lower Vd (Fig. 1). Obesity increases Vd, especially for lipophilic antibiotics, because of increased lean body mass and increased adipose tissue which can lead to lower than expected plasma antibiotic concentrations. Of note, Vd may further increase during critical illness, especially for hydrophilic medications because of capillary leak and fluid resuscitation. Taking into consideration the other properties of the antibiotics and the clinical presentation, the total body weight (TBW) is generally recommended for dosing of lipophilic antibiotics and the ideal or adjusted body weight for hydrophilic antibiotics.

Metabolism

In obesity, fatty infiltration of the liver may lead to hepatic dysfunction. Additionally, the levels of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes increase and others decrease or do not change. However, the influence of obesity on hepatic antibiotic metabolism is largely unknown.

Antimicrobial dosing in adult IAI patients — Standard dosing recommendations for antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of patients with IAI are listed in Table 11. For lower-risk patients with CA-IAI who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment or severe obesity, the task force believes these dosage recommendations should be fairly accurate. Critically ill patients may benefit from adjusted dosing of many antimicrobial agents, although the evidence supporting this for patients with IAI is mostly limited.

### Optimization of dosing regimens and dosing in special populations [^115nJLVh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of infectious diseases is becoming increasingly challenging with the emergence of less-susceptible organisms that are poorly responsive to existing antibiotic therapies, and the unpredictable pharmacokinetic alterations arising from complex pathophysiologic changes in some patient populations. In view of this fact, there has been a progressive work on novel dose optimization strategies to renew the utility of forgotten old antibiotics and to improve the efficacy of those currently in use. This review summarizes the different approaches of optimization of antibiotic dosing regimens and the special patient populations which may benefit most from these approaches. The existing methods are based on monitoring of antibiotic concentrations and/or use of clinical covariates. Measured concentrations can be correlated with predefined pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets to guide clinicians in predicting the necessary dose adjustment. Dosing nomograms are also available to relate observed concentrations or clinical covariates (e.g. creatinine clearance) with optimal dosing. More precise dose prediction based on observed covariates is possible through the application of population pharmacokinetic models. However, the most accurate estimation of individualized dosing requirements is achieved through Bayesian forecasting which utilizes both measured concentration and clinical covariates. Various software programs are emerging to ease clinical application. Whilst more studies are warranted to clarify the clinical outcomes associated with the different dose optimization approaches, severely ill patients in the course of marked infections and/or inflammation including those with sepsis, septic shock, severe trauma, burns injury, major surgery, febrile neutropenia, cystic fibrosis, organ dysfunction and obesity are those groups which may benefit most from individualized dosing.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^111QjCbv]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus on whether a standard 2-g prophylactic cefazolin dose provides sufficient antimicrobial coverage in obese surgical patients. This systematic review analysed both outcome and pharmacokinetic studies, aiming to determine the appropriate cefazolin dose. A systematic search was conducted using 4 databases. In total, 3 outcome and 15 pharmacokinetic studies met the inclusion criteria. All 3 outcome studies concluded that there is no need for increased dose. Also, 9 pharmacokinetic studies reached this conclusion; however, 6 pharmacokinetic studies recommended that 2-g dose is insufficient to achieve adequate plasma or tissue concentrations. The stronger body of evidence supports that 2-g dose of cefazolin is sufficient for surgery lasting up to 4 h; however, large-scale outcome studies are needed to confirm this evidence.

### Antibiotic dosing in obesity: a BIG challenge [^113pNFnm]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Ultimately, the paucity of data in obese, critically ill populations may force us to accept that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is still the way forward. There is, however, a caveat: the AUC:MIC ratio is rarely measured in clinical practice. Rather, serum trough concentration targets of 15–20 mg/L are advocated as a reliable surrogate. Neely et al. recently showed, however, that the AUC was underestimated by an average of 23% when using trough concentrations alone, leading to potential excessive vancomycin exposure and unnecessary risks of toxicity. As such, caution when relying on this alone is prudent.

Whilst vancomycin concentrations are easily measured, concentrations of other antibiotics used in obese patients are measured far less frequently. For example, a recent review concluded that very few hospitals worldwide perform beta-lactam TDM on a routine basis despite its availability likely being much higher. This disparity may be because, traditionally, beta-lactam antibiotics had a wide therapeutic window and risk of toxicity was low (compared with other antibiotics routinely measured). However, given the effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics depends on the duration that serum concentrations are greater than the target pathogen's MIC and there is increasing evidence of beta-lactam resistance, it is easy to see that we may inadvertently dose patients poorly if assumptions of uniform pharmacokinetics between non-obese and obese populations are made.

In conclusion, vancomycin clearance may be similar in obese and non-obese populations, with smaller weight-based dosages required to maintain steady state concentrations. Despite this, given the relative paucity of prospective data surrounding antibiotic pharmacokinetics in the combined obese and critically ill cohort, it is clear that TDM makes sense to ensure target concentrations are achieved to increase the likelihood of clinical efficacy.

### Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis dosing in adult patients with obesity: a comprehensive review of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data [^113Gv4yE]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an important measure to prevent postoperative surgical site infections. Current guideline recommendations do not treat obesity specifically, although it can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The objective of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the need for obesity-related dosing adjustments in surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating antibiotic prophylaxis dosing in surgical patients with obesity. Outcomes of interest were pharmacokinetic parameters such as plasma and interstitial fluid concentrations, area under the concentration time curve in plasma and in interstitial fluid, and other pharmacokinetic measures. Thirty studies investigating cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, ertapenem, metronidazole, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were included in this analysis. Except for metronidazole, cefoxitin, and gentamicin, there is currently no evidence suggesting the need for dosing adjustments.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^117P1UcH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Infections occur frequently in critically ill patients and their management can be challenging for various reasons, including delayed diagnosis, difficulties identifying causative microorganisms, and the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In this review, we briefly discuss the importance of early infection diagnosis, before considering in more detail some of the key issues related to antibiotic management in these patients, including controversies surrounding use of combination or monotherapy, duration of therapy, and de-escalation. Antibiotic pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, notably volumes of distribution and clearance, can be altered by critical illness and can influence dosing regimens. Dosing decisions in different subgroups of patients, e.g., the obese, are also covered. We also briefly consider ventilator-associated pneumonia and the role of inhaled antibiotics. Finally, we mention antibiotics that are currently being developed and show promise for the future.

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^115sYv5Y]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cefazolin is commonly used for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis owing to its activity against pathogens frequently encountered in SSIs, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Some studies have investigated the need for perioperative prophylactic cefazolin dosing adjustments for obese patients, but the results are contradictory. Although the majority of evidence supports standard dosing for cefazolin (2 g, short-term i.v. infusion), three out of four studies that applied modelling and simulation frameworks concluded the opposite. In addition, a second antibiotic dose is recommended after twice its half-life, which would be 3–4 h after the first dose in the case of cefazolin, but this recommendation has not been investigated conclusively.

For cefazolin, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target has been set to unbound drug concentration in plasma above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 100% of the operation time. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, it is also essential to measure drug concentrations at the site of potential infection (interstitial space fluid [ISF] of soft tissue), as drug exposure in plasma might not reflect exposure in the ISF. Unbound drug concentrations from the ISF can be obtained by microdialysis, a minimally invasive sampling technique to obtain target-site concentrations. Pharmacometric models, which allow simultaneous integration and analysis of data from different sources (e.g. measurements from plasma and ISF), can be used to simulate concentration–time profiles to investigate the influence of obesity on the probability of achieving a specific PK/PD target.

We aimed to evaluate the adequacy of clinically relevant cefazolin dosing regimens (i.e. dose and dosing intervals) for obese patients for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and to derive dosing recommendations by application of modelling and simulation techniques. We leveraged published PK data from obese and nonobese patients, integrating observed cefazolin concentrations in both plasma and ISF.

β-Lactams

A study that evaluated critically ill patients (49 obese and 59 nonobese patients; 49% with lung infection) who had received broad-spectrum β-lactams (cefepime, piperacillin and tazobactam, or meropenem) at standard dosing regimens found considerable variability in β-lactam serum concentrations (coefficient of variation of 50–92% for all drugs) in obese and nonobese patients. The standard dosing regimens resulted in insufficient plasma concentrations in 32% of patients and overdosed concentrations in 25%. For meropenem, more obese patients had concentrations that did not reach therapeutic targets than nonobese patients (35 versus 0%; P = 0.02), but no differences were observed for cefepime and piperacillin and tazobactam. In the same study, patients on continuous renal replacement therapy were more likely to have supertherapeutic β-lactam serum concentrations and less likely to have insufficient β-lactam serum concentrations.

### Serum piperacillin / tazobactam pharmacokinetics in a morbidly obese individual [^116aAFRj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report pharmacokinetic alterations and optimal dosing of piperacillin/tazobactam in an obese patient.

Case Summary

A 39-year-old morbidly obese (weight 167 kg, body mass index 50 kg/m2) man was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g every 4 hours for recurrent cellulitis. The wound culture grew Groups A and B Streptococcus and rare Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Blood samples were obtained at steady-state from a peripheral venous catheter at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the start of the infusion. Population pharmacokinetics were generated from a previously published data set. The serum concentrations of piperacillin/tazobactam obtained in the patient were compared with the 95% confidence interval from the representative population. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximal serum concentration, minimal serum concentration, average steady-state concentration, half-life, elimination rate constant, volume of distribution (V(d)), clearance, area under the curve at steadystate, and percent of time greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (%t > MIC) were calculated and qualitatively compared between the sample and the population.

Discussion

Substantial differences were noted in both the absolute values at the times of sample collection and the overall concentration-versus-time profile of both compounds. The morbidly obese individual compared with the population demonstrated a reduced average serum steady-state concentration: 39.8 mg/L versus 123.6 mg/L, an increased V(d): 54.3 L versus 12.7 L, and an increased half-life: 1.4 hours versus 0.6 hours, respectively. The %t > MIC of piperacillin for the patient, assuming MICs of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 mg/L, was 100%, 100%, 90.9%, 55.4%, 19.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.

Conclusions

Pathogens with elevated MICs may require altered dosing schemes with piperacillin/tazobactam. Future studies are warranted to assess increased dosages, more frequent dosing intervals, or continuous infusion dosing schemes for obese individuals with serious infections.

INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial therapy in obese patients for different infections, including pneumonia, represents a clinical challenge because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, this area is understudied and underappreciated. A recent large cohort study of adult patients with septic shock, including patients with pneumonia, showed that the total daily administered doses of commonly used antibiotics did not differ among the different body mass index (BMI) groups. This translated to lower dose per kg in the obese and very obese patients compared with the normal BMI patients even after adjustment for creatinine clearance. Another retrospective study at an emergency department (ED) found that the adherence rates to hospital guidelines for the first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin in patients with weights more than 100 kg and BMI greater than 40 kg/m 2 were only 8.0, 3.0, and 1.2%, respectively. Additionally, obesity has been associated with antibiotic underdosing and treatment failure. A cohort study of mostly outpatients receiving oral antibiotics for different reasons including lower respiratory tract infection found that obesity was a significant predictor of antibiotic treatment failure, defined as any additional antibiotic prescriptions or hospitalizations for infections within 30 days after initial therapy [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–1.52].

In this review, we will highlight the recent studies of commonly used antibiotics in obese patients with community or healthcare-associated pneumonia. We focus on the dosing regimens rather on antibiotic selection, which is beyond the scope of this review. Of note is that most studies have evaluated plasma drug levels as the main endpoint and only a few evaluated lung tissue levels. The association of different dosing regimens with clinical endpoints, such as pneumonia recovery, recurrence, and mortality, are seriously understudied.

Persons Who Are Obese or Underweight

Body weight can affect both volume of distribution as well as metabolism and elimination of antimicrobials. In general, adjustments in dose are most important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. These adjustments are independent of those related to alterations in hepatic or renal function.

Aminoglycosides have a narrow therapeutic index and require therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid toxicity. For patients who are underweight (Body mass index [BMI] < 18.5), initial dosing should be based on total body weight (TBW). For patients who are obese (BMI ≥ 30.0), initial dosing should be based on adjusted body weight (ABW), calculated as ideal body weight (IBW) plus 40% of excess body weight: ABW = IBW + ([TBW − IBW] × 0.4). In addition, once daily dosing of aminoglycosides might not be appropriate for patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also should be dosed according to ABW in obese adults when prescribing doses > 8 mg/kg/day (Supplementary Appendix 4).

Ciprofloxacin should be dosed at the upper end of the dosing range for patients who are obese. No dosing adjustment is necessary for levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Similarly, tetracyclines do not require dose adjustment for patients who are obese or underweight. Chloramphenicol should be dosed according to TBW in all cases, and serum concentration monitoring should be performed when available, especially in children.

For children, less specific dosing information is available. Evidence indicates that aminoglycosides can be dosed according to ABW for children who are obese (as for adults), whereas all other agents should be dosed according to TBW. In all cases, total dose for children should not exceed the maximum dose for an adult.

The authors note that the use of PIs may be a reliable approach to improve fT > MIC and ensure adequate serum concentrations in obese patients, but larger-than-standard doses are often also needed.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^1176Prqf]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cefazolin is the most widely used drug for SSI prophylaxis. Although it has a wide therapeutic window, the use of unnecessarily high doses increases costs, increases selection pressure on mutations for resistance and could increase the risk of C. difficile infection. Conversely, under-dosing increases the risk of infection and resistance. Current guidelines on prophylactic cefazolin dosing for patients with obesity do not give consistent recommendations. For instance, the British National Formulary recommends 1 g given before surgery followed up with another 0.5–1 g after 2 h, without any adjustment for body weight. In contrast, the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines recommend 2 g in adults, and 3-g dose "is reasonable" in patients weighing more than 120 kg, citing studies that draw mixed conclusions, including some that do not recommend a change in dosage. Resources such as those published by UpToDate mimic American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guidelines recommending 3-g cefazolin dose if the patient weighs more than 120 kg. This recommendation is based on few studies, with only one that directly investigated cefazolin dosing in patients with obesity.

Although most studies included in this review assessed pharmacokinetic data, prevention of infection is the primary goal of the prophylactic dosing strategy, and outcome studies provide the real-world outcome data. Two outcome studies concluded that above 2-g dose is neither required nor efficacious. A third study found non-statistically significantly higher SSI rates in the obese cohort compared to the non-obese cohort, who all received 2 g. Overall, outcome studies do not support prophylactic doses higher than 2 g cefazolin in surgical patients with obesity.

Drawing conclusions from pharmacokinetic studies is more complex than from outcome studies, as a greater number of variables are assessed in these studies. Forms of heterogeneity between studies, such as type of surgery, cefazolin doses given, participant characteristics, MIC targets adopted, sampling methods and the simulation approaches, result in increased complexity. Grouping studies by such categories may help discern whether any of these factors predicted a particular conclusion.

The global epidemic of obesity has led to an increased prevalence of chronic diseases and need for pharmacological intervention. However, little is known about the influence of obesity on the drug exposure profile, resulting in few clear dosing guidelines for the obese. Here we present a semi-mechanistic model for lean body weight (LBW) that we believe is sufficiently robust to quantify the influence of body composition on drug clearance, and is therefore an ideal metric for adjusting chronic dosing in the obese.

### Vancomycin dosing in obese patients: special considerations and novel dosing strategies [^113jXe6M]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding vancomycin pharmacokinetics in obese patients and strategies used to improve dosing in this population.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE (1974 to November 2017), and Google Scholar searches were conducted using the search terms vancomycin, obese, obesity, pharmacokinetics, strategy, and dosing. Additional articles were selected from reference lists of selected studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Included articles were those published in English with a primary focus on vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters in obese patients and practical vancomycin dosing strategies, clinical experiences, or challenges of dosing vancomycin in this population.

Data Synthesis

Volume of distribution and clearance are the pharmacokinetic parameters that most often affect vancomycin dosing in obese patients; both are increased in this population. Challenges with dosing in obese patients include inconsistent and inadequate dosing, observations that the obese population may not be homogeneous, and reports of an increased likelihood of supratherapeutic trough concentrations. Investigators have revised and developed dosing and monitoring protocols to address these challenges. These approaches improved target trough attainment to varying degrees.

Conclusions

Some of the vancomycin dosing approaches provided promising results in obese patients, but there were notable differences in methods used to develop these approaches, and sample sizes were small. Although some approaches can be considered for validation in individual institutions, further research is warranted. This may include validating approaches in larger populations with narrower obesity severity ranges, investigating target attainment in indication-specific target ranges, and evaluating the impact of different dosing weights and methods of creatinine clearance calculation.

### Evaluation of the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: a model-based analysis of cefazolin pharmacokinetics [^111UUn3B]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cefazolin is used as a prophylactic antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs). Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for SSIs. Cefazolin dosing recommendations and guidelines are currently inconsistent for obese patients. As plasma and target-site exposure might differ, pharmacokinetic data from the sites of SSIs are essential to evaluate treatment efficacy: these data can be obtained via tissue microdialysis. This analysis was designed to evaluate the need for dosing adaptations in obese patients for surgical prophylaxis.

Methods

Data from 15 obese (BMI median = 52.6 kg/m²) and 15 age- and sex-matched nonobese patients (BMI median = 26.0 kg/m²) who received 2 g cefazolin i.v. infusion for infection prophylaxis were included in the analysis. Pharmacokinetic data from plasma and interstitial space fluid (ISF) of adipose tissue were obtained and analysed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Dosing regimens were evaluated by calculating the probability of target attainment (PTA) and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for plasma and ISF using unbound cefazolin concentration above minimum inhibitory concentration 100% of the time as target (fT > MIC = 100%). Dosing regimens were considered adequate when PTA and CFR were ≥ 90%.

Results

Evaluation of cefazolin doses of 1 and 2 g with redosing at either 3 or 4 h by PTA and CFR in plasma and ISF found 2 g cefazolin with redosing at 4 h to be the most suitable dosing regimen for both obese and nonobese patients (PTA > 90% and CFR > 90% for both).

Conclusions

This model-based analysis, using fT > MIC = 100% as a target, showed that cefazolin dosing adaptations are not required for surgical prophylaxis in obese patients.

Antimicrobial dosing recommendations by patient risk and organ function — We recommend use of standard doses of antimicrobial agents for lower-risk patients with CA-IAI who are not severely obese and who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of higher dosages of antimicrobial agents for selected higher-risk patients with severe or advanced IAI or HA-IAI (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses for patients with significant renal impairment, with therapeutic drug monitoring where applicable (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses of selected, hepatically cleared agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses of selected agents for management of IAI in obese patients (Grade 2-B). We suggest that prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotic agents does not need to be used routinely for treatment of IAI, but is an option for critically ill patients and those at risk for infection with resistant gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-B).

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114Gpebb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with septic shock, administering a first "loading" dose is probably as fundamental as the timing of administration, depending on the antimicrobial agent. The volume of distribution (V D) of hydrophilic agents (such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides) in septic shock patients may be increased due to increased microvascular endothelial permeability, expanding the extracellular fluid compartment. Loading doses of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides (especially with once-daily dosing) or glycopeptides are recommended to maximize the therapeutic effect.

Once initiated, the antibiotic regimen should be reassessed at least daily, given that fluctuating organ function, common in critically ill patients, may substantially affect antibiotic exposure. For example, lower doses of antibiotics excreted in urine should be administered in the presence of impaired renal function, whereas higher than standard doses should be administered in patients with augmented renal clearance (e.g. burn patients, obesity). Antibiotic therapy represents a challenge for obese patients because of altered PK/PD. Obesity increases V D, especially for lipophilic antibiotics, which can lead to lower-than-expected plasma antibiotic concentrations. Augmented renal clearance is frequent. In addition, fatty infiltration of the liver may impair hepatic function. In general, regardless of body mass, the dosing of lipophilic antibiotics should be based on total body weight, or adjusted body weight for hydrophilic antibiotics. Individualized dosing, supported by laboratory testing, is essential owing to patient heterogeneity and clinical fluctuation.

Renal clearance

Obese individuals have increased antibiotic clearance from the systemic circulation because of increased kidney mass and glomerular filtration. This may become even more relevant during critical illness, likely because of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome compounded by fluid resuscitation and vasoactive medications. In a prospective observational study in surgical and medical ICU patients (n = 128) receiving antibiotics, augmented renal clearance, defined as at least one creatinine clearance (CL cr) greater than 130 ml/min/1.73 m², was present in 51.6% of them and was associated with higher treatment failure (27.3 versus 12.9%; P = 0.04). However, obese patients with chronic hypertensive or diabetic nephropathy may have decreased antibiotic clearance. Antibiotic dosing in obese patients should take into consideration these variations in kidney function. Unfortunately, studies have shown that the equations that estimate kidney function (Table 1) do not provide accurate results in obese patients. A study found that the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-estimating equation was less accurate in obese compared with nonobese patients. Another study found that Cockcroft–Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formulae performed poorly in obese potential kidney donors. In the same study, CL cr measurement based on 24-h urine collection performed better, although this finding was based only on data from the 15% of patients who had adequate urine collection. Considering the inaccuracies of CL cr and GFR equations, direct measurement of CL cr in critically ill obese may be needed.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^113Sk2vH]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Body habitus (obesity) and prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery — In a retrospective review, an analysis of the 22 patients who developed an infection found six were obese, and analyzed as a subgroup, obesity was found to be a risk factor with a p-value (p < 0.04). The critique notes there was no analysis of adjustments made to the antibiotic regimen in relation to the patients' BMI, and obesity was found to be an independent risk factor for postoperative infection in this retrospective review despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics. This study offers Level III prognostic evidence that obesity is a risk factor for perioperative infection, but does not offer clear evidence for a specific adjustment of antibiotic prophylaxis in obese patients. Future directions for research state that prospective, randomized clinical trials are suggested to evaluate the effect of antibiotic choice and altered dosing on infection rates in obese patients.

Patients with Obesity or Who Are Underweight

Volume of distribution, metabolism, and elimination of antimicrobials can be affected by body weight. Adjustments in dose might be necessary and are most important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. aminoglycosides). These adjustments are independent of those related to alterations in hepatic or renal function.

Ciprofloxacin should be dosed at the upper end of the dosing range for patients with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30). No dosing adjustment is necessary for levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Similarly, tetracyclines do not require dose adjustment for patients with obesity or who are underweight.

Aminoglycosides have a narrow therapeutic index and require therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid toxicity. For patients with a BMI ≥ 30, initial dosing should be based on adjusted body weight (ABW), calculated as ideal body weight (IBW) plus 40% of excess body weight: ABW = IBW + ([total body weight − IBW] × 0.4). Of note, once daily dosing of aminoglycosides might not be appropriate for patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40). For patients who are underweight (BMI < 18.5), initial dosing should be based on total body weight.

For children, less specific dosing information is available. Evidence indicates that aminoglycosides can be dosed according to ABW (as for adults) for children with obesity, whereas all other agents should be dosed according to total body weight. In all cases, total dose for children should not exceed the maximum dose for an adult.

### Optimization of the treatment with β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients-guidelines from the French society of pharmacology and therapeutics (sociéTéfrançaise de pharmacologie et Thérapeutique-SFPT) and the French society of anaesthesia and intensive care medicine (sociéTéfrançaise D'anesthésie et Réanimation-SFAR) [^113HezKq]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Modifications of the volume of distribution (Vd) and renal clearance of beta-lactams are major sources of PK variability observed in critical care patients. For instance, mean Vd and clearance of cefepime could vary in ICU patients from 0.08 to 0.55 L/kg and 0.062 to 0.131 L/kg/h, respectively. Patients' diseases also influence antibiotic PK. For instance, Isla et al. reported higher Vd and clearance of meropenem in polytraumatised patients than in septic patients (Vd 69.5 vs. 15.7 L and clearance 54 vs. 8 L/h). Such an important variability of Vd and clearance has been reported for almost all beta-lactam antibiotics.

Another issue is the increasingly frequent management of obese patients in the ICU. Indeed, obesity has been associated with modifications of beta-lactam PK, notably due to an increased Vd. Indeed, increases in adipose and lean masses and increase in blood volume contribute to increase the Vd of both lipophilic and hydrophilic (such as beta-lactams) antimicrobials. Beta-lactam protein binding may also be modified in obese patients due to increased plasma concentrations of fatty acids and α1-acid glycoprotein. Lastly, obese patients may present an augmented renal clearance due to the increased kidney size and renal blood flow associated with obesity. Because drug dosing in obese patients is a specific issue and is not restricted to beta-lactam antibiotics and critically ill patients, formulating a specific recommendation for obese patients is out of the scope of the present guidelines and will not be further discussed.

Finally, one should remind that patient's clinical condition may change rapidly during his ICU stay, towards either improvement and cure or degradation and organ failures. As a consequence, drug pharmacokinetics frequently change during the treatment period for a given patient, as already reported for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams.

R1.2.1. We suggest determining the glomerular filtration rate by calculating creatinine clearance with the formula U × V/P at the onset of treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics, and every time the clinical condition and/or renal function of the patient significantly changes.

R1.2.2. We suggest determining the glomerular filtration rate by calculating creatinine clearance with the formula U × V/P every time beta-lactam concentration is measured in order to help in interpreting the result.

Antimicrobial dosing optimization in critically ill intra-abdominal infection (IAI) patients — optimizing dosing is presented as another means to conserve antimicrobial resources, with altered pharmacokinetic parameters common in critically ill patients (including those with IAI) that can cause underdosing and overdosing. The guideline states that extended infusions to optimize pharmacodynamics are an attractive approach but have not yet shown clear clinical benefits in patients with IAI, and that dosing optimization for patients at the extremes of age, obese patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment has not been investigated sufficiently and should be considered given their risk profile.

Pharmacodynamic considerations

Figure 2 describes the most important antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters. These are the percentage of time that the antibiotic concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC), the ratio of peak concentration to MIC (C max /MIC), and the ratio of the area under the concentration–time curve to MIC (AUC/MIC). T > MIC predicts the efficacy of time-dependent antibiotics (Fig. 2). The ideal concentration is 2–4-fold the MIC of the pathogenthroughout the dosing interval. T > MIC can be optimized by increasing antibiotic dose or frequency or using continuous or extended infusions. The C max /MIC predicts the efficacy of concentration-dependent antibiotics (Fig. 2). C max is dependent on the dose and is inversely related to Vd. The AUC 24h /MIC predicts the efficacy of antibiotics with mixed properties (Fig. 2). AUC 24h /MIC can be optimized by increasing the antibiotic dose. Obesity may decrease T > MIC, C max /MIC, and AUC 24h /MIC mainly by affecting antibiotic Vd and clearance.

### Multicenter evaluation of vancomycin dosing: emphasis on obesity [^1167yaWC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of data available regarding the dosing of antimicrobials in obesity. However, data are available demonstrating that vancomycin should be dosed on the basis of actual body weight.

Methods

This study was conducted at 2 tertiary care medical centers that did not have pharmacy-guided vancomycin dosing programs or other institutional vancomycin dosing policies or protocols. Patients who received vancomycin between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2006, were stratified by body mass index and randomly selected from the computer-generated queries. Patients ≥ 18 years of age with a creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min who received vancomycin for at least 36 hours were included.

Results

Data were collected on a random sampling of 421 patients, stratified by body mass index, who met the inclusion criteria. Most patients in each body mass index category received a fixed dose of vancomycin 2 g daily divided into 2 doses (underweight 82%, normal weight 90%, overweight 86%, and obese 91%). Adequate initial dosing (≥ 10 mg/kg/dose) was achieved for 100% of underweight, 99% of normal weight, 93.9% of overweight, and 27.7% of obese patients (P < .0001). Ninety-seven percent of underweight, 46% of normal weight, 1% of overweight, and 0.6% of obese patients received ≥ 15 mg/kg/dose recommended by several Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Pharmacists also failed to correct inadequate dosing because only 3.3% of patients receiving less than 10 mg/kg/dose had their regimen changed in the first 24 hours of therapy.

Conclusion

In this multicenter pilot study, obese patients routinely received inadequate empiric vancomycin using a lenient assessment of dosing. Greater efforts should be undertaken to ensure patients receive weight-based dosing because inadequate dosing can lead to subtherapeutic concentrations and potentially worse clinical outcomes.

Fluoroquinolones

Data about fluoroquinolones' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in obese patients are limited. In a 179-kg man, levofloxacin 750 mg every 12 h versus 750 mg daily resulted in an AUC approximately double that found in the nonobese healthy population. In contrast, another study evaluated levofloxacin (750 mg intravenously over 90 min) in 15 obese people (12 hospitalized and 3 ambulatory volunteers), and found that peak concentrations and Vd were similar in the acutely ill obese patients, the ambulatory obese volunteers, and historical normal-weight volunteers. Additionally, levofloxacin clearance was higher (> 2×) in the ambulatory obese than the acutely ill obese patients, which resulted in significantly lower AUC. Moxifloxacin was assessed in 12 morbidly obese patients and found that its serum pharmacokinetics were comparable to historical data in normal-weight individuals. In conclusion, optimal dosing of fluoroquinolones in the obese population is difficult to determine, but dosage adjustment is probably not warranted. Older data suggest that ciprofloxacin is affected by obesity and doses up to 800 mg every 12 h should be considered in morbidly obese patients.

Macrolides

The effect of macrolides against most bacteria is considered to be time dependent with significant postantibiotic effect. Data on macrolide use in obese patients with pneumonia are scarce. For Helicobacter pylori treatment, higher doses and longer durations of macrolide therapy have been suggested. Whether higher doses and longer durations should be used in obese patients with pneumonia remains uncertain.

### Underdosing of common antibiotics for obese patients in the ED [^115gweC9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is a growing problem in the United States. Obesity alters the pharmacokinetic profiles of various drugs. Although there are guidelines for dose adjustments for many of the antibiotics commonly used in the emergency department (ED), they are seldom used.

Methods

This is an institutional review board-approved retrospective study at an American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence and a level I trauma center with annual ED volumes of more than 80,000 visits. Data were retrospectively collected from ED pharmacy records during a 3-month period in 2008. Any first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, or ciprofloxacin administered in our ED to a patient recorded as both more than 100 kg and with a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m(2) was compared with our hospital guidelines and found to either adhere or not adhere to those guidelines.

Results

There were 1910 orders found to meet the study criteria: 775 orders for cefepime, 625 orders for cefazolin, and 510 orders for ciprofloxacin. Adherence rates for first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin administered, respectively, were 8.0%, 3.0%, and 1.2%.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians frequently underdose cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin in obese patients. Underdosing antimicrobials presents risk of treatment failure and may promote antimicrobial resistance. Education is necessary to improve early antibiotic administration to obese patients.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^115WZ73C]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

It has already been shown that none of the current existing equations to estimate glomerular filtration are adequate to properly identify ARC in the intensive care unit patient; ARC is best identified in the clinical setting by urine collects lasting several hours. In our study, we found no difference in measured and estimated CrCL, but our study was probably underpowered for this analysis. In other studies, CrCL CG has been shown to over-estimate CrCL 24h in obese patients, thus providing an explanation why five patients in our cohort received greater doses of antibiotics than if their dosage regimen had been adapted to their CrCL 24h. ARC has probably been overlooked in the obese patient population because very few studies actually measure or estimate CrCL in infected, obese, non-critically ill patients, particularly when patients appear to have a 'normal' renal function such as a serum creatinine value less than 1.0 mg dL −1. Furthermore, PK studies in obese patients are very limited, and cohorts are small. More studies are needed to identify obese patients with ARC. However, even if a patient with ARC is identified, there is currently no recommended upward daily dose adjustment for patients with a CrCL > 80 mL min −1.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^114jPWFw]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Loading dose recommendations and obesity considerations specify that in order to achieve rapid attainment of targeted concentrations in critically ill patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, a loading dose of 25 to 35 mg/kg can be considered for intermittent-infusion administration of vancomycin (B-II). Loading doses should be based on actual body weight and not exceed 3,000 mg, and dosing in obese patients should be based on actual body weight with doses capped at 3,000 mg, with more intensive therapeutic monitoring also advised in obesity.

Obese adults — vancomycin dosing and AUC monitoring is addressed with specific thresholds and monitoring guidance. Empiric maintenance doses for most obese patients usually do not exceed 4,500 mg/day (B-II), and early and frequent monitoring of AUC exposure is recommended for dose adjustment, especially when empiric doses exceed 4,000 mg/day (A-II). Measurement of peak and trough concentrations is recommended to improve the accuracy of vancomycin AUC estimation and maintenance dose optimization in obese patients, aligning with recommendations 2 and 5 for nonobese adults.

### Drug dosing in hospitalized obese patients with COVID-19 [^116C4jdD]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Obesity is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients admitted with COVID-19. Evidence based guidelines are available for COVID-19-related therapies but dosing information specific to patients with obesity is lacking. Failure to account for the pharmacokinetic alterations that exist in this population can lead to underdosing, and treatment failure, or overdosing, resulting in an adverse effect. The objective of this manuscript is to provide clinicians with guidance for making dosing decisions for medications used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A detailed literature search was conducted for medications listed in evidence-based guidelines from the National Institutes of Health with an emphasis on pharmacokinetics, dosing and obesity. Retrieved manuscripts were evaluated and the following prioritization strategy was used to form the decision framework for recommendations: clinical outcome data > pharmacokinetic studies > adverse effects > physicochemical properties. Most randomized controlled studies included a substantial number of patients who were obese but few had large numbers of patients more extreme forms of obesity. Pharmacokinetic data have described alterations with volume of distribution and clearance but this variability does not appear to warrant dosing modifications. Future studies should provide more information on size descriptors and stratification of data according to obesity and body habitus.

### Antibiotic dosing in children in Europe: can we grade the evidence from pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic studies-and when is enough data enough? [^111UkAFj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antibiotics are prescribed more frequently to children than any other class of medication. Analysis of the evidence behind antimicrobial dosing regimes is imperative to improve clinical outcomes, minimize antimicrobial resistance development, and to identify priority research areas for the future. This review aims to promote debate amongst paediatricians, pharmacologists, and pharmacists about how to improve antimicrobial prescribing by considering methods to develop and disseminate optimal dosage information.

Recent Findings

There has been increasing use of population analyses to understand pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters in children. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling is widely accepted to be the method of choice for analyses of PK/PD data. However, communicating the quality of PK/PD studies is an equally important factor to allow clinicians to gauge the robustness of the evidence. The possibility of grading PK/PD studies is discussed, along with using systematic reviews and PK/PD meta-analysis for generating high-quality evidence. Many doses in existing formularies (including the British National Formulary for Children) are based on outdated evidence. The need to update formularies to account for new evidence, population changes (e.g. obesity), and changing patterns of resistance requires a more systematic evaluation of antimicrobial PK/PD relationships in children. The possibility of e-formularies with links directly to the evidence should be considered and regulators must also play a role in supporting the re-evaluation of off-patent dosing guidelines.

Summary

Advancing our understanding of the evidence behind paediatric antimicrobial therapeutic regimens is essential to improve both clinical outcomes and patient safety. Using a combination of international collaboration, electronic communication, and PK/PD modelling techniques, we can now define the gaps in our knowledge base and develop the techniques to answer them.

### Resistant starch intake facilitates weight loss in humans by reshaping the gut microbiota [^1179DDZ8]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

RS refers to a kind of fermentable dietary fibre that cannot be digested by human amylases in the small intestine and moves into the colon, where it undergoes fermentation by gut microbiota. Studies in rodents have demonstrated RS could lead to a decrease in total body fat, particularly visceral fat, as opposed to digestible starch feeding. Diets low in protein and high in carbohydrate yield the most favourable metabolic outcomes when the carbohydrate component consists of RS in mice; however, human data showed that there was no impact on the total body weight of individuals with metabolic syndrome after being fed RS for a duration spanning 4 to 12 weeks –. Low-fat diets supplemented with RS had beneficial effects on the hosts, but high-fat diets attenuated the RS fermentation and the beneficial effects. This may be one possible explanation as to why RS seemingly had no impact on body weight in the clinical trials described above, as those clinical trials did not have a high compliance rate to the diet. Moreover, this implies RS-associated gut microbiota's vital role in RS's therapeutic effects; however, RS's potential as a functional, adaptable food ingredient for obesity treatment in humans and the modulation of metabolic benefits by RS-related gut microbiome alterations remain unclear. Thus, a robust trial in obese individuals is essential to substantiate claims about RS's impact on diverse physiological aspects in consumers and the required dosage. Moreover, multi-omics approaches and gnotobiotic animal models should be used to systematically and mechanistically connect the influence of RS on the gut microbial community and the host's metabolism.

Here we performed a crossover, randomized clinical trial in individuals with excess body weight to investigate the effect of RS as a dietary supplement on obesity and other metabolic phenotypes. The trial is a feeding study providing isoenergetic and balanced background diets. Metagenomics and metabolomics analyses were conducted to assess RS's impact on gut microbiota composition and function. Additionally, we analysed the influence of RS-modified gut microbiota transferred from selected human donors to antibiotic-treated mice on host adiposity and glucose metabolism, we also explored the mechanisms underlying the metabolic advantages conferred by gut microbiota through RS.

### Daily vancomycin dose requirements as a continuous infusion in obese versus non-obese SICU patients [^116TKgsi]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled worldwide since 1980 and it is estimated that 60% of the world's population will be classified as overweight or obese by the year 2030. Given this trend, it is important to characterize the effect of obesity on drug disposition. Critically ill patients are at risk of alterations to pharmacokinetics due to having a larger volume of distribution and alteration in protein binding. Several physiologic changes in obesity affect antimicrobial pharmacokinetics. For example, the volume of distribution in obese patients is greater due to increased lean body mass and adipose tissue. Drug clearance may also be further enhanced due to increased kidney mass and filtration.

Optimizing antibiotic dosing is a priority in critically ill patients because inadequate systemic concentrations may lead to treatment failure and development of antimicrobial resistance. It is imperative that the initial dosing regimens provide adequate pharmacodynamic exposure for the most likely pathogen. Vancomycin is the most common first-line option for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or other resistant Gram-positive bacteria, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and ampicillin-resistant enterococci in severe healthcare-associated infections.

Despite an increasing number of obese patients worldwide, there is little information on how to optimally dose vancomycin in these patients. Few studies have evaluated vancomycin concentrations in obese critically ill patients, and studies are limited by small patient groups and utilization of standard intermittent vancomycin dosing. Currently, there are no studies evaluating dosing requirements in this population when receiving vancomycin continuous infusions (CIV). The aim of this study was to determine the weight-based dosing requirement of CIV necessary to reach the 24-hour target concentration in obese versus non-obese critically ill patients.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of antibiotic use in high-risk populations [^113zPa6i]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The study of pharmacokinetics includes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. The pharmacologic effect that a medication has on the body is known as pharmacodynamics. With antimicrobials, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters become especially important because of the association between host drug concentrations, microorganism eradication, and resistance. This article focuses on the pharmacokinetic changes that can occur with antimicrobials when they are used in patients at high risk of infections and how they influence pharmacodynamic effects. The populations described here include patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic failure, chronic lung disease, severe burns, and long-term prosthetic devices and the elderly.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^114B3UwN]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — vancomycin dosing and monitoring recommendations state that obese children are likely to have vancomycin exposures that may be statistically greater than those in normal-weight children when doses are calculated on a mg/kg basis, but these differences are not known to be of sufficient clinical importance to suggest different mg/kg empiric vancomycin dosages in obese children at this time; obese children < 12 years old, compared with those ≥ 12 years, may require a higher mg/kg dose (B-II). Therapeutic monitoring is likely to be of particular value in obese children, both for therapeutic response and the risk of AKI; the specific recommendations for therapeutic monitoring in nonobese children may also apply for obese children (B-II). A loading dose of 20 mg/kg by total body weight is recommended in obese children (A-III).

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing and surgical site infections: does the dose matter in obese patients? [^111xtPu8]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obese patients undergo surgical procedures more frequently than their non-obese counterparts due to obesity-related health problems, such as osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Obesity is also associated with a number of surgical complications, including an increased risk of surgical site infection (SSI). The repercussions of SSI include extended hospital stay, more frequent hospital readmissions, pain, anxiety and higher healthcare resource utilisation. However, the administration of an appropriate antibiotic at an appropriate dose before surgery significantly reduces the risk of SSI.

Cefazolin remains the drug of choice for surgical prophylaxis in many procedures due to its favourable safety profile, low cost and targeted activity against the microorganisms commonly encountered during surgical procedures. In 2013, a collective guideline for surgical prophylaxis developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), suggested an increased dose of cefazolin (3- g intravenously) for patients weighing ≥ 120 kg. Similarly, the Australian Medicines Handbook (AMH) recommends a 3-g dose of cefazolin for patients > 120 kg. The American Journal of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin and the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines (TG) also suggest the need for a higher prophylactic cefazolin dose for obese surgical patients but do not specify the recommended dose or weight or BMI cut-off values.

The dosing recommendations of those guidelines were based on small-scale and inconsistent pharmacokinetic studies (level-III according to the National Health and Medical Research Council levels of evidence). Four pharmacokinetic studies found that a 2-g prophylactic dose of cefazolin may be inadequate in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric procedures and caesarean section, due to the blood and/or tissue drug concentrations being below minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). These studies suggested the need for a higher (3- g) dose in these patients. In contrast, six pharmacokinetic studies in similar surgical specialties found that a 2-g dose did provide adequate antimicrobial coverage (concentration above MIC) in morbidly obese patients with similar weight ranges, suggesting no dose increment was required.

Given the lack of satisfactory evidence supporting 3- g dosing in obese patients and a scarcity of clinical outcome studies, this study sought to ascertain whether an intravenous 2- g dose of cefazolin was comparatively effective in obese versus non-obese surgical patients, and in those who weighed above or below 120 kg, based on the observed rate of SSI within 90 days of operation.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^116C4SFg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Gentamicin injection may be given IM or IV. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term.

PATIENTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION

Adults

The recommended dosage of gentamicin injection for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table I).

For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. This dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table I).

It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after IM injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after IM or IV administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection and the status of the patient's host-defense mechanisms.

### Tobramycin sulfate (tobramycin) [^11536ixM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function

Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy.

Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance level or the serum creatinine level of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed.

Reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals: When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram.

* Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations.

An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient's serum creatinine.

Normal dosage at prolonged intervals: If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 6.

Dosage in Obese Patients

The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient's estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg.

Intramuscular Administration

Tobramycin may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from a vial.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 199: use of prophylactic antibiotics in labor and delivery [^1115pWK9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cefazolin dosing for obese obstetric patients — dose thresholds, pharmacokinetics, and outcomes are described as follows: Increased doses are recommended for an obese patient defined as weight greater than 80 kg [175 lb] or body mass index (BMI) greater than 30; initial recommendations increased cefazolin from 1 g to 2 g, with a single preoperative 2‑g dose achieving levels comparable to a 1‑g dose in nonobese patients, and a 1‑g dose can be considered in patients weighing 80 kg or less though some hospitals have standardized 2 g for all adults; current consensus guidelines increased the dose to 3 g for patients weighing 120 kg or more undergoing nonobstetric surgery. Obstetric data are conflicting: in one cohort, obese and extremely obese women (BMI 40 or higher) receiving prophylactic 2 g had tissue concentrations at skin incision less than 4 micrograms/g, and many did not achieve MIC greater than 4 micrograms/g in adipose tissue at incision (20% and 33%) or closure (20% and 44%), whereas randomized trials of 2 g versus 3 g showed no significant difference in adipose concentrations. A population pharmacokinetic analysis concluded a 2‑g dose had a high probability of exceeding the MIC in overweight and obese women, and a multicenter retrospective cohort of 335 obese women weighing more than 300 lbs found no reduction in surgical site infections with 3 g versus 2 g (13.1% vs 13.1%).

### Cefepime dosing in the morbidly obese patient population [^112pLJDN]. Obesity Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Proper dosing of specific antibiotics in morbidly obese patients has been studied inadequately. However, these data are beneficial as this patient population is at an increased risk to develop postoperative infections. Cefepime is an antibiotic used for the treatment of both gram-positive and especially gram-negative infections; administration of the appropriate dose in the morbidly obese population is crucial. We therefore examined the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in patients with body mass index > 40 kg/m(2). Ten morbidly obese patients, with a mean [± SD] estimated glomerular filtration rate of 108.4 ± 34.6 mL/min, undergoing elective weight loss surgical procedures were administered cefepime in addition to standard prophylactic cefazolin and studied. Serial serum cefepime concentrations were analyzed after dosing using a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. Pharmacokinetics and duration above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined using a protein binding value of 15% and a MIC threshold of 8 μg/mL. Mean free cefepime concentrations for t = 30, 120, and 360 min were 69.6, 31.6, and 9.2 μg/mL, respectively. The dosing interval was calculated to maintain the free concentration above the MIC (fT > MIC) for 60% of the interval. This was determined to be 10.12 h, including time for infusion. There was no toxicity. Based on this analysis, an increased dose of 2 g every 8 h is necessary to maintain an adequate fT > MIC throughout the dosing interval. Further studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of this regimen in the settings of active infections and critical illness.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^1138vknh]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The most evident factor for potential variation between patients is the weight categories included. Studies that solely examined different doses between groups had wide mean BMI ranges (38.9–49.7 kg/m 2) and reported inconsistent findings. For instance, the study that included groups of patients from the heaviest weight ranges (BMI 40–49 kg/m² as the lowest weight group and BMI 50–59 kg/m² and > 60 kg/m² groups) concluded that higher doses are needed for patients with obesity, but another that included patients with a BMI range of 38–79 kg/m 2 2, 33 concluded that 2 g is sufficient.

Another potential reason for varied findings is that different studies used different MIC values (1 to 32 mcg/mL). Two studies chose MIC targets > 8 mcg/mL (or > 8 mcg/g), with one concluding that 2 g of cefazolin is sufficient and the other concluding that 2 g is not sufficient. Studies at the other end of the spectrum which used a defined MIC value of 1 mcg/mL to cover staphylococcal species in gastric bypass surgeries found that 2 g of cefazolin was sufficient. Studies between these two extremes, which selected MIC targets of 2–8 mcg/mL (or 2–8 mcg/g in adipose tissue), had mixed conclusions with five concluding that 2 g is not sufficient and six concluding that a 2-g dose is sufficient.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^111vUNEN]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin dosing in obesity — loading dose strategy and weight bands are outlined as follows: Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 with class I (30.0–34.9 kg/m2), class II (35.0–39.9 kg/m2), and class III (≥ 40 kg/m2). Weight-indexed vancomycin volume of distribution (Vd) is lower in morbid obesity, for example 0.32 L/kg in morbidly obese vs 0.68 L/kg at normal weight, and lower Vd estimates of approximately 0.5 L/kg or weight-independent central tendency estimates approaching 75 L are observed in obese adults. Using actual body weight-based loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg with consideration of capping at 3,000 mg is described as the most practical strategy in obese patients with serious infections, resulting in calculated loading doses of 1,500 to 2,500 mg for 80 to 99 kg, 2,000 to 3,000 mg for 100 to 119 kg, and 2,500 to 3,000 mg for ≥ 120 kg, with doses rounded to the nearest 250 mg.

### Gentamicin [^117T1xqi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Gentamicin Injection may be given intramuscularly or intravenously. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term.

DOSAGE FOR PATIENTS

WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION

Children: 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day. (2 to 2.5 mg/kg administered every 8 hours).

Infants and Neonates: 7.5 mg/kg/day. (2.5 mg/kg administered every 8 hours).

Premature or Full-term Neonates One Week of Age or Less: 5 mg/kg/day. (2.5 mg/kg administered every 12 hours).

It is desirable to measure periodically both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin when feasible during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection) is expected to be in the range of 3 to 5 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after intramuscular or intravenous administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection, and the status of the patient's host-defense mechanisms.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114118g8]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Early life antibiotic exposure and obesity risk — literature on antibiotic exposure in early life (< 2 years) is mixed, with some suggestion that it may slightly increase the risk of childhood and adolescent obesity; associations are stronger with repeated antibiotic exposure, exposure within the first 6 months of infancy, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use, with boys appearing more susceptible to weight gain than girls, and it is hypothesized that effects relate to alteration of the gut microbiome.

### The individual response to antibiotics and diet-insights into gut microbial resilience and host metabolism [^11595fkA]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotic use disrupts microbial composition and activity in humans, but whether this disruption in turn affects host metabolic health is unclear. Cohort studies show associations between antibiotic use and an increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we review available clinical trials and show the disruptive effect of antibiotic use on the gut microbiome in humans, as well as its impact on bile acid metabolism and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. Placebo-controlled human studies do not show a consistent effect of antibiotic use on body weight and insulin sensitivity at a population level, but rather an individual-specific or subgroup-specific response. This response to antibiotic use is affected by the resistance and resilience of the gut microbiome, factors that determine the extent of disruption and the speed of recovery afterwards. Nutritional strategies to improve the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome, as well as its recovery after antibiotic use (for instance, with prebiotics), require a personalized approach to increase their efficacy. Improved insights into key factors that influence the individual-specific response to antibiotics and dietary intervention may lead to better efficacy in reversing or preventing antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis as well as strategies for preventing cardiometabolic diseases.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^114QFFwT]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we showed that when standard doses were administered to infected, obese, non-critically ill patients, an insufficient number of patients treated with TZP or CEF reached therapeutic serum concentrations according to established criteria to treat an infection due to P. aeruginosa. However, when aiming to treat infections due to Enterobacteriaceae spp. only patients treated with TZP did not attain these therapeutic concentrations. When considering more severe PD targets (T > 4MIC), only treatment of infections due to Enterobacteriaceae spp. with CEF permitted more than 90% of patients to attain therapeutic serum concentrations and none of the antibiotics attained the PD target when treating infections due to P. aeruginosa. The low antibiotic serum concentrations observed in our obese cohort was attributed to an increase in VD and CL for all of the studied drugs, compared with non-obese patients. In agreement with the observed increased drug CL, an augmented renal clearance (ARC), defined by a CrCL of more than 150 mL min −1, was found in 25% of our obese cohort. ARC was the only risk factor identified for failure to reach therapeutic concentrations for infections due to P. aeruginosa.

There are sparse data in the literature on the PK of broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese, non-critically ill patients: one PK study in 10 obese patients who received cefepime for prophylaxis during bariatric surgery, two case reports on the PK of TZP in 2 morbidly obese individuals, and one PK study on the administration of TZP as a prolonged infusion in 14 obese, infected individuals. Our data are concordant with these data, suggesting that PK parameters are altered in obese, non-critically ill patients. The VD and CL of the antibiotics in our cohort were increased compared with values reported in PK studies in non-obese patients. Together, these data suggest that standard dosage regimens, particularly for TZP, are insufficient in obese, non-critically ill patients. Insufficient serum concentrations could be the cause for the lower cure rates observed by Zakrison et al. in obese patients when compared with non-obese patients treated with TZP for complicated intra-abdominal infections. The greater VD and CL may justify both higher loading and total daily doses in obese patients.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^112zzAkY]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Standard doses of MEM, TZP and CEF resulted in serum concentrations too low to treat infections due to bacteria with high MICs in obese, non-critically ill patients. We identified ARC as the major risk factor for these low serum concentrations. Based on this study, we have initiated a more detailed PK study on broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese patients. PK variables and the impact of factors like ARC on this patient population will be better characterized to recommend appropriate daily doses in a near future.

### International consensus recommendations for the use of prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112zLVeL]. Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Obesity and β-lactam pharmacokinetics — doripenem, piperacillin–tazobactam, and meropenem: Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and Monte Carlo simulations indicate that prolonged/extended infusion (PI/EI) can improve target attainment and reduce variability from body weight and renal function; for doripenem, a short infusion (SI) regimen of 500 mg every 8 hours infused over 1 hour was adequate for susceptible bacteria at MIC ≤ 2 mg/L, whereas PIs and/or larger-than-standard doses would be needed for less susceptible pathogens, and standard doses were considered adequate only when using lower PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) targets such as 40% fT > MIC; meropenem PK was reported as comparable among nonobese, obese, and morbidly obese adults, though a larger steady-state volume of distribution was noted in morbidly obese patients.

### Clindamycin hydrochloride [^111hy6bx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment

The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal disease.

Geriatric Patients

Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61–79 years) and younger adults (18–39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4–5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1–4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1.

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years

An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity.

### Antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and on continuous renal replacement therapy: can we resolve this problem with pharmacokinetic studies and dosing guidelines? [^111e55aT]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Given the sources of beta-lactam pharmacokinetic variability highlighted, Ulldemolins and colleagues suggest a general approach to dosing of patients. Although the concepts are useful, a paucity of data means that robust guidance and conclusions are limited. For example, data on the size of loading doses, the influence of patient morphology (for example, obese versus non-obese), sites of infections (for example, deep-seated infections), susceptibility of the bacteria, and the risks from antibiotic overdosing (for example, toxicity and cost) are not included. It is anticipated that these factors are important considerations for optimizing beta-lactam dosing, although their significance on the basis of existing data and the other complex changes noted in critical illness requires further research. Other research of interest, prompted by this research, includes the utility of biomarkers of organ function and disease severity for guiding antibiotic dosing and the clinical impact of dose optimization on patient outcomes. The poor overall outcomes of critically ill patients with sepsis mandate the importance of such research.

To develop a dosing guideline that accounts for variation in each of these parameters as well as in RRT modalities and settings, a large multicenter RRT pharmacokinetic study is required. The newly commencing SMARRT (SaMpling Antibiotics in Renal Replacement Therapy) Study may, in time, provide such answers (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613000241730).

Until such a robust guideline becomes available, clinicians will be reliant on applying dosing flowcharts such as that proposed by Choi and colleagues or by actually measuring antibiotic concentrations using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Although various difficulties are associated with establishing and running a TDM program for beta-lactams in critically ill patients, it remains the only way to know with certainty whether the patient has therapeutic exposures of the prescribed beta-lactam antibiotic and so must be considered a desirable intervention for optimizing care of critically ill patients with septic shock.

### Antibiotics, obesity and the link to microbes-what are we doing to our children? [^111LK2sa]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood obesity and overweight are among the greatest health challenges in the pediatric population. Obese individuals exhibit marked differences in the composition of the intestinal microbial community as compared to lean subjects. These changes in the gut microbiota precede the clinical manifestation of overweight. Convincing experimental data suggest a causal role for intestinal microbes in the development of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

Discussion

Exposure to antibiotics exerts a devastating impact on the intestinal microbial community. Epidemiological studies have provided evidence indicating that early or repeated childhood exposure to antibiotics is associated with increased risk of overweight later in childhood but the causal role of this exposure in obesity development is not clear. However, data from studies conducted using experimental animal models indicate that antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota influence host metabolism and lead to fat accumulation. The intestinal microbiota perturbation caused by antibiotic exposure in the perinatal period appears to program the host to an obesity-prone metabolic phenotype, which persists after the antibiotics have been discontinued and the gut microbiota has recovered. These observations may have serious implications in the clinical setting, since a substantial number of human infants are subjected to antibiotic treatment through the mother during delivery or directly in the immediate neonatal period. The clinical significance of these exposures remains unknown.

Summary

Prudent use of antibiotics is paramount not only to reduce the propagation of antibiotic-resistant organisms but also to minimize the potentially detrimental long-term metabolic consequences of early antibiotic exposure. Improved means of reliably detecting neonates with bacterial infection would reduce the need for empirical antibiotic exposure initiated based on nonspecific symptoms and signs or risk factors. Finally, means to support healthy microbial contact in neonates and infants requiring antibiotic treatment are needed.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^1143wsrz]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

F. Body habitus — antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery states that obese patients are at higher risk for postoperative infection when given a standardized dose of antibiotic prophylaxis, yet in spite of this conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against recommending a different protocol for patients based upon body habitus, with Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence). Retrospective case control data identified independent risk factors including diabetes (odds ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 10), suboptimal timing of prophylactic antibiotic therapy (odds ratio = 3.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.5, 7.9), a preoperative serum glucose level of > 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) or a postoperative serum glucose level of > 200 mg/dL (> 11.1 mmol/L) (odds ratio = 3.3, 95% confidence interval = 1.4, 7.5), and obesity (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 4.7); this study provides Level IV prognostic evidence that obesity is an independent risk factor for surgical site infection in spinal surgery patients, and infection occurred at a 2% overall rate in all patients in the face of prophylactic antibiotics, and the authors suggest that increasing the antibiotic dosage to adjust for obesity is an important strategy to decrease the risk of surgical site infection after spinal operations. Additional Level IV prognostic evidence reported that body mass index was not found to be a risk factor for developing an infection after spinal surgery, while the adjusted relative risk for diabetes was significant (RR 4.49, 95% C. I. = 1.37–12.32), with 195 spinal infection patients included in the study, 30 with diabetes and 165 without.

### Antibiotic therapy of pneumonia in the obese patient: dosing and delivery [^114a8ZWk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Linezolid

Twenty adult obese volunteers (BMI = 30–54.9 kg/m 2) receiving five linezolid doses (600 mg intravenously every 12 h) had AUC exposures similar to those of nonobese patients. In 12 critically ill patients with VAP (median weight = 80 kg), linezolid (loading dose = 600 mg followed by 1200 mg/day by continuous infusion) resulted in a linezolid alveolar diffusion of 100% and concentrations exceeding almost twice the susceptibility breakpoint for Staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/l) in both serum and epithelial lining fluid for 100% of the time. Hence, it is recommended to use standard linezolid dosing in obese patients with pneumonia with consideration of continuous infusion.

Antibiotic dosing for prophylaxis — timing, indications for additional dosing, and weight-based cefazolin dosing specify that for most antibiotics, including cefazolin, prophylaxis should be administered within 1 hour before skin incision and if quinolones or vancomycin are necessary, up to 2 hours is allowable; additional antimicrobial prophylaxis dosages or increased doses may be warranted in three circumstances: obesity, lengthy procedure, and excessive blood loss; for all adult patients, the recommended usual dosage of cefazolin is 2 g intravenously with a further increase to a 3-g intravenous dose for patients who weigh more than 120 kg, while a 1-g dose can still be considered for women who weigh 80 kg or less, and a 2-g dose for all patients who weigh 120 kg or less simplifies the regimen, with many experts recommending weight-based dosing for vancomycin and gentamicin; for lengthy procedures, additional intraoperative doses are recommended at intervals of two times the half-life of the drug measured from the initiation of the preoperative dose, and cefazolin should be redosed 4 hours from the preoperative dose; in surgical cases with excessive blood loss, a second dose may be appropriate, and an additional dose of cefazolin is suggested when blood loss exceeds 1,500 mL.

### Clindamycin hydrochloride (Cleocin hydrochloride) [^1123rhtK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment

The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal disease.

Geriatric Patients

Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61–79 years) and younger adults (18–39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4–5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1–4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1.

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years

An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^111SVHVB]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, this is a preliminary, simplified PK study on a heterogeneous cohort in terms of type of infection, causative pathogens and time of blood sampling, not designed to evaluate the impact of adequate dosage on outcome. Furthermore, we calculated the percentage of patients who reached PD targets, instead of using techniques such as Monte–Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of PD target attainment.

Second, as in all other published series on obese, infected patients, the fT of β-lactams was not measured, but estimated, despite that the fT may be different in obese than in non-obese patients. Third, we did not perform a case–control study but compared our results to data from the literature. We did use PK/PD criteria for efficacy as proposed by EUCAST for the general population. If obese patients were like the general population in terms of PK parameters, more than 90% of our patients receiving MEM, TZP and CEF should have attained the PD target of fT > MIC. Fourth, only ARC was identified as a factor for insufficient serum concentrations by univariate and multivariate analysis. The sample size of our cohort may have been too small to identify other factors. Finally, the median BMI of our patients was 36 kg/m², with only a very few patients with a BMI > 50 kg m −2. Serum concentrations may be even lower in a more obese patient cohort.

This study was performed to determine whether or not a more detailed PK study on β-lactams in obese, infected not critically ill patients is warranted. Because our study does suggest that PKs of β-lactams are truly altered in obese patients, a PK study on obese and non-obese individuals, with detailed serum sampling, measurement of fT and utilization of techniques such as Monte–Carlo simulation is currently being carried out.

Conclusion

Utilization of CIV in obese patients consistently achieves target therapeutic serum concentrations and reduces the total weight-based daily exposure of vancomycin compared to non-obese patients. CIV clearance is similar in obese and non-obese patients and does not increase proportionally to TBW.

### Broad-spectrum β-lactams in obese non-critically ill patients [^112SSRAy]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives:

Obesity may alter the pharmacokinetics of β-lactams. The goal of this study was to evaluate if and why serum concentrations are inadequate when standard β-lactam regimens are administered to obese, non-critically ill patients.

Subjects and methods:

During first year, we consecutively included infected, obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ⩾30 kg/m²) who received meropenem (MEM), piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) or cefepime/ceftazidime (CEF). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, or those hospitalized in the intensive care unit were excluded. Serum drug concentrations were measured twice during the elimination phase by high-performance liquid chromatography. We evaluated whether free or total drug concentrations were > 1 time (fT > minimal inhibition concentration (MIC)) or > 4 times (T > 4MIC) the clinical breakpoints for Pseudomonas aeruginosa during optimal periods of time: ⩾40% for MEM, ⩾50% for TZP and ⩾70% for CEF.

Results:

We included 56 patients (median BMI: 36 kg m −2): 14 received MEM, 31 TZP and 11 CEF. The percentage of patients who attained target fT > MIC and T > 4MIC were 93% and 21% for MEM, 68% and 19% for TZP, and 73% and 18% for CEF, respectively. High creatinine clearance (107 (range: 6–398) mL min −1) was the only risk factor in univariate and multivariate analyses to predict insufficient serum concentrations.

Conclusions:

In obese, non-critically ill patients, standard drug regimens of TZP and CEF resulted in insufficient drug concentrations to treat infections due to less susceptible bacteria. Augmented renal clearance was responsible for these low serum concentrations. New dosage regimens need to be explored in this patient population (EUDRA-CT: 2011-004239-29).

### Long-acting lipoglycopeptides vs antibiotics in serious infections… [^111sPk5G]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that laLGPs are an effective alternative to standard-of-care antibiotics for the step-down treatment of serious gram-positive bacterial infections. Importance Serious bacterial infections such as bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis typically require prolonged intravenous antibiotics. Long-acting lipoglycopeptides, such as dalbavancin and oritavancin, offer extended treatment intervals for gram-positive infections that may benefit populations with barriers to traditional treatment, including persons who use drugs. Conclusions and Relevance In this study of laLGPs vs SOC, findings suggested that laLGPs were effective as step-down treatment of serious gram-positive bacterial infections, offering comparable outcomes to those of SOC antibiotics in PWUD and non-PWUD individuals.

Clinicians may consider laLGPs as alternative step-down options to SOC antibiotics for the treatment of serious gram-positive bacterial infections. Dalbavancin and oritavancin, with half-lives of 346 and 393 hours, respectively, show promise in treating serious bacterial infections. 13–15 Therapeutic concentrations of laLGPs may remain above minimum inhibitory concentrations for many gram-positive organisms in serum and deep tissues for up to 8. Among 5070 PWUD participants, the 3 most common terminal antibiotics in the SOC group were vancomycin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. In this comparative effectiveness study, we examined utilization patterns and clinical effectiveness within a target trial emulation framework of laLGPs for the management of serious bacterial infections among PWUD and non-PWUD participants in a US national database.

We found individuals who received laLGPs had similar 90-day treatment outcomes compared with those who received SOC antibiotics and across individual serious bacterial infections. This is an encouraging finding for the off-label use of laLGPs and adds to the evidence base supporting the effectiveness of laLGPs among PWUD and non-PWUD individuals. 17–24. In this comparative effectiveness study of laLGPs, we observed that laLGPs may be effective as step-down options in treating serious gram-positive bacterial infections, offering comparable outcomes to SOC antibiotics in both PWUD and non-PWUD populations. Our study highlighted utilization patterns and supported the clinical effectiveness of laLGPs in serious bacterial infections among a diverse patient population.

### Appropriate systemic therapy dosing for obese adult patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114hgjfZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction and scope — Obesity is commonly defined as a body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) ≥ 30, and between 1999 and 2018 the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in US adults increased from 30.5% to 42.4%; this clinical practice guideline addresses six clinical questions.

### International survey of antibiotic dosing and monitoring in adult intensive care units [^1164iwtv]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We describe the effectiveness of knowledge translational antibiotic dosing and monitoring strategies used to treat serious infections as the evidence has accumulated over the last 7-years. We found increased use of vancomycin and beta-lactam LDs, and that vancomycin trough or Css PK/PD targets are preferred. HICs are more likely to administer a vancomycin LD and perform TDM for vancomycin and aminoglycoside therapy. Beta-lactam infusions are now predominantly administered as an EI. TDM is increasing in clinical practice, especially in academic hospitals. Dosing software is uncommonly used.

Vancomycin

Vancomycin LDs are recommended to achieve rapid target attainment and are supported in the 2020 Consensus Guideline of vancomycin therapeutic monitoring for serious MRSA infections. It is concerning that 25% of respondents omitted a LD, and that LD omissions were even more apparent in respondents from LMICs and LICs. The LD specified by respondents did conform with the 2020 guideline recommendation; however, in our obese patient scenario, the median LD was less than the capped loading dose recommended in the Consensus Guideline (3000 mg) and may delay achieving adequate vancomycin exposure. In comparison with ADMIN-ICU 2015, we found an increased use of vancomycin LDs (74% vs 65%) (see Additional file 1: Table S7). Our findings suggest that strategies to increase the use of appropriate vancomycin LDs are required.

Although respondents from HICs administered larger MDs, all median MDs aligned with the consensus guideline dosage range, regardless of the economy of the country.

### Revisiting the loading dose of amikacin for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [^1179YLPk]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Physiologic alterations associated with increased BMI affect the aminoglycoside PK. This is due to the variable penetration of these drugs into adipose tissue. Previous studies have validated dosing weight correction factors to normalize predictions of V ss in morbidly obese subjects as well as in overweight/underweight patients in a non-ICU population. Also, IBW seems to fit the pharmacokinetics of these antimicrobials better than the total body weight (TBW) to calculate the aminoglycoside regimen; however, some uncertainty exists in this area. Our results suggest that using a DW-based regimen could result in a relative underdosing of aminoglycoside in critically ill sepsis patients when compared with a TBW-based regimen. Thus, if using IBW, a loading dose even higher than 25 mg/kg should be considered in this patient population to obtain adequate amikacin peak concentrations. Importantly, a higher dosage should be considered also in patients with a BMI < 20 to avoid underdosage. We excluded morbidly obese patients (BMI > 40), so that we cannot comment on this particular population.

### Clindamycin phosphate (Cleocin phosphate) [^114wWnkA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment

The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease.

Geriatric Patients

Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61–79 years) and younger adults (18–39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4–5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1–4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1.

Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA ≤ 32 weeks, or > 32 to ≤ 40 weeks

Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients ≤ 32 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and > 32 to ≤ 40 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours (Table 1).

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years

An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity.

### Performance of a divided-load intravenous vancomycin dosing strategy for obese patients [^116C678q]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 µg/mL in complicated infections and all trough concentrations > 10 µg/mL to avoid developing microbial resistance. To date, no published protocol reliably meets these recommendations for obese patients.

Objective

We assessed the performance of a novel, obese-specific, divided-load vancomycin protocol for attaining target trough concentrations within 12 to 24 hours of dosing initiation, and during maintenance dosing, in obese patients.

Methods

The protocol was evaluated through prospective medical record review in 54 consecutive obese patients. Vancomycin serum concentrations were drawn before the third and fifth dose after initiation. Steady-state concentrations were drawn after the third dose once maintenance dosing was achieved and periodically thereafter.

Results

Within 12 hours after dosing initiation, 48 (89%) study patients exhibited trough concentrations of 10 to 20 µg/mL averaging 14.5 ± 3.2 µg/mL; 51 (94%) study patients exhibited trough concentrations > 10 µg/mL within 12 hours after dosing initiation, and 3 (6%) had trough concentrations > 20 µg/mL. Thirty-one participants had second trough concentrations drawn within 24 hours of dosing initiation, averaging 15.0 ± 3.1 µg/mL; 24 patients had a total of 32 trough concentrations drawn during maintenance dosing, averaging 15.1 ± 2.5 µg/mL.

Conclusion

Obese-specific, divided-load dosing achieved trough concentrations of 10 to 20 µg/mL for 89% of obese patients within 12 hours of initial dosing and 97% of obese patients within 24 hours of initial dosing while preventing doses given during supratherapeutic trough levels; 97% of troughs measured during steady state were within target range.

### Anti-obesity medications and investigational agents: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^111gkRRG]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Obesity Medicine Association Clinical Practice Statement — drug distribution and protein binding in obesity note that distribution is influenced by whether a drug is hydrophilic or lipophilic, and that the "Dose of hydrophilic drugs might best be based on the ideal bodyweight (IBW)" while for lipophilic agents "Dose of lipophilic drugs might best be based upon actual body weight (including body fat)". Because patients with obesity have more body lipids, "the volume of distribution of lipophilic drugs will be increased in patients with obesity", and "Some lipophilic drugs may have detectable blood levels years after administration". Predicting dosing solely from lipophilicity is limited — "often little systematic relationship exists" between lipophilicity and distribution — so "loading doses of drugs should optimally be adjusted according to data from studies carried out specifically in individuals with obesity", and "adjustment of the maintenance dose is best determined based on data-driven modifications in clearance", while "Drugs with narrow therapeutic and safety indexes should be used prudently, with the dose adjusted based upon drug plasma concentration". Protein binding "generally prolongs availability, prolongs duration of action, delays metabolic degradation, delays excretion… and may impair drug crossing of the blood brain barrier", with the example that semaglutide "is over 99% bound to plasma albumin".
