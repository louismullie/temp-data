## Question

What is the management of a prenatal patient with positive Group B Streptococcus during labor?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a prenatal patient who tests positive for Group B Streptococcus during labor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming GBS status and the clinical context at presentation. Then, I should verify indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and the optimal timing. Next, I will review first-line and alternative antibiotic choices, including penicillin allergy management. After that, I need to check dosing regimens and the minimum effective duration. I will then examine special scenarios like preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, and unknown status. Finally, I should confirm neonatal implications, quality improvement gaps, and summarize the key principles with supporting guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and GBS status at labor onset, because management hinges on whether the patient is known GBS-positive, has unknown status, or is presenting with risk factors such as preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, or intrapartum fever, and I should verify that the antenatal screen was performed at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks using rectovaginal swabs with enrichment culture, given the shift from 35–37 weeks to 36–37 weeks in current guidance and the importance of specimen quality for sensitivity [^114oEamR] [^114yNLyw] [^115yg5Ga].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in this GBS-positive patient, because all patients with a positive antepartum vaginal-rectal culture should receive IAP unless a prelabor cesarean is performed with intact membranes, and I need to ensure that the indication is clearly documented in the chart to support neonatal management decisions [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv].

> I need to check the timing next, because the goal is to administer antibiotics as soon as labor begins or membranes rupture to maximize the likelihood of at least 4 hours of prophylaxis before delivery, and I should remember that even 2 hours can reduce vaginal colony counts and neonatal sepsis diagnoses, so I must not delay indicated obstetric interventions solely to extend antibiotic duration, but I should still aim for 4 hours when feasible [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv] [^115SLCdK].

> Let me think about first-line therapy, and I should confirm that penicillin G remains the preferred agent with ampicillin as an acceptable alternative, given their narrow spectrum, high efficacy, and favorable safety profile, and I need to ensure the order set reflects the correct regimen and dosing schedule to avoid delays in administration [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv] [^1163iqjZ].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing details so I don't misstate them. The standard regimen is penicillin G 5 million units IV initially, then 2.5 to 3 million units IV every 4 hours until delivery, and although I initially thought the maintenance dose was 2.4 million units, I should correct that to 2.5–3 million units to align with current guidance and ensure adequate maternal and fetal levels throughout labor [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv].

> I should double-check penicillin allergy management because this is a frequent source of errors. For low-risk allergy, cefazolin is preferred, whereas for high-risk allergy, clindamycin is appropriate only if the GBS isolate is susceptible, and vancomycin is reserved when clindamycin resistance is suspected or confirmed, and I need to remember that penicillin allergy testing during pregnancy is safe and can expand beta-lactam options, which improves maternal-neonatal outcomes and stewardship [^115yg5Ga] [^113dBnmg] [^114wMQR6].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not substituting oral or intramuscular regimens for intrapartum prophylaxis, because oral antibiotics during pregnancy do not reliably eradicate colonization and are not a substitute for IV IAP, and even though some have explored non-IV routes, current evidence-based practice mandates IV beta-lactam therapy in labor for optimal neonatal protection [^1114MEPN] [^1163iqjZ].

> Next, I should review special scenarios, and if membranes rupture at term in a GBS-positive patient, I need to consider induction as soon as resources allow while initiating IAP, since prolonged rupture increases transmission risk and timely prophylaxis is critical, and I should coordinate with pediatrics for neonatal observation if adequate IAP is not achieved [^1133cZoQ] [^115yg5Ga].

> Let me consider preterm labor or unknown GBS status, because in these situations IAP is indicated based on risk factors such as gestational age less than 37 weeks, rupture of membranes for 18 hours or more, or maternal intrapartum fever of 38.0°C or higher, and if rapid intrapartum NAAT is available, it can guide targeted prophylaxis, though I should confirm that NAAT-positive results warrant IAP even in the absence of other risk factors [^115yg5Ga] [^112Ne69h] [^11269QmK].

> I will now examine the neonatal implications, because if the infant is born before 4 hours of maternal IAP, the neonate is considered inadequately treated and should undergo risk-based evaluation and observation for 36–48 hours, with laboratory testing and empiric antibiotics reserved for those at higher risk or with abnormal clinical or laboratory findings, and I should ensure the pediatric team is informed of maternal GBS status and duration of IAP to guide this assessment [^115yg5Ga] [^11269QmK] [^1131sBsj].

> But wait, what if we are dealing with a prelabor cesarean with intact membranes? I should confirm that IAP is not indicated in that scenario because the risk of vertical transmission is negligible, and I need to document this clearly to avoid unnecessary maternal antibiotic exposure and neonatal interventions [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv].

> Next, I should review quality improvement data to avoid complacency, because implementation lapses are common and contribute to preventable early-onset GBS cases, with errors in screening timing, laboratory processing, communication of results, and intrapartum prophylaxis selection or timing being frequent, and I should consider EMR-driven order sets and penicillin allergy testing pathways to improve adherence and outcomes [^113rsEu8] [^116GYvjz] [^114LAP9T].

> Let me reconsider the key principles to ensure internal consistency: confirm GBS status and risk factors at presentation, start IAP promptly with a beta-lactam when indicated, aim for at least 4 hours when feasible but do not delay necessary obstetric care, tailor therapy for penicillin allergy using cefazolin or susceptibility-confirmed clindamycin or vancomycin, and coordinate neonatal risk assessment based on duration of IAP and clinical risk, aligning with ACOG, CDC, and AAP guidance [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv] [^1131sBsj].

---

For a prenatal patient who is GBS-positive, **intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)** with penicillin G or ampicillin should begin at labor onset or membrane rupture, ideally ≥ 4 hours before delivery [^115yg5Ga] [^115SLCdK]. If penicillin allergy is present, use cefazolin for low-risk allergies; for high-risk allergies, use clindamycin or vancomycin only if GBS is susceptible [^114sSoVv]. IAP is not required for a planned cesarean with intact membranes. If IAP is not given or is < 4 hours, the neonate requires observation and risk-based evaluation for early-onset GBS [^1131sBsj] [^1169PKAG].

---

## Indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)

IAP is indicated for **GBS-positive patients** under the following conditions:

- **Labor onset or membrane rupture**: Start IAP at labor onset or membrane rupture, regardless of gestational age [^1163iqjZ] [^1133cZoQ].

- **Planned cesarean delivery**: IAP is not required if cesarean is performed before labor and with intact membranes [^115yg5Ga].

- **Unknown GBS status**: Provide IAP if intrapartum risk factors are present (e.g. preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes ≥ 18 hours, or maternal fever ≥ 38°C) [^113q2pD9].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

The following antibiotic regimens are recommended for **IAP**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and administration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin G | 5 million units IV initially, then 2.5–3 million units IV every 4 hours until delivery | First-line therapy |
| Ampicillin | 2 g IV initially, then 1 g IV every 4 hours until delivery | Alternative first-line therapy |
| Cefazolin | 2 g IV initially, then 1 g IV every 8 hours until delivery | Patients with low-risk penicillin allergy |
| Clindamycin | 900 mg IV every 8 hours until delivery | Patients with high-risk penicillin allergy and GBS susceptible to clindamycin |
| Vancomycin | 1 g IV every 12 hours until delivery | Patients with high-risk penicillin allergy and GBS resistant to clindamycin |

---

## Timing and duration of IAP

IAP should be administered **ideally at least 4 hours before delivery** to maximize neonatal protection [^115yg5Ga] [^114sSoVv]. If delivery occurs within 4 hours of IAP initiation, neonatal management should be guided by risk-based evaluation [^1169PKAG].

---

## Management of penicillin allergy

Patients reporting a penicillin allergy should undergo **allergy assessment** to determine appropriate antibiotic selection:

- **Low-risk allergy**: Use cefazolin.

- **High-risk allergy**: Use clindamycin or vancomycin only if GBS susceptibility is confirmed.

- **Penicillin testing**: Encourage penicillin allergy testing during pregnancy to facilitate safe beta-lactam use [^113dBnmg] [^114mFugh].

---

## Neonatal management

Neonatal management depends on the **duration of IAP** and the presence of risk factors:

- **Adequate IAP (≥ 4 hours)**: Routine observation is generally sufficient for well-appearing infants [^notfound].

- **Inadequate IAP (< 4 hours)**: Perform risk-based evaluation, including CBC, blood culture, and clinical observation for 36–48 hours [^1169PKAG].

- **Maternal fever or chorioamnionitis**: Empiric antibiotic therapy may be indicated for the neonate [^1137WwTo].

---

## Maternal and neonatal outcomes

IAP significantly reduces **early-onset GBS disease** in neonates, with a reported reduction of approximately 80% in incidence [^113K1ah7]. Maternal outcomes are generally favorable, with minimal adverse effects reported [^1163iqjZ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Preterm labor**: IAP is indicated for GBS-positive patients experiencing preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes [^11269QmK].

- **Previous infant with GBS disease**: IAP is recommended for subsequent pregnancies regardless of current GBS status [^114oEamR].

- **GBS bacteriuria**: IAP is indicated for patients with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy [^112FHLxX].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **IAP initiation**: Begin IAP at labor onset or membrane rupture, ideally ≥ 4 hours before delivery [^115yg5Ga].

- **First-line antibiotics**: Penicillin G or ampicillin [^111imdin].

- **Penicillin allergy**: Use cefazolin for low-risk allergies; clindamycin or vancomycin for high-risk allergies only if GBS is susceptible [^11269QmK].

- **Neonatal management**: Risk-based evaluation for infants with inadequate IAP duration [^1169PKAG].

---

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is the cornerstone of **GBS prevention**, significantly reducing neonatal early-onset GBS disease. Proper implementation of IAP, including timely administration and appropriate antibiotic selection, is essential for optimal maternal and neonatal outcomes [^114sSoVv].

Regarding medical management for induction of labor, more specifically with respect to indications for induction of labor, SOGC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering induction of labor in patients negative for group B Streptococcus with a singleton pregnancy and term rupture of membranes as soon as resources allow. Offer expectant management for up to 24 hours as an alternative strategy. Avoid performing digital pelvic examinations until active labor begins, and then perform only when indicated.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^112dB6Z4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study has demonstrated that colonisation during pregnancy with Group B Streptococcus is common amongst a low risk antenatal population. Regardless of the timing of the testing, approximately 20% of women were identified with a positive swab and therefore would have been eligible, using the hospital protocol, for antibiotic use during labour. Although this colonisation rate is a little lower than that reported by Yancy et al. in their investigation of timing of swabs in 826 women (26.5% vs approx 20% in this study) there were slight differences in the study population with the former study excluding women who had received antibiotics within a week prior to birth. The test characteristics reported from the Yancy study (Sensitivity 87%, Specificity 96%, PPV 87%, NPV 96%) were all stronger than in this current study (36 weeks screen: Sensitivity 81%, Specificity 93%, PPV 77%, NPV 94%). Likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios were not reported for the former study.

This study provides clear evidence about screening timing and strategy in order to identify women colonised with GBS in labour, with more equivocal evidence about methods. Screening for GBS infection at 35–37 weeks gestation has better test characteristics and predictive values for colonisation at birth than screening at 31–33 weeks. As the hospital in which this research was undertaken has a policy of routine administration of antibiotics to women at risk of preterm birth, a delay in the timing of screening would not exclude those women at higher risk for GBS infection. In an environment in which this was not policy however, screening at 35–37 weeks may miss a particularly high-risk group.

We have defined 'high risk' as GBS bacteruria at booking, preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation, prelabour rupture of membranes or pyrexia in labour (temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees Centrigrade). The test characteristics of a screening strategy using these risk factors are relatively poor although the use of a non-independent reference standard (colonisation in labour identified following LVS and PVS) is an issue. This finding reinforces those from a multisite study sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control whose guidelines state that a risk-based strategy is not supported.

### Maternal group B. streptococcus prophylaxis improvement using an electronic medical record dynamic order set [^116GYvjz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop and implement a Group B Streptococcal (GBS) dynamic order set to improve adherence to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ACOG/CDC) guidelines.

Study Design

A team of information technology and clinical experts developed a dynamic order block. The content was patterned after the CDC "Prevent GBS" mobile app. It was then embedded in the labor and delivery/induction order set and piloted at a single high-volume obstetric unit. Following the pilot and incorporation of the 2019 ACOG update of the CDC guidelines, the order set was rolled out in five additional hospitals within a region of a large health system. Information on GBS prophylaxis performance before and after implementation was available for the pilot site and four of the additional hospitals. Information before implementation was obtained electronically from electronic medical record (EMR) laboratory and pharmacy data and supplemented by manual chart review. Postimplementation data were obtained from discrete order set EMR data elements. Adherence to the guidelines before and after were compared using chi-squared test.

Results

There were 7,114 deliveries before implementation and 4,502 after implementation. Preterm delivery occurred in 6.8 and 6.9%, respectively. There was an increase in appropriate treatment of preterm patients (positive and unknown GBS) delivering after implementation (88.7–99.1%, p < 0.001). More patients were reported to have a penicillin allergy before implementation than after implementation (14.7 vs. 11.1%, respectively, p = 0.01). Associated changes in therapy noted after implementation included a nonsignificant decrease in the proportion reporting a high-risk allergy (50.3 vs. 41.9%, p = 0.18), an increase in the appropriate use of clindamycin and vancomycin (64.4 vs. 92.3%, p < 0.001) and a decrease in clindamycin use in those without sensitivity testing.

Conclusion

Routine universal use of a dynamic admission labor/induction order set was associated with high and improved adherence to GBS prophylaxis guidelines.

Key Points

· Lapses in GBS prophylaxis are associated with early-onset GBS disease. · Preterm delivery and penicillin allergic patients are commonly associated with lapses in prophylaxis. · Dynamic EMR order set use can improve adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in patients who report a penicillin allergy: a follow-up study [^117CdkKa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare adherence to the 2002 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease in patients who are allergic to penicillin during the years 2004–2006 and 2008.

Study Design

Previous data from our institution revealed suboptimal adherence to the 2002 CDC guidelines for GBS prophylaxis among women who are allergic to penicillin. These data caused the hospital to implement a series of interventions. The original cohort (2004–2006) was compared with a cohort of women who delivered between April 2008 and January 2009 (n = 74) to determine whether the proportion of women who had antimicrobial sensitivity testing and who had received an appropriate antibiotic had improved.

Results

In 2008, 76% (95% confidence interval, 66–84%) of GBS-positive women who are allergic to penicillin received an appropriate antibiotic (compared with 16.2% in 2004–2006; P < .001). Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was performed in 79.4% of cases (95% confidence interval, 68–87%), compared with 11.4% in 2004–2006 (P < .001).

Conclusion

With directed intervention, adherence to the 2002 CDC guidelines for GBS prophylaxis in women who are allergic to penicillin improved dramatically.

### Duration of intrapartum prophylaxis for neonatal group B streptococcal disease: a systematic review [^115SLCdK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine published evidence regarding duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis administered to pregnant women colonized with group B Streptococcus (GBS) to reduce infant colonization with GBS and to prevent early-onset GBS sepsis.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1980 to January 2006), CINAHL (1982 to January 2006), and in protocols and guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Methods Of Study Selection

All randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is reported relative to subsequent neonatal GBS colonization or sepsis were considered. Case series and study designs using historical cohorts or controls for comparison were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Three prospective cohort studies and one case-control study met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of study design and assembly of cohorts precluded meta-analysis. A systematic review of the individual studies was performed. All studies were rated as fair or poor validity with regard to their ability to evaluate duration of intrapartum prophylaxis and transmission of GBS to the newborn. All 4 studies were largely composed of women with existing risk factors for GBS disease of the newborn. One study supported more than 1 hour of prophylaxis, two studies supported more than 2 hours of prophylaxis, and one was inconclusive.

Conclusion

Despite unequivocal clinical guidelines recommending at least 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, there are no well-designed studies examining duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of early-onset GBS disease of the newborn. We recommend continuing to initiate intrapartum prophylaxis according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines; however, the transmission of GBS to neonates exposed to less than 4 hours of intrapartum prophylaxis and their subsequent management require further study.

### Interpretation of 2002 centers for disease control guidelines for group B. streptococcus and evolving provider practice patterns [^114mWRBX]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We investigated if clinicians were altering their care of group B streptococcus (GBS)-positive women in labor to achieve 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on their interpretation of the 2002 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines on prevention of perinatal GBS disease. We surveyed all clinicians with privileges on the labor floor at our institution about their interpretation and clinical application of the 2002 CDC guidelines. Seventy of 96 eligible clinicians (72.9%) completed our survey. In our survey, only 22.9% of clinicians reported not altering their management of labor in GBS-positive pregnancies that achieved less than 4 hours of prophylaxis. These alterations included "laboring down" or delaying pushing; turning off or decrease an oxytocin infusion; or delaying or avoiding artificial rupture of membranes. Clinicians are altering their management of labor to attempt to achieve 4 hours of intrapartum prophylaxis. The 2002 CDC guidelines do not specifically recommend prolonging labor and are being interpreted differently in the clinical setting than the authors may have intended. The effects and consequences of this interpretation are unknown.

### Policy statement-recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease [^113K1ah7]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease were initially published in 1996. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also published a policy statement on this topic in 1997. In 2002, the CDC published revised guidelines that recommended universal antenatal GBS screening; the AAP endorsed these guidelines and published recommendations based on them in the 2003 Red Book. Since then, the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in neonates has decreased by an estimated 80%. However, in 2010, GBS disease remained the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis. The CDC issued revised guidelines in 2010 based on evaluation of data generated after 2002. These revised and comprehensive guidelines, which have been endorsed by the AAP, reaffirm the major prevention strategy — universal antenatal GBS screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for culture-positive and high-risk women — and include new recommendations for laboratory methods for identification of GBS colonization during pregnancy, algorithms for screening and intrapartum prophylaxis for women with preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes, updated prophylaxis recommendations for women with a penicillin allergy, and a revised algorithm for the care of newborn infants. The purpose of this policy statement is to review and discuss the differences between the 2002 and 2010 CDC guidelines that are most relevant for the practice of pediatrics.

### The accuracy of late third-trimester antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus in predicting colonization at delivery [^113qtZpX]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

We reevaluated the accuracy of antenatal group B streptococcal (GBS) culture results in predicting colonization at the time of delivery in a general practice setting. Patients who had late third-trimester antenatal GBS cultures were prospectively identified. A repeat GBS culture was performed when admitted in labor using a strict protocol and laboratory analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predicative values were calculated. In comparing the office culture results to the intrapartum cultures in 1472 patients, the sensitivity was 51%, specificity 94%, positive predictive value 67%, and negative predictive value 88%. The antenatal positive culture rate of 15.4% was significantly lower than the 20.1% intrapartum positive culture rate. There were 144 patients (9.8%) who had false-negative antenatal culture results. Through office survey, several aspects of the recommended antenatal procedures were not followed. The results support the previously reported high specificity and negative predictive values for this test. The near 10% false-negative rate with the significant difference between the antenatal versus intrapartum positive culture rate highly suggests that late third-trimester culture accuracy may be affected if the specified procedures are not completely followed, including the culturing technique, the use of recommended transport medium, and the laboratory culture protocol.

### Updated guidance: prevention and management of perinatal group BInfection [^111imdin]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis among term infants and a major cause of late-onset sepsis among both term and preterm infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published separate but aligned guidelines in 2019 and 2020 for the prevention and management of perinatal GBS disease. Together, these replace prior consensus guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on antenatal screening for GBS colonization remains the primary recommended approach to prevent perinatal GBS disease, though the optimal window for screening is changed to 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation rather than beginning at 35 0/7 weeks' gestation. Penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin are recommended for prophylaxis, with clindamycin and vancomycin reserved for cases of significant maternal penicillin allergy. Pregnant women with a history of penicillin allergy are now recommended to undergo skin testing, because confirmation of or delabeling from a penicillin allergy can provide both short- and long-term health benefits. Aligned with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for evaluating newborns for all causes of early-onset sepsis, separate consideration should be given to infants born at less than 35 weeks' and more than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation when performing GBS risk assessment. Empiric antibiotics are recommended for infants at high risk for GBS early-onset disease. Although intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing GBS early-onset disease, currently there is no approach for the prevention of GBS late-onset disease.

### Rapid intrapartum test for maternal group B streptococcal colonisation and its effect on antibiotic use in labouring women with risk factors for early-onset neonatal infection (GBS2): cluster randomised trial with nested test accuracy study [^116Eu6i1]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In pregnant women with risk factors for early-onset GBS infection in their babies, the use of a point-of-care rapid test in labour to diagnose maternal GBS colonisation increased the administration of intrapartum antibiotics to prevent neonatal GBS infection by a small amount, compared with the usual care strategy of risk-factor based antibiotics administration, but with considerable uncertainty. The overall maternal exposure to antibiotics for any reason was not reduced with the use of the rapid test compared with usual care, whilst more women received an adequate duration of intrapartum antepartum prophylaxis in the rapid test units.

The absence of a reduction in intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis through the implementation of a rapid testing strategy can be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, although all women in usual care units should have been offered antibiotics if they had risk factors for neonatal early-onset GBS infection, this was only administered to 36% of women, which was lower than our expected estimate. This highlights the low adherence to the national guidelines, a situation that has changed little since a surveillance study in 2014–2015 where 44% of women with risk factors received IAP. Secondly, despite the negative rapid test results for GBS colonisation, clinicians still administered antibiotics for neonatal infection prophylaxis to 17% of women. We did not explore the reasons why clinicians were motivated to offer antibiotics in this circumstance.

Maternal GBS colonisation status is considered to be a predictor for neonatal sepsis and has been incorporated in prediction models for neonatal sepsis. A strategy of rapid testing for maternal GBS colonisation in clinical practice appeared to reduce the neonatal exposure to antibiotics, with fewer newborns diagnosed with suspected early-onset sepsis requiring antibiotics. Our findings indicate that neonatologists take into consideration the results of the rapid test to make decisions on whether to start antibiotic treatment in the newborn, thereby reducing unnecessary exposure of the newborns to antibiotics.

The rapid intrapartum test showed good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing maternal GBS colonisation. Our test accuracy estimates reflect the expected accuracy of the test when implemented in routine clinical practice by midwives, unlike previous studies where the tests were invariably handled by laboratory staff.

There is some evidence to suggest an association between multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacterial colonisation in the mother with similar colonisation in the newborn at 6 weeks of age.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^114sSoVv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of newborn infection. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal colonization of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis. Obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. This Committee Opinion, including, and, updates and replaces the obstetric components of the CDC 2010 guidelines, "Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: Revised Guidelines From CDC, 2010".

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^113dBnmg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin skin testing safety and predictive value — children and pregnancy: In children, several studies have confirmed the safety of skin tests, with a rate of 1% to 3% of patients experiencing systemic reactions to skin testing, and the negative predictive value of an allergy evaluation that includes skin tests and drug challenge tests has been shown to be higher than 97% in children. In pregnancy, skin testing was found to be safe in 56 women with group B Streptococcus colonization, with only 2 (4%) experiencing a mild reaction during skin testing; although an oral challenge was not performed at the time of the skin testing, of the skin test–negative women, 47 (89%) went on to receive a full therapeutic dose of a penicillin-class antibiotic during the peripartum period with no systemic reactions observed.

Revised Recommendations for Preventing Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease

Data developed through ABCs provided a basis for revising recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Since its emergence in the 1970s, GBS disease has been the leading invasive bacterial infection associated with illness and death among newborns in the United States. Surviving infants may have long-term developmental disabilities, such as mental retardation or hearing and vision loss. Newborns at increased risk for GBS disease are those born to women who are colonized with GBS in the genital or rectal areas. Although the use of intrapartum prophylaxis has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of GBS disease during the 1990s (Figure 2), early-onset GBS disease (in infants < 7 days old) remains a leading cause of illness and death among newborns. Guidelines issued in 1996 recommended either screening pregnant women for GBS colonization by means of prenatal cultures (screening approach) or assessing obstetric risk factors intrapartum (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 782 [^116qFrhJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of newborn infection. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal colonization of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis. Obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. This Committee Opinion, including Table 1, Box 2, and Figures 1–3, updates and replaces the obstetric components of the CDC 2010 guidelines, "Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: Revised Guidelines From CDC, 2010".

### Consequences of prophylaxis for group B streptococcal infections of the neonate [^1157ewRo]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

In the 1970s, group B streptococci emerged as the leading cause of neonatal infections. The incidence ranged between 1.5 and 2 cases per 1000 in the U.S. in the 1980s up to the early 1990s. In the 1980s, selective treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics of mothers in labor turned out to be the most successful mode of prevention. In 1996, the CDC, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the use of one of two prevention strategies: the culture-based strategy or a risk-based strategy for mothers who did not have prenatal cultures. In 2002, the guidelines were updated to recommend as preferable the culture-based method, which was found to result in superior prevention compared with the risk-based method. Subsequent to the 1996 recommendations, early-onset GBS infection has been reduced by greater than 70% and racial inequalities have been narrowed. Whether exposure of millions of mothers to penicillin or ampicillin will have an undesirable effect of causing more Escherichia coli infections in neonates or will result in more ampicillin-resistant organisms being responsible for early-onset neonatal infections remains unclear.

### Intrapartum group B streptococci prophylaxis in patients reporting a penicillin allergy [^116AtG9F]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine adherence to the 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for group B streptococci (GBS) prophylaxis in patients who reported a penicillin allergy.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of GBS-positive, penicillin-allergic obstetric patients who delivered at our institution from 2004 through 2005 (N = 233). Medical records were analyzed for type of delivery, gestational age at delivery, antimicrobial sensitivity testing, and antibiotics administered. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing and appropriate prophylactic antibiotic choice were analyzed. "Appropriate antibiotic choice" was defined using the 2002 CDC guidelines for GBS prophylaxis. Women with either a scheduled cesarean delivery or a preterm delivery were excluded from analyses. Data were analyzed using Stata 9.0.

Results

Overall, 95% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91–97%) of GBS-positive, penicillin-allergic women received antibiotic prophylaxis and only 16% (95% CI 11–21%) of patients received an appropriate antibiotic. The majority of women who were given antibiotics received clindamycin (83%, 95% CI 77–87%); however, antimicrobial sensitivity testing was performed in only 11% (95% CI 9–17%) of patients. More women received an appropriate antibiotic in 2005 than in 2004 (20% compared with 11%, P = 0.11). Although the study was underpowered to evaluate the magnitude of increase, the overall prevalence of appropriate antibiotic administration in 2005 was still only 20% (95% CI 13–28%).

Conclusion

Adherence to the 2002 CDC guidelines for GBS prophylaxis in penicillin-allergic women is far from optimal. Improvements are necessary in obtaining antimicrobial sensitivity testing and choosing an appropriate antibiotic for GBS-positive women with a reported penicillin allergy.

### Application of the French guidelines for preventing neonatal group B streptococcal disease in a university hospital [^115o1bst]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the application of the French guidelines for prevention of neonatal group B streptococcus (GBS) infections. The prevalence of GBS vaginal carriage by pregnant women during the study period was 6%. Less than 50% of pregnant women testing positive for GBS were treated with at least two doses of antibiotics during labour, and most received only one dose or no antibiotics. In addition, several neonates were colonised or infected by GBS although their mothers were GBS-negative. These results are consistent with vaginal screening having a poor sensitivity, as suggested by the low prevalence of GBS carriage.

### Management of spontaneous vaginal delivery [^116DZhw8]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy dating is determined by the patient's last menstrual period or an ultrasound measurement. A full-term pregnancy is considered 37 weeks' gestation or more. Spontaneous labor begins when regular painful uterine contractions result in a cervical change. Active labor begins at 6 cm dilation and is marked by more predictable, accelerated cervical change. In the absence of pregnancy complications, intermittent fetal auscultation may be considered as an alternative to continuous electronic fetal monitoring, which is associated with a high false-positive rate. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in patients with group B streptococcus colonization or those at high risk to prevent newborn early-onset group B streptococcus. The likelihood of vaginal delivery is increased by providing continuous nonmedical support during labor, encouraging mobility, and using a peanut ball with epidural analgesia. Neuraxial analgesia is more effective for pain control than systemic opioids and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Delayed pushing during the second stage of labor has risks but does not affect the mode of delivery. Routine oropharyngeal suctioning of the newborn is not recommended, even with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Delayed cord clamping reduces newborn anemia. Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in patients at risk includes prophylactic uterotonic administration and controlled cord traction. Perineal lacerations that alter anatomy or are not hemostatic should be repaired. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):525–532.

### Incidence of fever in labor and risk of neonatal sepsis [^1137WwTo]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The current recommendation regarding the management of a term newborn delivered of a mother with an intrapartum fever or a diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis is that the neonate should have baseline laboratory work drawn along with blood cultures and be universally treated with antibiotics until culture results return. These guidelines report that the rate of intrapartum fever is about 3%; however, a few large studies suggest that the rate is higher at about 7%.

Objective

We sought to prospectively evaluate the rate of fever during labor in a large number of deliveries and determine the rate of early-onset neonatal sepsis in newborns delivered from mothers with an intrapartum fever compared with newborns delivered from mothers without intrapartum fever.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study of all temperatures obtained in women in labor from Jan. 1, 2011, through June 30, 2014. Every patient with a fever of ≥ 38°C at ≥ 36 weeks' gestation was evaluated for gestational age, parity, spontaneous or induced labor, group B streptococcus status, regional anesthesia, mode of delivery, treatment with intrapartum antibiotics, and whether a clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis was made by the managing physician. Neonates were assessed for blood culture results, neonatal intensive care unit admission, length of stay, and any major newborn complications. Statistical analysis involved χ 2, Fisher exact, and Student t test.

Results

A total of 412 patients (6.8%; 95% confidence interval, 6.2–7.5%) developed a fever in 6057 deliveries at ≥ 36 weeks' gestation. No cases of maternal sepsis occurred. Of the 417 newborns (5 sets of twins), only 1 (0.24%; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–1.3%) developed early-onset neonatal sepsis with a positive blood culture for Escherichia coli. There were 4 cases (0.07%; 95% confidence interval, 0.02–0.18%) of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the 5697 newborns (52 sets of twins) delivered from mothers who were not febrile and this difference was not significant (P = 0.3). The positive blood cultures in these 4 neonates were 3 group B streptococcus and 1 Enterococcus. The overall rate of early-onset neonatal sepsis in this population of newborns delivered at ≥ 36 weeks' gestation was 0.82/1000 deliveries.

Conclusion

The incidence of an intrapartum fever of ≥ 38°C in pregnancies at ≥ 36 weeks' gestation is common at 6.8% and this is consistent with the findings of a few other large retrospective studies. The rate of an intrapartum fever occurs in approximately 1 in 15 women in labor. The risk of neonatal sepsis in newborns delivered of mothers with intrapartum fever or a diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis is low at 0.24%, a rate that is < 1 in 400. The recommendation for universal laboratory work, cultures, and antibiotic treatment pending culture results for this newborn population needs further examination.

### Obstetric care consensus # 10: management of Stillbirth: (replaces practice bulletin number 102, March 2009) [^113Q7Eq4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Infection — stillbirth association and testing: Infection is associated with approximately 10–20% of stillbirths in developed countries, and in developed countries infection accounts for a greater percentage of preterm stillbirths than term stillbirths. Placental and fetal infections originate from either ascending pathogens (for example, group B streptococcus or Escherichia coli) or hematogenous spread such as Listeria monocytogenes or syphilis, and viral infections associated with stillbirth include cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, and Zika. Serology for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus are not included because they are of unproven benefit and not recommended.

### Women's knowledge of and attitudes towards group B. streptococcus (GBS) testing in pregnancy: a qualitative study [^114jXFdS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK 20–25% of pregnant women are carriers of group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteria, which, if not detected, can be passed from the pregnant mother to the baby during birth. It is reported that mothers who are carriers of GBS have a 36% chance that their baby will also become colonised with the bacterium during labour. For most babies, this GBS colonisation will be asymptomatic, however, around 1% of these infants will develop an invasive - GBS disease. If this occurs in the first 6 days after birth this is known as an Early Onset GBS (EOGBS) infection, which is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in newborn infants. EOGBS infections are reported to have mortality rate in the UK estimated 10.6% and higher rates of case fatality among preterm infants. These EOGBS infections typically present as pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis with evidence suggesting around 517 babies per year in the UK are affected by early-onset disease. Research suggests there are 53 deaths accountable to GBS disease in the UK annually.

GBS testing enables clinicians to identify pregnant women who carry the GBS bacterium and who therefore have the potential to transmit GBS to their babies. Women can be tested for GBS during pregnancy, which involves vaginal and rectal swab specimens being taken for culture tests. However, the current approach to managing GBS detection in the UK relies on identifying women at high risk of GBS and offering those women intrapartum antibiotics. The RCOG green top guidelines 36 identified those maternal risk factors for GBS. This practice means only those 'higher risk' women are offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to reduce the risk of babies developing EOGBS infection.

This practice in the UK is a result of the National Screening Committee's (NSC) decision not to screen universally at present until more evidence is available. The NSC made this decision due to concerns that: a woman may have a positive result a few weeks before labour and a negative result when she gives birth; GBS does not cause an infection in every baby; screening may result in women having antibiotics when they do not need them; not enough understanding of screening outweighing the harms for most of the population and that the proportion of babies affected by the disease in countries where screening is carried out is similar to that in the UK.

### Update on prenatal care [^111j6QEV]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Many elements of routine prenatal care are based on tradition and lack a firm evidence base; however, some elements are supported by more rigorous studies. Correct dating of the pregnancy is critical to prevent unnecessary inductions and to allow for accurate treatment of preterm labor. Physicians should recommend folic acid supplementation to all women as early as possible, preferably before conception, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Administration of Rho(D) immune globulin markedly decreases the risk of alloimmunization in an RhD-negative woman carrying an RhD-positive fetus. Screening and treatment for iron deficiency anemia can reduce the risks of preterm labor, intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal depression. Testing for aneuploidy and neural tube defects should be offered to all pregnant women with a discussion of the risks and benefits. Specific genetic testing should be based on the family histories of the patient and her partner. Physicians should recommend that pregnant women receive a vaccination for influenza, be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria, and be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Testing for group B streptococcus should be performed between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation. If test results are positive or the patient has a history of group B streptococcus bacteriuria during pregnancy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered to reduce the risk of infection in the infant. Intramuscular or vaginal progesterone should be considered in women with a history of spontaneous preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or shortened cervical length (less than 2.5 cm). Screening for diabetes should be offered using a universal or a risk-based approach. Women at risk of preeclampsia should be offered low-dose aspirin prophylaxis, as well as calcium supplementation if dietary calcium intake is low. Induction of labor may be considered between 41 and 42 weeks' gestation.

### Group B. streptococcus detection in pregnant women: comparison of qPCR assay, culture, and the xpert GBS rapid test [^113b8BWH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the most important causative agents of neonatal sepsis. As administration of prophylactic antibiotics during labor can prevent GBS infection, routine screening for this bacterium in prenatal care before the onset of labor is recommended. However, many women present in labor without having undergone such testing during antenatal care, and the turnaround time of detection methods is insufficient for results to be obtained before delivery.

Methods

Vaginal and anorectal specimens were collected from 270 pregnant women. Each sample was tested by Xpert GBS, qPCR, and culture for GBS detection.

Results

The overall prevalence of maternal GBS colonization was 30.7% according to Xpert GBS, 51.1% according to qPCR, and 14.3% according to cultures. Considering the qPCR method as the reference, the Xpert GBS had a sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 93%. Positive Xpert GBS results were correlated to marital status (married or cohabitating) and with prematurity as a cause of neonatal hospitalization. Positive cultures were related with ischemic–hypoxic encephalopathy requiring therapeutic hypothermia.

Conclusions

Combined enrichment/qPCR and the Xpert GBS rapid test found a high prevalence of GBS colonization. The Xpert GBS technique gives faster results and could be useful for evaluating mothers who present without antenatal GBS screening results and are at risk of preterm labor, thus allowing institution of prophylactic antibiotic therapy.

### Every country, every family: time to act for group B streptococcal disease worldwide [^115Yb33M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

To reduce the burden of GBS, high-income countries have primarily relied on intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), with either risk-based screening or universal screening in the third trimester. However, even with high coverage of IAP, this strategy is ineffective to reduce GBS-associated stillbirths, preterm birth, or late-onset GBS, and some cases of early-onset GBS still occur. Crucially, IAP is challenging in LMICs, which bear the highest burden of disease, and if all women colonized with GBS in pregnancy were given antibiotics, this would add millions of doses in an era with concern of rising antimicrobial resistance.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^1145PaT3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study has many strengths. A very high proportion of eligible patients agreed to participate and follow-up rates were high. The approach used to taking swabs and to their subsequent analysis is in accord with current best practice. A more detailed approach to the statistical analysis of the data is presented than has been reported in prior research. The study had the ability to examine the potential impact of a high risk strategy and a screening strategy among the same women. What this study cannot do is provide much needed direct evidence about the relative effectiveness of different strategies in terms of prevention of Early Onset GBS. Such evidence would require the conduct of very large randomised controlled trials which to date have not been seen to be feasible. For this reason, evidence from studies such as this is essential for institutions developing screening policies.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus sepsis after negative screen in a patient taking oral antibiotics [^116P6xrV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of serious neonatal infection. Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced by appropriate prenatal screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Case

A 20-year-old primigravida was treated with oral antibiotics at 35 weeks for a recurrent urinary tract infection. Her GBS screen following the antibiotic treatment showed a negative culture. The patient, therefore, did not receive intravenous antibiotics during her induction of labor for mild preeclampsia. The infant developed early onset neonatal GBS pneumonia and sepsis.

Conclusion

Oral antibiotics can cause a temporary negative culture in a GBS-colonized patient. Relying on a negative culture for management may not be appropriate in a patient treated with oral antibiotics. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of oral antibiotics on GBS.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^114Pteem]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Periviable birth — A recent executive summary defined periviable birth as delivery occurring from 20 0/7 weeks to 25 6/7 weeks of gestation. Approximately 0.5% of all births occur before the third trimester of pregnancy, and these very early deliveries result in the majority of neonatal deaths and more than 40% of infant deaths. Multiple factors have been found to be associated with short-term and long-term outcomes in addition to gestational age, including nonmodifiable factors (eg, fetal sex, weight, plurality), potentially modifiable antepartum and intrapartum factors (eg, location of delivery, intent to intervene by cesarean delivery or induction for delivery, administration of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate), and postnatal management (eg, starting or withholding and continuing or withdrawing intensive care after birth). Antepartum and intrapartum management options vary depending upon circumstances and may include short-term tocolytic therapy for preterm labor to allow time for administration of antenatal steroids, antibiotics to prolong latency after premature rupture of membranes or for intrapartum group B streptococci prophylaxis, and delivery, including cesarean delivery, for concern regarding fetal well-being or fetal malpresentation. Whenever possible, periviable births for which maternal or neonatal intervention is planned should occur in centers that offer expertise in maternal and neonatal care and the needed infrastructure, including intensive care units, to support such services.

### AAP updates guidelines for the management of at-risk infants… [^11269QmK]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Maternal screening for GBS and intrapartum antibiotics for positive screening are important for reducing early-onset GBS disease risk.
- For well-appearing infants born at 35 weeks' gestation or later, determining treatment with a risk calculator and clinical monitoring for 36 to 48 hours are alternatives to empiric antibiotics, even with maternal intrapartum fever. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to all women at delivery who have positive antenatal vaginalrectal cultures for GBS colonization. Also, women with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy, a previous infant with GBS disease, or women in preterm labor or with premature rupture of membranes before 37 weeks' gestation should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Women in labor at 37 weeks' gestation or later who have not been screened for GBS should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis if they develop a temperature of 100.

4°F or higher or rupture membranes and do not deliver for 18 hours or longer. If the result of a point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test is positive for GBS, or if a woman in labor with unknown GBS status had GBS colonization in a previous pregnancy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered. Early-onset GBS antibiotic prophylaxis is effective within two to four hours of administration and penicillin G and ampicillin continue to be recommended for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Cefazolin is recommended for women allergic to penicillin who are at low risk of anaphylaxis. For women allergic to penicillin who are at high risk of anaphylaxis, clindamycin should be administered to those colonized with GBS that is known to be susceptible to clindamycin.

If NAAT results are obtained for an intrapartum patient with unknown GBS status, ACOG recommends that patients receive antibiotic prophylaxis if they have a positive GBS NAAT result or a negative GBS NAAT result with risk factors of gestational age less than 37 weeks, rupture of membranes longer than 18 hours, or maternal fever. A negative GBS NAAT result can eliminate the need for antibiotic prophylaxis if none of these risk factors are present. — Michael Arnold, MD, Medical Editing Fellow.

### Implementation of guidelines for preventing early onset group B streptococcal infection [^114Y7WfM]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Early onset Group B Streptococcus (EOGBS) disease, defined by an onset within the first 72 hours of life, occurs in 1.3 to 3.7 per 1,000 live births. The authors sought to determine the impact of the new CDC/AAP/ACOG guidelines on the prepartum screening practice, intrapartum management, incidence of EOGBS infection, and evaluation of neonates born to GBS colonized women at University Macdonald Women's Hospital (Cleveland, OH). A retrospective analysis by chart review was conducted from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1997 of women identified as GBS colonized during prenatal screening. These women were then divided into 2 groups: period I, women who delivered January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996 (before institutional implementation of the guidelines for management of GBS colonization]; and period II, women who delivered July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1997 after implementation of the guidelines. A chart review was conducted for infants 72 hours old, and GBS culture positive (blood or CSF) for the same time period. In complying with the new screening and treatment guidelines, there was a significant increase in the number of mothers screened and the detection of maternal colonization, plus a 63% reduction in EOGBS. There was also a substantial reduction in the number of invasive procedures on the neonates. The authors conclude that the new guidelines are both medically and economically effective.

### Evaluation of a rapid, real-time intrapartum group B. streptococcus assay [^1163ut2H]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to evaluate an intrapartum nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for group B streptococcus (GBS).

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study of 559 women comparing intrapartum GBS culture with antepartum culture and intrapartum NAAT.

Results

GBS prevalence was 19.5% by antepartum culture and 23.8% by intrapartum culture. Compared with intrapartum culture, antepartum culture had 69.2% sensitivity (60.6–76.9%) and 96.0% specificity (93.7–97.7%). The NAAT demonstrated sensitivity of 90.8% (84.6–95.2%), specificity of 97.6% (95.6–98.8%), and predictive values > 92%. The incidence of discordant cultures was 10.4%. Of the women with negative antepartum and positive intrapartum cultures, only 1 (2.4%) received intrapartum antibiotics. Compared with white women, black (P = 0.02) and Hispanic (P = 0.02) women were more likely to have discordant cultures.

Conclusion

This intrapartum NAAT has excellent characteristics. It may be superior to antepartum culture for detecting intrapartum GBS-allowing more accurate management of laboring mothers and reducing neonatal GBS sepsis.

In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Although universal screening at 35–37 weeks of gestation and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the basis of the prevention strategy, these new guidelines contain important changes for clinical practice. The Committee on Obstetric Practice endorses the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, and recognizes that even complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset group B streptococcal disease.

### Cervical insufficiency: a new issue for guidelines on prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease? [^111h7TfR]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The updated Guidelines on Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, actually represent the mainstay in the prevention of neonatal early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis. According to these guidelines, patients with possible preterm delivery are screened for GBS colonization and offered intrapartum prophylaxis only if they enter preterm labor or experience preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Nonetheless, the fulfillment of these recommendations seems to be suboptimal in clinical practice, as it is heavily influenced by the knowledge of the colonization status. We report here 2 cases of blood culture-proven, early-onset neonatal GBS sepsis involving preterm infants delivered by mothers who had midtrimester cervical insufficiency and bulging membranes. Midtrimester acute cervical insufficiency strongly predicts preterm delivery. These women are liable to miss intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis because they typically have shorter labor, and the test results for GBS status are unlikely to be available before delivery. We believe that women with midtrimester cervical insufficiency and bulging membranes should be screened for GBS infection soon after hospital admittance if the gestational age is close to the threshold of fetal viability. A timely diagnosis of GBS colonization may not only increase the number of patients receiving targeted intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis but would also allow consideration of the administration of antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Indeed, as further outlined in this report, GBS intraamniotic infection may dramatically occur before the onset of preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^1131sBsj]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis and a significant cause of late-onset sepsis among young infants. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is the only currently available effective strategy for the prevention of perinatal GBS early-onset disease, and there is no effective approach for the prevention of late-onset disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics joins with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reaffirm the use of universal antenatal microbiologic-based testing for the detection of maternal GBS colonization to facilitate appropriate administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The purpose of this clinical report is to provide neonatal clinicians with updated information regarding the epidemiology of GBS disease as well current recommendations for the evaluation of newborn infants at risk for GBS disease and for treatment of those with confirmed GBS infection. This clinical report is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), July 2019, and should be construed as ACOG clinical guidance.

### Group B. streptococcus and the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality following term labor [^112i2H5g]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) colonizes the genital tract of approximately 20% of pregnant women. In the absence of intervention, approximately 1% of infants born to colonized mothers exhibit a clinical infection. This has led to implementation of screening and intervention in the form of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in many countries, including the United States. However, screening has not been introduced in a substantial minority of other countries because of the absence of supportive level 1 evidence, the very large number needed to treat to prevent 1 case, and concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Optimal screening would involve rapid turnaround (to facilitate intrapartum testing) and report antibiotic sensitivity, but no such method exists. There is significant scope for a personalized medicine approach, targeting intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to cases at greatest risk, but the pathogen and host factors determining the risk of invasive disease are incompletely understood. Epidemiologic data have indicated the potential of prelabor invasion of the uterus by group B Streptococcus, and metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of group B Streptococcus in the placenta in approximately 5% of pregnant women at term before onset of labor and membrane rupture. However, the determinants and consequences of prelabor invasion of the uterus by group B Streptococcus remain to be established. The vast majority (98%) of invasive neonatal disease is caused by 6 serotypes, and hexavalent vaccines against these serotypes have completed phase 2 trials. However, an obstacle to phase 3 studies is conducting an adequately powered trial to demonstrate clinical effectiveness given that early-onset disease affects approximately 1 in 1000 births in the absence of vaccination.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^117QxipC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease since the 1990s, GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with relevant professional societies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[No. RR-7]); those guidelines were updated and republished in 2002 (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-11]). In June 2009, a meeting of clinical and public health representatives was held to reevaluate prevention strategies on the basis of data collected after the issuance of the 2002 guidelines. This report presents CDC's updated guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology. The recommendations were made on the basis of available evidence when such evidence was sufficient and on expert opinion when available evidence was insufficient. The key changes in the 2010 guidelines include the following:

- expanded recommendations on laboratory methods for the identification of GBS,
- clarification of the colony-count threshold required for reporting GBS detected in the urine of pregnant women,
- updated algorithms for GBS screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes,
- a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis,
- updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and
- a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in substantial reductions in the burden of early-onset GBS disease among newborns. Although early-onset GBS disease has become relatively uncommon in recent years, the rates of maternal GBS colonization (and therefore the risk for early-onset GBS disease in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) remain unchanged since the 1970s. Continued efforts are needed to sustain and improve on the progress achieved in the prevention of GBS disease. There also is a need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens). In the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of early-onset GBS disease prevention.

### Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal group B streptococcal colonization [^111HbKFD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal infection by vertical transmission. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during labor has been associated with a reduction in early onset GBS disease (EOGBSD). However, treating all colonized women during labor exposes a large number of women and infants to possible adverse effects without benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effect of IAP for maternal GBS colonization on neonatal: 1) all cause mortality and 2) morbidity from proven and probable EOGBSD, late onset GBS disease (LOD), maternal infectious outcomes and allergic reactions to antibiotics.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials assessing the impact of maternal IAP on neonatal GBS infections were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies.

Main Results

Three trials (involving 852 women) evaluating the effects of IAP versus no treatment were included. The risk of bias was high. The use of IAP did not significantly reduce the incidence of all cause mortality, mortality from GBS infection or from infections caused by bacteria other than GBS. The incidence of early GBS infection was reduced with IAP compared to no treatment (risk ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.74, three trials, 488 infants; risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; number needed to treat to benefit 25, 95% CI 14 to 100, I(2) 0%). The incidence of LOD or sepsis from organisms other than GBS and puerperal infection was not significantly different between groups. One trial (involving 352 women) compared intrapartum ampicillin versus penicillin and reported no significant difference in neonatal or maternal outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce EOGBSD, but this result may well be a result of bias as we found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution. There is lack of evidence from well designed and conducted trials to recommend IAP to reduce neonatal EOGBSD. Ideally the effectiveness of IAP to reduce neonatal GBS infections should be studied in adequately sized double-blind controlled trials. The opportunity to conduct such trials has likely been lost, as practice guidelines (albeit without good evidence) have been introduced in many jurisdictions.

36 weeks — Group B streptococcus screening — antenatal screening is recommended for all pregnant patients between 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks, except for patients identified as candidates for GBS prophylaxis based on urine culture or a prior affected infant; a single vaginal and rectal swab should be used for culture, and antibiotics should be initiated in labor for patients who screen positive; samples may be provider- or patient self-collected; GBS culture is highly predictive within 5 weeks, and repeat screening should be considered if more than 5 weeks elapse before labor.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^1111aazN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Analysis of the test characteristics associated with different screening schedules was undertaken for the subset of 600 (69%) study participants for whom complete data were available from testing at 32 weeks and 36 weeks gestation as well as in labour (Table 3). Analysis of the use of a risk factor protocol was undertaken for the 699 participants for whom a labour swab was taken (Table 3). It was apparent that tests at 36 weeks were more sensitive and had higher negative predictive values and lower Likelihood Ratio negative values than tests at 32 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in specificity, positive predictive value or Likelihood Ratio positive values associated with the timing of screening. Having a positive perianal or low vaginal swab – the more inclusive definition, was a more sensitive test than low vaginal swab alone but with a trade-off in terms of specificity and positive predictive value. There was no statistical difference in the Likelihood Ratio positive, but Likelihood Ratio negative was lower using the more inclusive definition of positivity (Table 4). Classifying women as being at high risk was not sensitive (Table 3) and was not informative in predicting GBS status during labour (Likelihood ratio tests were not different than 1).

### Screening pregnant women for group B. streptococcus infection between 30 and 32 weeks of pregnancy in a population at high risk for premature birth [^11677r52]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the benefits of a chemoprophylaxis program based on screening women for group B streptococcus (GBS) infection between 30 and 32 weeks of pregnancy in a population with a high rate of premature births.

Methods

From 1995 to 2011, 24 950 women were screened for GBS infection between 30 and 32 weeks of pregnancy at Markusovszky Teaching Hospital, Szombathely, Hungary. Those who tested positive, and those who tested negative but were at risk of infecting their newborns, underwent intrapartum prophylaxis. Neonatal outcomes were compared with those of a historical cohort that underwent no screening or treatment, and with those published in CDC/ACOG guidelines recommending screening closer to term.

Results

There were 63 infected newborns (0.2%) in the study cohort, and 1 of 8 with sepsis died. There were 149 infected newborns (0.7%) in the historical cohort, and 29 of 31 with sepsis died.

Conclusion

Screening women early in a population with a high rate of premature births may simplify preterm labor management. It results, however, in a higher incidence of early onset neonatal GBS disease than when screening is done closer to term.

### Women's knowledge of and attitudes towards group B. streptococcus (GBS) testing in pregnancy: a qualitative study [^115zcbvz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Respondents wanted to the information to be explained by health professionals who could discuss it with them and answer their questions, in line with previous studies. However, the experiences of women in the current study suggest that health professionals do not always provide sufficient information. A study which explored physician awareness found that, although they had good knowledge of GBS, half wanted additional training about testing.

The majority of women had positive attitudes towards the offer of GBS testing. It was seen as 'just another procedure' that was part of pregnancy. Most thought that such an offer increased informed choice, allows preparation in case of a positive result and it would lower the risk of their baby being affected by EOGBS because it could be managed effectively. A few respondents, expressed concerns about testing questioning the invasiveness of the procedure and whether there were risks to themselves or the baby. As well as the possible iatrogenic effects of receiving prophylactic antibiotics. These concerns are very similar to those found in research looking at women's views on a GBS vaccine. In addition, there were concerns both that the offer might increase anxiety in women who were subsequently found to be negative or that some may feel clinical and social pressure to agree to being tested when they would prefer not to. For those women who had planned or had water births or home births there was concern that GBS testing might affect their choice of type of birth and place of birth (e.g. home, midwifery-led unit, hospital), and, consequently, increase risks of iatrogenic harm for them or their babies.

### ACOG committee opinion: number 279, December 2002. prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in newborns [^116iuTJo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

During the past two decades, group B streptococci (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, has emerged as an important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Intrapartum administration of antibiotics to the woman (during labor or after rupture of membranes, but before delivery) has been demonstrated to reduce early-onset neonatal GBS disease. In 1996, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that obstetric providers adopt either a culture-based or a risk-based approach for the prevention of early-onset GBS. A recent multistate retrospective cohort study of live births in 1998 and 1999 of residents from eight areas of the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance/Emerging Infections Program network suggests that the culture-based approach is superior to the risk-based approach. The Committee on Obstetric Practice supports the new CDC recommendations that obstetric providers adopt a culture-based strategy for the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in the newborn. It is important to acknowledge that complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset GBS.

### Real-time PCR assay provides reliable assessment of intrapartum carriage of group B. streptococcus [^112r4Cnf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of the real-time PCR assay for determining the group B Streptococcus (GBS) status of women in labor. In this prospective study we compared the results of culture and PCR testing of vaginal and rectal samples collected by nursing staff when women were in labor. Patients' charts were also reviewed to obtain relevant information about pregnancy risk factors. Our results demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5%, 96.1%, 86.4%, and 97.4%, respectively, for rapid PCR. Of the 196 women evaluated, 29 (14.8%) presented with unknown GBS status, 11 (37.9%) of whom received unnecessary intrapartum antibiotics. The rapid real-time PCR test was robust and was able to reliably detect the presence of GBS in women in labor within 1 h of specimen submission to the laboratory. We recommend that the rapid PCR test be targeted to women who present in labor with unknown GBS status. In cases where the laboratory does not offer 24-h availability of testing, sample collection followed by PCR testing the next morning is still valuable and provides reliable results 24 to 48 h faster than culture and will aid appropriate decision-making regarding continuing or stopping antibiotics for neonates of women with unknown GBS status.

Guidelines for infants exposed to less than 4 hours of IAP

Scasso et al used GBS positive rectovaginal swabs taken during labour before IAP and 2 and 4 hours after IAP administration to conclude that 4 hours of IAP was needed for the purposes of neonatal management. Other previous studies evaluated the efficacy of intrapartum beta-lactam given less than 4 hours before birth by examining skin or pharynx GBS colonisation of the infants. However, these are only surrogate markers for invasive GBS infection.

Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) GBS prevention guidelineconsiders asymptomatic infants at risk if born to mothers colonised with GBS and received less than 4 hours of IAP based on previous studies. However, investigations of the reasons behind the infants receiving < 4 hours of IAP are lacking.

The CDC's GBS prevention guideline from 2002recommended that infants with < 4 hours of IAP exposure should be evaluated with a blood culture and complete blood count immediately after birth. However, in the revised version from 2010, well-appearing infants with less than 4 hours of IAP exposure can be managed by in-hospital observation for at least 48 hours after birth. For infants with known risk factors of EOGBS, limited evaluation and observation for at least 48 hours are still recommended. National guidelines now incorporate the increasing use of intrapartum GBS PCR testing and in 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics outlined three approaches to risk assessment for infants born at or after 35 weeks which all imply 36–48 hours of observation.

In infants, several preconditions may influence measures of antibiotic concentrations. These include gestational age, weight and body surface area. Immature renal clearance that can increase the half-life of the given antibiotic and the rate of placental transfer may be reasons for the high concentrations found among infants exposed to only one dose of IAP along with the fact that the first maternal dose is 3 g whereas the following doses are 1.5 g. Based on the studies by Barber et al and Berardi et al, a review by Berardi et al concludes that there is no reason to suppose a lower effect of short IAP duration when the entire loading dose has been administered.

### Avoiding inadequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococci [^116bFgKw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the frequency and reasons for inadequate group B streptococci (GBS) prophylaxis at our institution and to estimate what proportion of cases can be avoided with perfect protocol adherence.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of neonates born to GBS-colonized women who received inadequate prophylaxis between April 30, 2013, and May 1, 2014. The maternal chart was analyzed to categorize each case as avoidable (adequate time on labor and delivery to receive antibiotics 4 hours before birth and β-lactam antibiotic-eligible) or unavoidable and to determine whether a violation of the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol (delayed or incorrect antibiotics) occurred.

Results

A total of 197 of 488 (40.4%, 95% confidence interval 36.1–44.8%) newborns of group B-colonized women received inadequate prophylaxis. Of these, 157 cases (79.7%, 73.4–84.8%) were unavoidable and would have occurred even with perfect protocol adherence. The 40 (20.3%, 15.3–26.5%) avoidable cases due to protocol violations resulted from delayed antibiotic administration (first dose of antibiotics more than 1 hour after admission [median 9.33 hours, range 3.83–25 hours] in 25 patients; no antibiotics in four patients; total 29 patients, 72.5%) or incorrect antibiotic selection (11 patients, 27.5%).

Conclusions

Forty percent of patients received inadequate prophylaxis, and four of five cases are unavoidable with our current labor management and the 2010 CDC guidelines. Timeliness and selection of antibiotics remain areas for improvement, but the overall effects on sepsis prevention will be modest.

### Rapid intrapartum test for maternal group B streptococcal colonisation and its effect on antibiotic use in labouring women with risk factors for early-onset neonatal infection (GBS2): cluster randomised trial with nested test accuracy study [^113zPnoA]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram-positive pathogen found in the gut and genital tract of one in five women; a third of these women pass the bacteria to their baby during pregnancy or labour. Most babies colonised with GBS are asymptomatic. GBS is one of the leading causes of early-onset neonatal infection, with a global pooled incidence rate of 0.49 per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 0.56) and disproportionately high mortality and morbidity. In the UK and Ireland, at least two babies are diagnosed every day with GBS infection (at 0–90 days); one baby dies every week, and one survives with long-term disability.

In order to prevent neonatal early-onset GBS infection, pregnant women colonised with GBS are offered antibiotics intrapartum, ideally at least 4 h before childbirth. Many countries, such as the USA, have national screening programmes that use culture-based tests to identify women colonised with GBS in late pregnancy. But culture-based tests at 35–37 weeks of gestation have limited accuracy in predicting the maternal GBS colonisation status in labour, take up to 48 h to produce a result, and are likely to be missed in women who go into labour preterm.

Some high-income countries, including the UK, remain uncertain about the balance between the benefits and harms of universal screening, and instead rely on a risk-based approach, where all women with risk factors are offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS infection in their babies. Neonates are closely monitored for signs of infection and administered antibiotics if there is a diagnosis or suspicion of sepsis. Since only a third of women with risk factors are colonised with GBS, a large proportion of women and their babies are unnecessarily exposed to antibiotics. Rapid and accurate determination of the GBS colonisation status of the mother in labour can enable targeted administration of antibiotics in a timely fashion and reduce needless exposure to antibiotics in mothers whose babies maybe considered to be at risk of infection, but where the labouring mother is not actually colonised.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^115CHonN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Periviable birth — obstetric interventions and evidence scope: Obstetric interventions often considered include treatments to delay delivery and efforts to improve newborn outcomes should delivery occur despite such efforts, and options may include short-term tocolytic therapy for preterm labor to allow additional time for administration of antenatal steroids, emergent cerclage, antibiotics to prolong latency after preterm PROM or for intrapartum group B streptococci prophylaxis, and delivery (including cesarean delivery) for concern regarding fetal well-being or fetal malpresentation. Data regarding the use of obstetric interventions during the periviable period, especially for gestational ages less than 24 weeks, are limited, and most recommendations for management are extrapolated from data available for women who gave birth between 26 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation. Guidance is based on a mix of direct evidence, data extrapolated from more advanced gestational ages, and expert opinion.

### Perinatal infections due to group B streptococci [^111u8o38]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci (GBS) emerged dramatically in the 1970s as the leading cause of neonatal infection and as an important cause of maternal uterine infection. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapy of GBS perinatal infection. In 1996, the first national consensus guidelines were released. Since then, there has been a 70% reduction in early-onset neonatal GBS infection, but no decrease in late-onset neonatal GBS disease. In 2002, new national guidelines were released recommending 1) solely a screen-based prevention strategy, 2) a new algorithm for patients with penicillin allergy, and 3) more specific practices in certain clinical scenarios. Yet many clinical issues remain, including implementation of new diagnostic techniques, management of preterm rupture of membranes, use of alternative antibiotic approaches, improvement of compliance, prevention of low birth weight infants, emergence of resistant organisms, and vaccine development.

IAP administration

Pregnant women with threatened preterm labor, risks of preterm delivery such as multiple births or premature rupture of membranes could be collected vaginal-rectal swabs for GBS culture before 35 weeks of gestation. And all other pregnant women were screened for GBS at 35–37 weeks of gestation. At the time of labor or rupture of membranes, IAP should be given to women who tested positive for GBS colonization. If GBS culture results were unknown at the time of delivery onset, women at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation, had a duration of membrane rupture ≥ 18 h, or had a temperature of ≥ 100.4º F (≥ 38.0ºC) were also treated with IAP. Once the GBS status were available prior to delivery and were negative, the GBS prophylaxis would be discontinued, otherwise IAP administration would be continued until their delivery. However, there were 90 culture-confirmed GBS-positive pregnant women were not administrated with IAP in time or more than 4 h. IAP agents and dosage were applied to patients according to the guidelines released by the CDC. An initial dose of 4.8 million U of penicillin were given to GBS culture-positive women at the time of labor onset via intravenous injection, followed by 2.4 million U of penicillin at an interval of 4 h. Pregnant women with premature rupture of membranes were intravenously injected with an initial dose of 2 g ampicillin, followed by 1 g ampicillin at an interval of 4 h. Penicillin-allergic women could be administrated with cefazolin or clindamycin.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^112aSUnu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Low vaginal swabs, perinanal, or combined?

The use of both low vaginal swabs and perianal swabs identifies a higher proportion of colonised women. Whether in fact this higher antepartum detection rate will contribute to lower rates of neonatal infection and morbidity has yet to be determined. The additional costs of such an approach would need to be examined to determine whether hospital guidelines should be altered.

There is variability in screening practices in clinical practice nationally and worldwide. The companion paper from this study reporting the results of qualitative interviews with participants highlights that pregnant women are keen to do everything possible to ensure that they have a healthy liveborn infant and, that swabbing is not seen as particularly intrusive. Although these women expressed little concern about the potential adverse effects of antibiotic use such concern is an appropriate one for healthcare workers.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117CjqAr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### High prevalence of group B. streptococcus colonization among pregnant women in amman, Jordan [^111XwzT1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no established international standards for sampling GBS colonization; however, CDC recommends rectovaginal swabs at 35–37 weeks with selective enrichment broth culture, but this approach is not always feasible for low and middle-income settings. Additional barriers to routine testing in these low resource settings may include the lack of microbiology capacity to perform routine testing for GBS, lack of timely knowledge of the results being reported back to the clinicians because of separate settings where prenatal care is performed and where lab testing would be performed, and lack of electronic medical records for the obstetricians to obtain antenatal results. One way to address these issues is the introduction of point-of-care testing when women present in labor. Unfortunately, the rapid diagnostic used in this pilot study was substantially less sensitive and specific than culture. Furthermore, over one-quarter of women who received an intrapartum antibiotic due to a positive rapid GBS antigen test (11/43, 25.6%) were found later to be GBS culture-negative, leading to unnecessary use of antibiotics. Our GBS antigen test results were poorer than other studies using other antigen-based tests that yielded 57.3% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity in Canada and 100% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity in India. Other point-of-care testing methods such as PCR testing have been reported to have high sensitivity (92.9–100%) and specificity (81.1–97.5%) and may be a better solution. However, these higher-performing tests typically are cost-prohibitive for lower-resource settings, and further development of affordable point-of-care GBS tests are urgently needed, particularly those that also simultaneously provide information about antibiotic sensitivities.

GBS has 10 known serotypes; however, five (Ia, Ib, II, III, and V) colonize the rectovaginal tracts of women in all regions, accounting for 98% of serotypes globally. Moreover, these five serotypes represent 97% of invasive isolates in all regions with serotype data, with serotype III the most prevalent serotype across the United Nations sub-regions. Our study also identified serotype III as the most prevalent, followed by Ia and II serotypes. This is similar to other studies that report serotype III as the first- or second-most common isolate colonizing women. Knowing which serotypes are most widespread will be important when GBS conjugate vaccines become available. Therefore, further studies are needed to know which serotypes are responsible for both colonization and invasive neonatal disease in the MENA region, including Jordan.

### Early-onset group B streptococcal disease in the United States: potential for further reduction [^113rsEu8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe lapses in adherence to group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention guidelines among cases of early-onset GBS disease in term and preterm neonates and to estimate the potential for further reduction in disease burden under current prevention strategies.

Methods

We reviewed labor and delivery and prenatal records of mothers of neonates with early-onset GBS disease (aged younger than 7 days with GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) identified at population-based surveillance sites in 2008–2009. We interviewed prenatal care providers about GBS screening practices and obtained relevant laboratory records. We evaluated the data for errors in prenatal screening, laboratory methods, communication of results, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Using published data on screening sensitivity and intrapartum prophylaxis effectiveness, we estimated the potential reduction in cases under optimal prevention implementation.

Results

Among 309 cases, 179 (57.9%) had one or more implementation errors. The most common error type in term and preterm case-patients was prenatal screening (80 of 222 [36.0%]) and intrapartum prophylaxis (46 of 85 [54.1%]), respectively. We estimated that under optimal implementation, cases of early-onset GBS disease could be reduced by 26–59% with the largest benefit from a single intervention coming from improved use of intrapartum prophylaxis (16% decrease).

Conclusion

Further reduction of early-onset GBS disease burden is possible under current prevention strategies, particularly with improved implementation of antibiotic prophylaxis. However, even with perfect adherence to recommended practices, the decline in cases may be modest. Therefore, novel prevention approaches such as improved intrapartum assays and vaccines are also needed.

### Association between group B. streptococcus and clinical chorioamnionitis by gestational week at delivery – A multicenter cohort study [^113woW9x]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the era of group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), GBS colonization has been associated with a lower risk of chorioamnionitis, possibly due to a protective effect of IAP. We sought to confirm this finding and assess whether this association varies by gestational week at delivery.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study of term (37.0–42.6 weeks), singleton parturients with known GBS status who delivered from 2005 to 2021 at two academic medical centers in Israel. We excluded patients who underwent planned cesarean, out of hospital birth, or had a fetal demise. Patients received GBS screening and IAP for GBS positivity as routine clinical care. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis as determined by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision code, compared between GBS-positive and -negative groups, and assessed by gestational week at delivery.

Results

Of 292,126 deliveries, 155,255 met inclusion criteria. In total, 30.1% were GBS positive and 69.9% were negative. GBS-positive patients were 21% less likely to be diagnosed with clinical chorioamnionitis than GBS-negative patients, even after controlling for confounders (1.5 vs. 2.2%, adjusted odds ratio: 0.79, 95% confidence interval: 0.68–0.92). When assessed by gestational week at delivery, there was a significantly greater difference in rates of clinical chorioamnionitis between GBS-positive versus GBS-negative groups with advancing gestational age: 1.5-fold difference at 38 to 40 weeks, but a twofold difference at 42 weeks. The risk of clinical chorioamnionitis remained stable in the GBS-positive group, but increased significantly in the GBS-negative group at 41- and 42-week gestation (2.0 vs. 2.9%, p < 0.01 at 41 weeks; up to 3.9% at 42 weeks, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

In a large multicenter cohort with universal GBS screening and IAP, GBS positivity was associated with a lower risk of chorioamnionitis, driven by an increasing rate of chorioamnionitis among GBS-negative patients after 40 weeks.

Key Points

· GBS positivity and IAP may be associated with lower risk of chorioamnionitis. · GBS-positive patients were less likely to be diagnosed with chorioamnionitis. · This difference increased with advancing gestational age after 40 weeks.

### Prenatal antibiotic treatment does not decrease group B. streptococcus colonization at delivery [^1114MEPN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether an outpatient antibiotic regimen decreased group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization to preclude the use of intrapartum antibiotics.

Methods

A double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluating prenatal oral amoxicillin versus placebo with the primary outcome of GBS colonization at the time of labor.

Results

Of those patients receiving both amoxicillin and a repeat culture at the time of labor, 6 of the 14 (43%) tested positive for GBS colonization. Given persistent GBS colonization of 67% (10/15) in the placebo group, treatment with amoxicillin did not significantly impact colonization at the time of delivery (P = 0.20).

Conclusion

A regimen of outpatient amoxicillin was associated with persistent GBS colonization in 43% of women at the time of labor. Oral prenatal antibiotic prophylaxis against GBS does not sufficiently reduce colonization to preclude intrapartum intravenous antibiotics.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 797 [^115yg5Ga]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of newborn infection. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal colonization of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis. Obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. This Committee Opinion, including Table 1, Box 2, and Figures 1–3, updates and replaces the obstetric components of the CDC 2010 guidelines, "Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: Revised Guidelines From CDC, 2010".

### Diagnostic accuracy of a rapid real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for universal intrapartum group B. streptococcus screening [^112Ne69h]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is currently given to mothers who test positive for group B streptococcus (GBS) by antenatal culture-based screening, with a risk-based approach for cases with an unknown GBS status. A rapid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of GBS became available recently, making intrapartum screening possible. We aimed to assess its diagnostic accuracy and to compare it with antenatal screening.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study in a French hospital. All pregnant women giving birth at the maternity ward were considered for inclusion, except those with planned cesarean delivery, with delivery at < 35 weeks gestation, and who received antibiotic therapy before admission. We performed GBS culture (the reference standard) and a molecular GBS test (Xpert GBS; Cepheid) on intrapartum specimens. Decisions about intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis were based on the current GBS screening by culture at 35–37 weeks gestation.

Results

We prospectively enrolled 968 pregnant women from April 2007 through March 2008. The overall molecular GBS test yield was 89.2%. Among the 863 women with available results, the molecular GBS test had a sensitivity of 98.5%, specificity of 99.6%, positive predictive value of 97.8%, and negative predictive value of 99.7%. The positive predictive value of antenatal culture for identifying colonization status at delivery was low (58.3%), whereas the negative predictive value was imperfect (92.1%).

Conclusions

This real-time PCR assay is a highly accurate test to identify intrapartum GBS carriers at point of care. This new tool could enhance the exact identification of candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, including women with preterm rupture of membranes or preterm labor.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^112QC2ar]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Policies for GBS screening vary among countries, with some offering universal screening (eg, through microbiological testing) to all pregnant women and others undertaking this selectively. In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations have been to offer IAP to women identified as having the following risk factors for GBS: previous baby with invasive GBS infection, GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy, vaginal or rectal swab positive for GBS in the current pregnancy, or maternal intrapartum pyrexia above 38°C. However, the recent national surveillance study showed that only 35% of a cohort of 429 UK and Irish cases with EOGBS disease had 1 or more of these risk factors compared to 65% in the 2000–2001 study. Since this surveillance was undertaken, the RCOG guidelines have been updated (in 2017). These revised guidelines now include preterm labor as an additional risk factor for the offer of IAP and a recommendation for women who have previously had a positive GBS result to either be treated as a carrier in the current pregnancy or to offer repeat testing and IAP if appropriate. This could potentially add up to 12% more women to the proportion who might be offered IAP. Nevertheless, a risk factor–based approach provides only limited protection against invasive EOGBS disease in the infant.

In around half of high-income countries, women who are not already identified as at increased risk of their baby developing EOGBS are offered a test for GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks of gestation ("universal screening"), with subsequent IAP for those whose swab is positive for GBS (around 18%–20%). Both the risk-based and universal screening approaches entail giving IAP to a substantial proportion of pregnant women, the great majority of whom would not have had an affected baby even without the IAP.

Further uncertainties exist in how best to detect those infants at risk of both EOGBS and LOGBS infection. Current test-based screening is developed to identify maternal GBS colonization rather than neonatal or infant invasive disease. The risk factors used to identify women who should be offered IAP are generic clinical risk factors and are not sensitive or specific for EOGBS.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^111aA1b4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection in infants as a consequence of vertically acquired infection, is an important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity, presenting as sepsis or pneumonia. The incidence of early onset group B streptococcus sepsis (EOGBS) occurring within the first week of life has fallen in Australia from 2.0 per 1000 live births in 1991–1993 to 0.5 per 1000 live births in 1995–1997. This figure is similar to the recently reported annual incidence of 0.48 per 1000 from the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Vaginal colonisation occurs in 11–30% of all pregnant women and 50–75% of their infants become colonised usually during labour or birth. There is clear evidence that intrapartum colonisation is strongly associated with EOGBS sepsis which has a case-fatality of approximately 4%. Serious morbidities include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.

The United States' Centers for Disease Control has endorsed a strategy in which screening of pregnant women is to occur at 35–37 weeks gestation using vaginal and rectal swabs and all women delivering before 37 weeks are to be treated if they are of GBS culture positive or of unknown GBS status, a change from their previous policy in which a strategy of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis based on a risk-based approach also was endorsed. This contrasts with the 2003 recommendation from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which states that "routine screening (either bacteriological or risk based) for antenatal GBS carriage is not recommended". There is no standard accepted approach to the prevention of EOGBS. Strategies have evolved including screening antenatally to detect colonisation or treatment of women with risk factors including prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, preterm labour and history of maternal colonisation during pregnancy reflecting in part, the impact of local data on the burden of GBS.

SCREENING APPROACHES FOR GBS

Two main approaches to screening pregnant women are widely practiced in high- and middle-income settings: universal screening or risk factor based–screening. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society for Microbiology, and American College of Nurse-Midwives have recommended IAP to prevent EOGBS since the early 1990s. Following a large multicenter cohort study in 2002 that suggested universal screening to be superior to risk-based screening, US guidance recommended universal screening (using a vaginal and a rectal swab) for GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks of gestation and among women with threatened preterm delivery and unknown colonization status, in addition to administration of high-dose intravenous benzylpenicillin or ampicillin in labor in those with a positive GBS swab. Additional risk factors for which IAP may be offered include women with GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy, a previous infant with GBS disease, vaginal or rectal swab positive for GBS in the current or a previous pregnancy, women with unknown colonization status, and intrapartum risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes or maternal intrapartum pyrexia above 38°C. In the United Kingdom, clinical risk factor screening (as outlined above, with the addition of preterm labor) is performed. Since the introduction of IAP policies, culture-confirmed EOGBS disease in the United States declined from 1.7 per 1000 live births in the 1990s to 0.21 per 1000 live births in 2015.

The use of clinical risk factor–based IAP strategies rather than universal screening is based on the belief that the introduction of routine microbiological screening may not reduce EOGBS-related mortality and morbidity sufficiently to be cost-effective. The recent National Screening Committee report assessing GBS screening expressed serious concern that it was not clear whether benefits associated with screening outweighed the harms for the majority of the population and that large numbers of women would be offered and take antibiotics when they do not need to, increasing potential risks associated with widespread antibiotic use in both women and infants. A UK test accuracy study found that only 28.9% (89/307) of women with clinical risk factors actually carried GBS (whether tested by rapid intrapartum polymerase chain reaction [PCR]–based methods or following enriched culture medium of swabs in late pregnancy) and that 19% (205/1080) of women with no clinical risk factors carried GBS.

Procedures in rapid test and usual care units

Maternity units randomised to the rapid test received a GeneXpert® Dx IV GBS rapid testing system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) and a supply of XpertGBS test cartridges. Trained clinical midwives obtained vaginal and rectal maternal samples using a double-headed swab. One swab was used immediately for the rapid test according to the manufacturer's instructions, and a result was obtained in less than 55 min. If the rapid test had not been initiated on the GeneXpert machine within 15 min of taking the swab, the test was considered invalid. The other swab was used for the diagnostic test accuracy study.

The rapid test units were advised to go against national guidelines, and only women who tested positive for GBS with the rapid test or for whom a test result was not available were to be offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, unless there was a clinical reason for prescribing antibiotics, or if the woman requested antibiotics.

If the woman had not given birth 48 h after the test result was available, the test result was regarded as invalid, and it was advised that the woman should be re-swabbed and retested for GBS colonisation.

Usual care units followed their standard risk-based screening strategy where intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was offered to all women with risk factors.

The recommended antibiotic regimen for preventing early-onset neonatal GBS infection in both types of units in the study was in line with national recommendations, where benzyl penicillin is the first-choice antibiotic for GBS prophylaxsis. Subsequent clinical management of mother and baby was based on local guidance.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of women with risk factors who received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent neonatal early-onset GBS infection. The secondary maternal outcomes were intrapartum maternal antibiotic administration for any indication, indications other than Caesarean section, any postpartum maternal antibiotic use and exposure to antibiotics for greater than 2 or 4 h before delivery. The neonatal outcomes were the proportion of newborns who receive antibiotics for any indication, with suspected or diagnosed early-onset sepsis requiring antibiotics and neonatal mortality at any time until discharge from the hospital. We also reported serious adverse events in the mother or newborn.

To decrease risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis from group B streptococcus (GBS), pregnant patients should undergo screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks' gestation. Patients with a positive vaginal-rectal culture, GBS bacteriuria, or history of newborn with GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) with an agent targeting GBS. If GBS status is unknown at time of labor, IAP should be administered in cases of preterm birth, rupture of membranes for > 18 hours, or intrapartum fever. The antibiotic of choice is intravenous penicillin; alternatives should be considered in cases of penicillin allergy depending on allergy severity.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^116aT4vF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of mothers with antenatally diagnosed GBS colonization who received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and delivered a live born neonate at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, from January 1, 2005 to March 2, 2018. All potentially eligible individuals were identified through a query of hospital electronic medical records (EMR). This study period was chosen as there were no significant changes to the EMR system during this time interval. We systematically identified patients with known GBS colonization during pregnancy by searching templated labor and delivery admission notes that routinely document the result of a known GBS culture (rectovaginal or urine) and laboratory results, and only included individuals who had a known positive GBS result. Antibiotic susceptibility results from positive GBS culture were not available. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years of age, received at least one intrapartum dose of an antibiotic for the indication of GBS prophylaxis, and if they delivered a live born singleton infant at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation. This gestational age threshold was chosen because institutional protocol requires neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission for all neonates born at < 35 weeks of gestation. Patients were excluded if they were suspected to have intrapartum chorioamnionitis because it was institutional practice during the study period for their neonates to routinely have blood draws to assess complete blood count (CBC) and blood cultures, and to receive at least 24 h of IV antibiotics or until the blood tests resulted. Chorioamnionitis was defined by the presence of billing diagnosis codes ICD-9 658.4 (Infection of amniotic cavity) or ICD-10 O41.1 (Infection of amniotic sac and membranes), or the presence of the diagnosis of "chorioamnionitis/sepsis" in the templated delivery note, or the presence of an intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4 F and the administration of therapeutic doses of antibiotic agents typically used to treat chorioamnionitis (i.e. ampicillin and gentamicin). Lastly, mother-neonate dyads for whom exposure or outcome data were missing were excluded.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^113BQxKG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In autumn 2016, the UK Department of Health (now Department of Health and Social Care) convened 2 meetings to discuss how to address research evidence gaps in order to minimize the impact of infant group B streptococcus (GBS) disease in the United Kingdom. At that meeting, a number of research priorities were highlighted, including improving the screening for GBS colonization in pregnant women, offering intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and point-of-care testing, and understanding the effect of widespread intrapartum antibiotic use on long-term infant health. Further discussions involved investigating the feasibility of a large prospective study of pregnant women and their infants in order to understand the role of antibodies in the protection against GBS disease in infancy following maternal exposure to GBS colonization. Here, we summarize the research uncertainties identified at that meeting.

### Clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive group B. streptococcus disease among infants, China [^113GS948]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study identified a lower fatality rate (2.3%) than observed globally in a meta-analysis (8.4%; 95% CI 6.6%–10.2%), which could reflect early detection of suspected GBS and timely management with antimicrobial drugs. Also, we found that only 5.6% of surviving infants across all participating hospitals had neurologic sequelae at discharge. However, this value could be an underestimate because we did not use a standard assessment across sites and sequelae might not be obvious in infants. Further investigation in longer term follow-up studies in China are warranted to quantify the residual burden of neurologic sequelae in infants with invasive GBS disease.

Given that maternal GBS colonization is the primary risk factor for EOD, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines recommending intravenous intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during labor to prevent EOD in infants born to women colonized with GBS or with risk factors. The IAP policy, along with universal screening, was shown to decrease EOD incidence but did not decrease LOD incidence. However, 37% of low- to middle-income countries, including China, have not implemented the IAP program on a systematic basis, and China currently does not have specific recommendations or guidelines for preventing GBS. During 2015–2017, eighteen hospitals in this study reported only 13.2% of GBS case-mothers received GBS screening before delivery. Currently, not every hospital has a GBS screening program. Some hospitals offer optional GBS screening, but patients must cover the cost, and screening is not covered by any medical insurance. We also have seen previously that surveyed pregnant women thought GBS incidence was low and most chose not to have GBS screening (W. Ji, H. Liu, and Y. Fang, unpub. data).

Discussion

Despite the CDC's recommendation to treat penicillin allergic pregnant individuals with cefazolin for GBS prophylaxis, the majority (73.7%) of patients with a documented penicillin allergy in our cohort were treated with clindamycin or vancomycin, both considered alternative treatment for GBS prophylaxis. This is consistent with prior smaller studies that have showed obstetric care providers have an insufficient understanding of appropriate antibiotic selection for GBS prophylaxis in penicillin allergic patients. Our findings in this large study demonstrates a notable deviation from a well-established best practice guideline and has several concerning implications, particularly relating to effects of poor antibiotic stewardship and rising antimicrobial resistance rates. GBS resistance to clindamycin is already a significant problem, with the CDC reporting 47.3% of isolates to be resistant. The most recent update in 2019 to the ACOG guideline addresses this by now only recommending the use of clindamycin for GBS prophylaxis when a culture is obtained and shows a susceptible strain. This illustrates how effective antibiotic choices and reliability of empiric therapy are decreasing over time. The improper use of clindamycin and vancomycin also leads to broader antimicrobial coverage than indicated (e.g. anaerobic coverage with clindamycin) and may have effects on the maternal and perhaps perinatally-acquired neonatal microbiome. Broader coverage may also lead to increased antibiotic resistance among other common colonizing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (rising clindamycin resistance rates) and enterococcus species (e.g. vancomycin resistant enterococcus). Furthermore, compared to beta-lactam antibiotics, alternative antibiotics are more costly and more toxic, with increased risks for maternal nephrotoxicity and Clostridium difficile infections.

Our study also showed that the use of clindamycin and vancomycin for GBS prophylaxis had consequences for the newborn during the study period. Neonates of mothers who received clindamycin or vancomycin had an increased rate of blood draws (specifically, CBC and blood culture) compared to neonates of mothers who received penicillin or cefazolin. These lab draws would likely not have been medically indicated if their mothers had received first-line GBS prophylaxis during labor. Venous blood draws are distressing both to the infant and parents and should be avoided whenever possible. Although as of 2019, enhanced clinical is recommended for infants born > 35 weeks gestational age to mothers who received inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis rather than routine laboratory evaluation, the study illustrates deviation from "routine neonatal care" if alternative antibiotics without equal efficacy data for neonatal sepsis prevention are utilized.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^115QiyDh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity from neonatal sepsis. GBS colonises the gastrointestinal and/or genitourinary tract in 10 to 30% of pregnant women, with a recent global rate of 17.9%. If a pregnant woman is vaginally colonised with GBS when she is in labour, there is a 36% chance that GBS will be transmitted to her neonate. Most GBS colonised neonates will be asymptomatic, however less than 1% may suffer from invasive early-onset GBS disease (less than seven days, EOGBS). Globally, culture-confirmed EOGBS has an estimated incidence of 0.43 per 1000 live births and a case fatality rate of 12.1%, which may be an underestimate.

To prevent EOGBS, the currently available prevention is intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), administered to mothers identified at risk of vertically transmitting GBS bacteria. The current recommendation for IAP in Western Europe, North America, and Australasia is intravenous penicillin (or ampicillin) given as soon as possible after the onset of labour and then every four hours until delivery, with intravenous cefazolin in the US, or clindamycin in the UK, for mothers allergic to penicillin. Pregnant women are selected to be offered IAP using different policies. In some countries, women are offered IAP if they present with known risk factors for GBS, such as intrapartum fever or GBS bacteriuria, and in many other countries, women are actively screened for GBS colonisation at 35–37 weeks of pregnancy and treated in labour if they are positive. Screening for GBS maternal colonisation is controversial as up to 30% of women with positive results at 35–37 weeks revert to negative by labour, and the large majority of women who are colonised with GBS during labour have healthy neonates who will not suffer from EOGBS.

### Timing and dosage of intrapartum prophylactic penicillin for preventing early-onset group B streptococcal disease: assessing maternal and umbilical cord blood concentration [^1134TbJf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, up to one-third of women in labour receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) as a preventive measure against neonatal early-onset group B streptococcus disease (EOGBS).

Despite a decline, EOGBS still affects approximately 230 000 infants worldwide each year and occurs even in populations with vigorous screening and IAP.

International guidelines outline two main strategies for IAP; universal antepartum culture-based group B streptococcus disease (GBS)-screening or intrapartum, risk factor-based screening. Recently, several European hospitals, including most Danish hospitals, have introduced the intrapartum GBS PCR point-of-care testing (POCT) in women with some of the recognised risk factors, for example, a GBS culture positive urine (≥ 10×4 CFU/mL) during current pregnancy, prolonged rupture of membranes or 35 or 36 weeks gestation at birth of. Then, only PCR-positive women receive IAP.

Standard IAP is penicillin G 3 g followed by 1.5 g every 4 hours until delivery. This recommendation originates from a 1996 CDC guideline and consists of a 4 hourly penicillin G regimen and observation of the infant for at least 48 hours after birth. The penicillin G regimen has been maintained in updates of the guidelines. Current risk assessment for infants born at or after 35 weeks implies 36–48 hours of in-hospital observation.

The rationale behind this treatment regimen is to obtain levels of penicillin above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the fetal blood stream to prevent EOGBS. The exact dose and timing of penicillin for clinical and particularly preventive efficacy is, however, controversial. Unknown factors such as placental transfer, and pharmacokinetics during the latent and active phase of delivery may also influence the concentration in fetal blood. In the neonate, several factors influence the penicillin concentration, including the exceedingly low glomerular filtration rate in the first days after delivery, rapid changes in body composition, neonatal disease, for example, multiorgan hypoxia and ischaemia, and transitional circulatory problems.

### Evaluation of universal antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus [^114jbztb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcal disease is one of the most common infections in the first week after birth. In 2002, national guidelines recommended universal late antenatal screening of pregnant women for colonization with group B streptococcus to identify candidates for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Methods

We evaluated the implementation of the guidelines in a multistate, retrospective cohort selected from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance, a 10-state, population-based system that monitors invasive group B streptococcal disease. We abstracted data from the labor and delivery records of a stratified random sample of live births and of all cases in which the newborn had early-onset group B streptococcal disease (i.e., disease in infants < 7 days of age) in 2003 and 2004. We compared our results with those from a study with a similar design that evaluated screening practices in 1998 and 1999.

Results

We abstracted records of 254 births in which the infant had group B streptococcal disease and 7437 births in which the infant did not. The rate of screening for group B streptococcus before delivery increased from 48.1% in 1998–1999 to 85.0% in 2003–2004; the percentage of infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics increased from 26.8% to 31.7%. Chemoprophylaxis was administered in 87.0% of the women who were positive for group B streptococcus and who delivered at term, but in only 63.4% of women with unknown colonization status who delivered preterm. The overall incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal disease was 0.32 cases per 1000 live births. Preterm infants had a higher incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal disease than did term infants (0.73 vs. 0.26 cases per 1000 live births); however, 74.4% of the cases of group B streptococcal disease (189 of 254) occurred in term infants. Missed screening among mothers who delivered at term accounted for 34 of the 254 cases of group B streptococcal disease (13.4%). A total of 61.4% of the term infants with group B streptococcal disease were born to women who had tested negative for group B streptococcus before delivery.

Conclusions

Recommendations for universal screening were rapidly adopted. Improved management of preterm deliveries and improved collection, processing, and reporting of culture results may prevent additional cases of early-onset group B streptococcal disease.

### Spontaneous vaginal delivery [^116anvsZ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Vaginal delivery is a natural process that usually does not require significant medical intervention. Management guided by current knowledge of the relevant screening tests and normal labor process can greatly increase the probability of an uncomplicated delivery and postpartum course. All women should be screened for group B streptococcus; women who test positive should be treated with antibiotics during labor. Routine human immunodeficiency virus screening of all pregnant women, and treatment with antiretroviral medication for those who test positive, can reduce perinatal transmission of the infection. Once a woman is in labor, management should focus on the goal of delivering a healthy newborn while minimizing discomfort and complications for the mother. In a patient who tests negative for group B streptococcus, delaying admission to the labor ward until she is in active labor decreases the number of possible medical interventions during labor and delivery. Once a patient has been admitted to the hospital, providing her with continuous emotional support can improve delivery outcomes and the birthing experience. Epidural analgesia is effective for pain control and should not be discontinued late in labor to reduce the need for operative vaginal delivery. Epidurals prolong labor, but do not increase the risk of cesarean delivery. Research has shown that labor may not progress as rapidly as historically reported; this should be considered before intervening for dystocia. Routine episiotomy increases morbidity and should be abandoned. Once the infant has been delivered, active management of the third stage of labor decreases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^116Djhd7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Women were eligible for inclusion if they had a singleton pregnancy, attended the Women's and Children's Hospital for their antenatal care over a 13-month period from May 1998 to May, 1999 and expected to deliver at that hospital at term. Women with previous GBS disease were included as were women enrolled in a shared care program between general practitioners and the hospital. Ethics committee approval was obtained from the Women's and Children's Hospital.

Recruitment

Information sessions were held for antenatal clinic and labour ward staff prior to the commencement of recruitment and during the recruitment period, to familiarise staff with the study and incorporate their suggestions into the study protocol if appropriate. Women were informed about the study after their 18-week morphological scan and approached for consent at approximately 28 weeks gestation. Women who consented received vaginal and perianal swabs at 31–33 weeks, 35–38 weeks and during labour. A sample of these women participated in focus groups to explore their views about the collection of swabs antenatally and intra-partum, their attitudes to the prophylactic administration of antibiotics during labour and their understanding about GBS infection.

Although we had intended at the outset to recruit private patients, we could not develop cost-effective strategies for their involvement.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) can cause significant maternal and neonatal morbidity. Over the past 30 years, reductions in early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis in the United States have been attributable to the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for antepartum screening and treating this organism during labor. This article highlights the clinical implications, screening, diagnosis, prophylactic interventions, and future therapies for mothers with GBS during the peripartum period.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine screening for pregnant women for evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and syphilis, and vaginal-rectal colonization with group B Streptococcus For each of these pathogens, there are important opportunities to provide maternal treatment, prevent vertical transmission of the pathogen during the prenatal or intrapartum periods, and/or administer neonatal treatment immediately after birth. Such prevention and/or treatment measures are critical to limiting maternal and neonatal morbidity; however, this is dependent on recognition of maternal disease status. A significant number of women in the United States receive either inadequate prenatal care or inadequate screening for these pathogens. The time of admission to labor and delivery units represents an important opportunity to detect at-risk pregnant women and infants. To optimize both maternal and neonatal health, the Joint Commission issued new guidance effective July 1, 2018, mandating documentation of maternal disease status for these pathogens in the maternal medical record and documentation of positive results in the newborn medical record. Immediate peripartum testing for women with inadequate screening is also required. These measures should allow for timely interventions to improve maternal health and ideally to prevent perinatal disease transmission to the newborn.

Sample size

The proportion of women with risk factors for early-onset GBS infection in their newborns receiving intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was expected to be between 50 and 75%, from previous estimates and expected improvements in adherence to guidelines since then. With a sample size per unit of 83 women and a minimum of 20 units, we expected the trial to have 90% power to detect a reduction to 63% in rapid test units (for a comparative control of 75%), assuming an intracluster coefficient of 0.01. This equated to a total sample size of approximately 664 per strategy group, rounded up to 1340 in total, for the cluster randomised trial.

Intravenous intrapartum antibiotic strategy to prevent early-onset GBS disease

As neonates with GBS EOD are often already septic at birth, with rapid progression of disease, a strong focus has been placed on a secondary preventative strategy to treat at-risk mothers in labour.

Mechanism of action of IAP

Given that maternal rectovaginal colonisation is associated with EOD, IAP aims to reduce the vertical transmission of GBS from mother to baby by decreasing the colony count at time of delivery, and also to achieve an effective level of antibiotic in the fetal circulation. Achieving adequate level of antibiotic in the amniotic fluid may directly protect the neonate against EOD by preventing the proliferation of GBS in utero. Clinical trials in the 1980s demonstrated that IAP reduced the incidence of early neonatal GBS disease and has formed the basis of IAP strategy. A Cochrane review highlighted a statistically significant reduction in the early-onset neonatal GBS disease following IAP compared with no treatment, where in industrialised countries the number needed to treat to benefit was 25 (95% CI 14 to 100).

Choice of antibiotic and duration of administration

Globally, GBS remains fully susceptible to β-lactams, with benzylpenicillinor ampicillinmost commonly administered. Erythromycin and vancomycin have been used; however, their efficacy has not been measured in controlled trials, and the ability of these antibiotics to achieve bactericidal levels in fetal circulation and amniotic fluid is uncertain.

The optimal duration of IAP to reduce vertical GBS transmission has also been debated. While the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends a minimum duration of 4 hours between IAP administration and delivery, several studies have suggested that the duration of antibiotics may be reduced from 4 hours to 1–2 hours prior to delivery. Indeed, benzylpenicillin levels in cord blood have been shown to exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration for GBS as early as 1 hour after maternal administration.

Identifying those women who require IAP

Two common approaches are used to identify pregnant women who should receive IAP: universal screening and a risk-based strategy. More recently, rapid diagnostic tests have been developed.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus disease [^114jjbrS]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important cause of neonatal sepsis in term and preterm infants. Because GBS colonizes human genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, a significant focus of neonatal GBS disease prevention is to interrupt vertical transmission of GBS from mother to infant during parturition. Routine antepartum GBS screening in pregnant women, as well as widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, have aided in overall reductions in neonatal GBS disease during the past 3 decades. However, neonatal GBS disease persists and may cause mortality and significant short- and long-term morbidity among survivors. Herein, we highlight contemporary epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, and the clinical presentation spectrum associated with neonatal GBS disease. We summarize obstetric recommendations for antenatal GBS screening, indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and considerations for antibiotic selection. Finally, we review national guidelines for risk assessment and management of infants at risk for GBS disease.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^115iKTGY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review concluded that the evidence base that addresses the potential impact of widespread use of IAP for the mother (anaphylaxis, antimicrobial resistance, medicalization of labor) and baby (short- and long-term effects on the gut microbiome, longer stay in hospital, antimicrobial resistance) was limited and that additional large, high-quality, and longitudinal observational studies across countries would improve our understanding in this area. Given that in the United Kingdom approximately 20% of women are colonized yet only 1 in 100 infants born to women carrying GBS develop invasive GBS disease, there is a need to understand other factors that contribute to natural protection from infection, such as antibody concentrations. Such data would also facilitate vaccine development and licensure.

A recently published collection of articles highlights the potential global burden and the scale of the problem. Independently (though with overlap with some of the experts), the UK Department of Health (now Department of Health and Social Care) convened a working group to examine some of the research uncertainties that could be tackled in the United Kingdom with appropriately commissioned funding. Here, we present a consensus view on current research gaps in evidence on screening, diagnostic tests, and vaccination, with the aim of stimulating research in this area.

### Rapid intrapartum test for maternal group B streptococcal colonisation and its effect on antibiotic use in labouring women with risk factors for early-onset neonatal infection (GBS2): cluster randomised trial with nested test accuracy study [^112jdQkk]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study setting and participants

Twenty UK maternity units were clusters. The units were eligible to participate if they were prepared to accept a policy of rapid test-directed intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent neonatal early-onset GBS infection and had access to microbiology facilities for selective enrichment bacteriological culture of GBS. Clinical midwives and doctors identified potential participants and screened for eligibility in various locations including the delivery suite, the maternity triage unit or the induction ward. No research-specific consent was obtained for the cluster trial and diagnostic study, although it was for the microbiology sub-study. Women in the rapid test units received information about the test and provided verbal assent to have the vaginal-rectal swab. Pregnant women were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they had one or more of the following risk factors: a previous baby with early- or late-onset GBS disease; GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy (irrespective of whether the GBS bacteriuria was treated at the time of diagnosis with antibiotics); GBS maternal colonisation of the vagina and/or rectum in the current pregnancy; suspected, diagnosed or established preterm labour (less than 37 weeks' gestation); and maternal pyrexia (≥ 38 °C). Women were ineligible if they were under 16 years of age, less than 24 weeks' gestation, were in the second stage of labour at admission or considered likely to give birth to their baby imminently, having a planned elective caesarean birth or their baby was known to have died in utero or had a congenital anomaly incompatible with survival at birth.

Cluster randomised trial

Randomisation and masking

Randomisation of clusters was performed at the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit using a minimisation algorithm incorporating the following factors: region (the Midlands, London and South East England), pre-trial intrapartum antibiotic usage rate (above or below the median of all sites) and the number of vaginal or emergency Caesarean births (above or below the median). Due to the differences in the strategies for testing women and for directing intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, it was not possible to blind women or their care team to the randomised allocation of their maternity unit.

Statistical analysis

All trial analyses were conducted by intention-to-treat analyses according to the randomised allocation of the maternity unit, excluding any units who withdrew before data collection started and participants later found to be ineligible. For participant and cluster characteristics, we summarised the categorical data by frequencies and percentages. We summarised the continuous data by the number of responses, mean and standard deviation if deemed to be normally distributed and by the number of responses, median and interquartile range if the data appeared skewed. For the primary analysis in the cluster randomised trial, we used a mixed effects binomial regression with a log-link to estimate the relative risk, and a binomial model with an identity link to estimate the risk difference. Both models allowed for clustering by maternity unit as a random effect and adjusted for minimisation variables as fixed effects. If the binomial model with the identity link did not converge, we only reported the relative risk. In the case of non-convergence of the binomial model with a log-link, a Poisson model with robust standard errors was fitted. We used Kenward and Roger method to correct the potential inflation of the type I error rate due to the small number of clusters. We used GLIMMIX in SAS to estimate model parameters, using a restricted pseudo-likelihood approach based on a marginal expansion which can be viewed as a generalised form of REML ("RMPL" option in GLIMMIX). A post hoc analysis tested sensitivity to the estimation procedure and small sample correction method by comparing results obtained from an adaptive quadrature method (with between-within small sample correction) and using a between-within correction with a restricted pseudo-likelihood marginal expansion approach (again with a between-within small sample correction). Overall inferences did not change. Where covariate adjustment was not practical, unadjusted estimates were produced and explained (e.g. not possible due to low event rate, lack of model convergence or poor recording accuracy of covariates).

We pre-specified subgroup analyses for the effects of the rapid test on the primary outcome in each of the categories based on the following maternal risk factors: maternal temperature of 38 °C or above observed whilst in labour, previous baby with GBS disease, GBS detected in current pregnancy and preterm labour (< 37 weeks' gestation). We summarised the treatment effects within each sub-group separately and performed an interaction test between each subgroup variable and the test strategy allocation.

### Compliance with group B. streptococcus testing prior to labor and delivery [^114LAP9T]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

We tested whether group B streptococcus (GBS) screening is performed as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and evaluated the need for a rapid GBS test for women with full-term pregnancies. A retrospective cohort analysis at a single, large academic institution was performed. Women who delivered full-term (> 37 weeks) infants and had documented prenatal care were included. The primary outcome was documented screening. One hundred sixty-five full-term pregnancies were included; 158 women [95.76%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 92.68 to 98.83%] were screened prior to presentation at labor and delivery. This frequency was significantly greater than the a priori hypothesis of 90% (P = 0.01). Of the 158 women ever screened, 15 had GBS bacteriuria and 143 had genital culture performed. However, only 118 of the 143 (80.61%; 95% CI, 74.57 to 86.64%) were cultured at the appropriate time as recommended by the CDC (between 35 and 37 weeks). This screening frequency was significantly lower than the a priori hypothesis of 90% (P < 0.001). Most full-term women presenting to labor and delivery have been screened for GBS. However, screening performed at the appropriate gestational age per CDC recommendations was lower than expected. Rapid GBS testing does not appear to be necessary for this population.

### Challenges in reducing group B. streptococcus disease in African settings [^112gSmJw]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Intrapartum GBS screening with rapid real-time PCR testing was recommended by the Consensus Conference on GBS in Europe in 2014. However, the cost to implement and requirements for appropriate reagent storage and supply would make this a less attractive and practical alternative in the resource-poor setting. A simple, cheap point-of-care test could improve the timely implementation of IAP (figure 1).

Figure 1

A possible variation to the use of IAP is to revisit the efficacy of maternal intramuscular and high-dose oral antibiotics in labour, which potentially circumvents the problem of delivering intravenous antibiotics in primary healthcare or home settings. The pharmacokinetics and drug concentration in utero need to be further evaluated, and ultimately, if promising, these need to be tested in controlled trials.

Infectious diseases during pregnancy can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both the pregnant patient and the fetus, screening for infectious diseases, counseling, and treatment can improve maternal and fetal outcomes, and Group B streptococcus infections are the leading cause of serious neonatal infections (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia) within the first 7 days of life (early-onset infection).

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus disease can be very serious, even deadly, for babies.
- Learn about the steps healthcare providers can take to prevent GBS disease during the first week of a newborn's life. Overview The best way to prevent GBS disease during the first week of life is to give antibiotics, during labor, to women at increased risk. All pregnant women should get screened for GBS bacteria. Keep Reading: GBS Screening During Pregnancy. Antibiotics during labor Healthcare providers give antibiotics to women who are at increased risk of having a baby who will develop GBS disease. The antibiotics help protect babies from infection, but only if given during labor. Antibiotics can't be given before labor begins because the bacteria can grow back quickly. Healthcare providers give the antibiotic by IV. Beta-lactams are the type of antibiotic prescribed the most during labor to prevent GBS disease.

Penicillin and ampicillin are examples of beta-lactams. However, healthcare providers can give other antibiotics to women who are severely allergic to these antibiotics. Why prevention is important Antibiotics are very safe About 1 in 10 women have mild side effects from receiving penicillin. There's a rare chance of having a severe allergic reaction that requires emergency treatment. Antibiotics are very effective Antibiotics are very effective at preventing GBS disease in newborns. Consider the following examples: Treated with antibiotics got antibioticsduring labor. well protectedfrom GBS disease. No antibiotics didn't get antibioticsduring labor. 20 times more likelyto get GBS disease compared to Tanya's baby.

### Association between intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B. streptococcus colonization and clinical chorioamnionitis among patients undergoing induction of labor at term [^116Lgi3w]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Rectovaginal colonization with Group B Streptococcus during pregnancy has historically been shown to be associated with an increased risk of clinical chorioamnionitis and peripartum infectious morbidity.

Objective

Newer observational data in the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis suggest a possible reversal of this association; however, it is unclear if this is related to differences in labor management for those with and without Group B Streptococcus colonization. We therefore sought to assess the association between intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B Streptococcus colonization and clinical chorioamnionitis within the context of a randomized induction of labor trial with a standardized labor protocol.

Study Design

We performed an exploratory secondary analysis of a randomized trial of patients undergoing term induction at a tertiary care center. Patients received third trimester Group B Streptococcus screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis as routine care. Group B Streptococcus detection was performed using a carrot broth-enhanced subculture to Group B Streptococcus Detect approach (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). Labor management was protocolized per the trial. Patients with unknown Group B Streptococcus status or who did not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, if indicated, were excluded. The primary outcome was diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis, compared between patients who received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for known Group B Streptococcus positive status (by culture, history, or Group B Streptococcus bacteriuria) and those who were Group B Streptococcus negative and did not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Secondary outcomes included postpartum endometritis, wound infection, a composite maternal peripartum infectious morbidity, and neonatal outcomes.

Results

A total of 491 patients were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 466 had a known Group B Streptococcus status and received or did not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis accordingly and were included in this analysis: 292 (62.7%) were Group B Streptococcus negative and did not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and 174 (37.3%) were Group B Streptococcus positive and received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The majority of patients were Non-Hispanic Black (78.1%) and nulliparous (59.7%). There were no differences in demographic, clinical, induction or labor characteristics between groups. Patients who were Group B Streptococcus positive had a 49% lower rate of clinical chorioamnionitis (8.1% vs 14.7%, odds ratio, 0.51; p = 0.03) and a lower rate of peripartum infectious morbidity (8.1% vs 15.8%, odds ratio, 0.47; p = 0.02) compared to those who were Group B Streptococcus negative. Infants born to patients who were Group B Streptococcus positive were significantly less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (3.4% vs 15.1%, P < .001).

Conclusion

Although Group B Streptococcus colonization has historically been considered a risk factor for clinical chorioamnionitis, in the era of universal antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B Streptococcus positive patients, our findings support the point that intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B Streptococcus positivity is associated with lower rates of clinical chorioamnionitis and peripartum infectious morbidity among patients undergoing induction with protocolized labor management. These findings demonstrate that intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B Streptococcus may protect against perinatal infectious morbidity, a phenomenon that warrants further investigation.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114wMQR6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vertical transmission of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is the most common cause of early onset neonatal sepsis and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the newborn. To date, the only effective strategy to reduce the risk of early onset neonatal GBS disease is intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis in mothers who are known or suspected to be colonized with GBS. Implementation of national guidelines has led to a drastic decline of early onset neonatal GBS sepsis, with a nearly 8-fold decrease since 1990. Beta-lactam antibiotics, specifically penicillin and cephalosporins, are considered first-line for GBS prophylaxis because they are highly effective, have a narrow spectrum of activity, and are less likely to result in antibiotic-related complications. Unfortunately, a penicillin allergy is commonly reported with roughly 10% of the U.S. population reporting a history of a penicillin allergy, although most are unverified. The existing literature shows that there is significant variability in appropriate antibiotic selection for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis, particularly for pregnant individuals who report a penicillin allergy. Alternative antibiotics, such as clindamycin and vancomycin, are often used for patients who report a penicillin allergy even though most have a low-risk allergy or do not have a confirmed true allergy. Inappropriate use of beta-lactam alternatives has been associated with worse outcomes for non-pregnant patients and increased healthcare utilization costs. In pregnant patients, being labeled with a penicillin allergy has been associated with increased maternal morbidities and longer length of hospital stay. However, less is known about the impact of a maternal beta-lactam allergy label on the neonate in the setting of GBS prophylaxis.

While studies have shown that alternative antibiotics such as clindamycin and vancomycin can reach therapeutic levels in the fetus, they have not been demonstrated to effectively prevent neonatal GBS disease and may in fact be associated with increased rates of neonatal early-onset GBS disease. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not consider these antibiotics to be adequate prophylaxis. If a pregnant mother receives alternative antibiotics and then experiences any risk factors for neonatal GBS infection, such as fever, preterm labor or prolonged rupture of membranes, the neonate must be considered at higher risk of early onset GBS infection. During the time of our data collection (2005–2018), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that this subset of higher risk infants should undergo laboratory testing to assess for infection, with some of these infants going on to receive empiric antibiotics if labs were abnormal.

### Self-collection of samples for group B. streptococcus testing during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mLCoG]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for policy, clinical practice, and future research

Our findings support offering the choice of sample self-collection for GBS detection in antenatal care settings, particularly given the high sensitivity and specificity of self-collected compared to provider-collected samples, and the finding that many people accept (and even prefer) this approach. However, given the limited evidence base, with all studies at high or unclear risk of bias, caution must be taken when interpreting the meta-analysis findings of sensitivity and specificity. No studies were found on the effect of self-collection on maternal, perinatal, or neonatal health outcomes, so we could not explore whether this strategy is better or worse in terms of pregnancy-related outcomes. WHO guidelines note that large multicentre trials are needed to evaluate the effects GBS screening and confirm whether screening reduces preterm birth and perinatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries.

### Perinatal screening for group B streptococci: cost-benefit analysis of rapid polymerase chain reaction [^117ARZM3]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the costs and benefits of a group B streptococci screening strategy using a new, rapid polymerase chain reaction test in a hypothetical cohort of expectant mothers in the United States.

Design

Cost-benefit analysis using the human capital method. We developed a decision model to analyze the costs and benefits of a hypothetical group B streptococci screening strategy using a new, rapid polymerase chain reaction test as compared with the currently recommended group B streptococci screening guidelines-prenatal culture performed at 35 to 37 weeks or risk-factor-based strategy with subsequent intrapartum treatment of the expectant mothers with antibiotics to prevent early-onset group B streptococcal infections in their infants.

Participants

A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women and their newborns.

Interventions

Screening strategies for group B streptococci using the new polymerase chain reaction technique, the 35- to 37-week culture, or maternal risk factors.

Outcome Measures

Infant infections averted, infant deaths, infant disabilities, costs, and societal benefits of healthy infants.

Results

A screening strategy using the new polymerase chain reaction test generates a net benefit of $7 per birth when compared with the maternal risk-factor strategy. For every 1 million births, 80 700 more women would receive antibiotics, 884 fewer infants would become infected with early-onset group B streptococci, and 23 infants would be saved from death or disability. The polymerase chain reaction-based strategy generates a net benefit of $6 per birth when compared with the 35- to 37-week prenatal culture strategy and results in fewer maternal courses of antibiotics (64 080 per million births), fewer perinatal infections with early-onset group B streptococci (218/million), and a reduction in 6 infant deaths and severe infant disability per million births. The benefits hold over a wide range of assumptions regarding key factors in the analysis.

Conclusions

Although additional clinical trials are needed to establish the accuracy of this new polymerase chain reaction test, initial studies suggest that strategies using this test will be superior to the other 2 strategies. Using the rapid polymerase chain reaction test becomes less attractive as the cost of the test increases. The test's greatest strengths lie in its ability to identify women and infants at risk at the time of labor, thereby decreasing the number of false-positives and false-negatives seen with the other 2 strategies and allowing for more accurate and effective intrapartum prophylaxis.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^1153TJBm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Within Australia there is considerable variation in clinical practice in both the prevention of GBS sepsis in neonates and in practitioner opinions as to the appropriate approach to screening for and treatment of GBS. Such variation in views amongst obstetricians and neonatologists reflects uncertainty about the application of differing hospital guidelines.

The current strategy at The Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH) in Adelaide for the prevention of GBS infection in the newborn includes the administration of prophylactic antibiotics during labour to women identified as being colonised with GBS, following universal screening with prenatal low vaginal cultures at 32 weeks gestation.

This study was designed to provide a scientific basis for optimum timing and method of GBS screening as specified in guidelines for antenatal care, to determine whether screening for GBS infection at 35–37 weeks gestation has better predictive values for colonisation at birth than screening at 31–33 weeks, to examine the test characteristics of a risk factor strategy and to determine the test characteristics of low vaginal swabs alone compared with a combination of perianal plus low vaginal swabs per colonisation during labour.

### Challenges in reducing group B. streptococcus disease in African settings [^111AvQwc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in high-income settings and is associated with high rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that there is a high GBS disease burden in resource-limited countries, and it is therefore critically important to identify suitable and practical preventive strategies. In Europe and North America, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has led to a dramatic reduction of early-onset GBS disease. However, the methods for identifying pregnant women who should receive IAP and how to reduce late-onset GBS disease are not without controversy and are challenging for most sub-Saharan African countries. GBS vaccines are approaching phase III trials but are still under development. This review aims to explore the current evidence related to strategies for reducing invasive GBS disease in an African setting, the development of a GBS vaccine and whether preventative measures against GBS disease can be practically implemented.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin, unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis. Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to current best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines. There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS positive mothers. Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. As such, in August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact to neonates born to individuals with penicillin allergy who are treated with alternate GBS intrapartum prophylaxis antibiotics. Provider education and incorporation of screening and testing for penicillin allergy should be considered as part of routine prenatal care to optimize care of the mother-infant dyad.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the type of intrapartum antibiotics used for GBS prophylaxis in pregnant individuals with and without a documented penicillin allergy and to investigate any associated differences in the medical management of their newborn infants.
